   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly discuss S. 2589, the Meeting America's Investment Needs in Small Towns Act, or the MAIN Street Act as I call it. Not only is Main Street the acronym formed by this title, but it goes to the heart of why this legislation is necessary. 
   As we move into the new economy, money is flowing from our small towns and communities to the larger financial markets. While each individual investment decision may make sense, the cumulative effect is a wealth drain from rural America. Money invested in Wall Street is not invested on Main Street. Wall Street wizards can work wonders with a portfolio, but they don't fund a new hardware store down the street. They don't go the extra mile to help a struggling farmer whose family they have served for years. And they don't sponsor the local softball team. 
   By increasing the federally insured deposit level, we can help community banks and thrifts compete for scarce deposits. My legislation will account for the erosion to FDIC-insured levels from 1980. It will index these levels into the future, protecting against further erosions. 
   Under current calculations, the immediate impact would be to almost double the insured funds, from $100,000 to approximately $197,000. The long range impact of this legislation would be to make locally based financial institutions more competitive for deposits, help stem the dwindling deposit base many areas face, and lead to new investments in our communities. 
   Congress last addressed the issue of a deposit insurance increase in 1980. At that time, we increased the insured level from $40,000 to $100,000. Congress has not adjusted that level since 1980. In real terms, inflation has eroded almost half of that protection. 
   Every bank or thrift customer knows that the FDIC insures deposits up to $100,000. For many people, that notice symbolizes that the financial might of the United States government stands behind their banking institution. We learned the hard lessons of the 1930s, and created the FDIC to protect and strengthen our financial system. 
   In rural communities across America, local banks serve as the hub of the town. Every business in town relies on the bank for funding. The banker knows the town, and the town knows the banker. In many ways, each knows it disappears without the other. 
   Individuals in these towns like to know who is handling their money. They like the idea that their funds are secure in their home town. And, they like the fact that their money can be leveraged into other investments that will improve their communities. The more deposits a bank has, the more loans it can make. These loans are made locally, and serve as an investment in local communities.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to honor Marilyn Herz, a sixth grade language arts teacher from Rapid City, who has recently been named South Dakota's Teacher of the Year for 2001. 
   Marilyn currently teaches at West Middle School in Rapid City and has taught various grade levels in the Rapid City Area School District since 1983. She has devoted an impressive 22 years of her life to teaching elementary school. 
   Marilyn's greatest service to our community lies in her devotion as an educator to her students. She deserves the greatest praise both from the families of these young individuals, and from all those whose lives she will touch. Her efforts are an invaluable investment in South Dakota's future and we are all truly blessed to have her in the classroom. 
   In a true testimony of Marilyn's devotion and love for teaching, she commented that her greatest contribution to education is simply that she has given, and will continue to give, all the caring, commitment, and compassion that she has within her to guide students to succeed academically, emotionally, and socially. 
   Marilyn also makes extra efforts to see that her classes are learning to their potential and preparing themselves for the demands of the 21st century. A true veteran in the field of education, Marilyn's efforts to increase the credibility of teaching as a profession is designed to entice and encourage a new generation of students into following her in this most honorable profession. 
   Marilyn will now proceed to the national competition for Teacher of the Year. I express my appreciation for the Rapid City Public School Foundation for sponsoring the Teacher of the Year program in the Rapid City School District. As well, I congratulate all of the South Dakota teachers nominated this year. 
   I commend Marilyn for her outstanding service to the youth of our community. Congratulations and thank you, Marilyn, for your commitment to excellence and dedicated service to your students, your community, and to South Dakota.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Virginia Driving Hawk Sneve for being awarded the National Humanities Medal for 2000 presented to her by the President of the United States. Virginia is the first South Dakotan to receive this prestigious award, and I am pleased that she is being recognized for her extraordinary contributions as an author, a counselor, and a teacher. 
   As you know, the National Humanities Medal honors individuals whose work enhances the nation's understanding of the humanities while also preserving Americans' access to important resources about their history and society. The humanities preserve the voices of generations through history, literature, philosophy, religion, languages, and archaeology. However, the humanities are not simply records of past eras; they are an essential part to the development and understanding of our current culture and definition of who we are as Americans. 
   Born on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Virginia Driving Hawk Sneve has become one of the nation's preeminent storytellers. Virginia's stories often come straight from her experiences growing up on the reservation and help give an accurate portrayal of her ancestors' lives in the Dakotas. Her children's books have won numerous awards, including national competitions for minority children's books, because of their unique and poignant mixture of recorded events and imagination. 
   Virginia has also given us valuable works of literature about the American Indian written from the female perspective. In her award-winning work, Completing the Circle, Virginia breaks the historic mold of denoting Native American women either as princesses like Pocohontas'' or noble savages like Sacagawea.'' The result is an educational account of the strengths and weaknesses of the Sioux culture from the female point of view. Virginia's research and writings have helped others to understand the high level of esteem held by the Sioux for women--a lesson from which Native American society and non-Indian cultures can draw guidance and appreciation. 
   I applaud Virginia for the literary works she has given us and for her continued teaching, counseling, and mentoring in South Dakota. Virginia's words, either on paper or in person, have opened a nation's eyes to the lives of Native Americans and will prove to be the foundation from which other Native American writers, especially women, will continue to explore their unique heritage and society. Virginia Driving Hawk Sneve is a national treasure and the pride of South Dakota.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to commend an individual who has provided immeasurable service to the family farmers and ranchers in my home state of South Dakota over the past eight years. Mr. Michael O'Connor has been the South Dakota State Executive Director for the Farm Service Agency, FSA, of United States Department of Agriculture, USDA. He was originally named the South Dakota State Executive Director of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service of USDA by President Clinton in 1993. His current responsibilities include supervising activity in 60 county FSA field offices across the state. 
   As this Administration draws to a close, we sadly must say goodbye to some experienced, tireless, and talented people who have dedicated their professional careers to public service. Mike is one of those public servants, and so on behalf of the citizens of South Dakota, it is my honor to express our sincere gratitude to Mike O'Connor for his countless contributions and achievements. 
   Throughout his career Mike has aggressively served the agricultural community in South Dakota through positions of leadership in the South Dakota Farmers Union, the Clay-Union Electric Board of Directors, the South Dakota Corn Utilization Council Board of Directors, and the Union County Pork Producers. He also served in as a representative in South Dakota Legislature from 1987-1993. 
   Moreover, Mike, his wife Janelle, and their family have devoted their lives to production agriculture, operating a diversified grain and livestock farm for over 30 years near Alcester, South Dakota. 
   Mike has been a valuable resource for me and a determined advocate of family farmers as we developed and implemented farm programs. He is constantly trying to improve the delivery system with the interests of family farmers close to his heart, always searching for ways to implement programs that are fair and equitable to all. Mike exhibits the courage to take on the status quo, and demonstrates a will to ensure integrity in program delivery for agricultural producers. 
   Mike has guided innumerable disaster and assistance programs from the federal level to local disbursement in South Dakota. He and his top-notch staff have been asked to implement these ad hoc disaster programs in addition to the day-to-day administrative requirements of current farm and conservation programs. From marketing loans and loan deficiency payments to production flexibility contract payments and market loss payments, to loan and conservation programs, to crop loss disaster payments, Mike has seen it all. He has worked with his statewide staff to administer these programs and distribute payments in an effective, timely fashion to South Dakota farmers. In this last fiscal year alone, the South Dakota FSA, under Mike's direction, has delivered over $750 million to farm program participants in South Dakota. Mere words cannot describe everything that Mike has done to serve the farmers and ranchers in South Dakota through such an awful period of economic distress. Mike is as respected in Washington, D.C. as he is in South Dakota, and his working knowledge of the intricacies of farm bill will be missed. 
   Therefore, it is with a sense of pride and yet, regret, that I wish Mike well in his future endeavors. 
   Mr. President, I thank you and wish Mike, Janelle, and their family success in their future plans. I know that we will continue to work together, as Mike will continue to provide a respected opinion that I will seek out during the upcoming Congressional farm bill debate. On behalf of the people of South Dakota, I want to thank Mike for being a true public servant who has helped improve the quality of life for farmers and ranchers all across South Dakota.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dallas Tonsager for his years of extraordinary public service as South Dakota's State Director of the United States Department of Agriculture's, USDA, Rural Development, RD, office. Dallas has been a tireless advocate on behalf of rural communities and area residents. His commitment and dedication to ensure the long-term viability of rural communities will continue to cultivate opportunities for rural growth and prosperity for many years to come. Dallas has earned the respect and friendship of those who know him in South Dakota, Washington, D.C. and around the country. On behalf of the citizens of South Dakota, it is my honor to express our sincere gratitude to Dallas Tonsager for his countless contributions and achievements. 
   In 1993, President Clinton asked Dallas to bring his talent, integrity, ingenuity, and initiative to federal service to help the Administration address the concerns of Rural America. Dallas accepted the challenge and was appointed director of the former South Dakota Farmers Home Administration by President Clinton. Currently he oversees approximately 80 employees across the state in several Rural Development offices. Prior to his USDA service, Dallas was a two-term South Dakota Farmers Union President, first elected in 1987. Dallas, his wife Sharon, and their family continue to actively participate in a diversified family farm partnership near Oldham, South Dakota. It is clear that from his roots on the family farm, to his service for South Dakota Farmers Union and USDA, Dallas has always had the perspective of the hard working, rural, South Dakota citizen close to his heart. Indeed, he is respected by his colleagues across the country and was presented with the ``Hammer Award,'' by Vice-President GORE in 1995. In 1999, Dallas was recognized as one of two Outstanding Rural Development State Directors in the entire nation by USDA Rural Development Under Secretary Jill Long Thompson. 
   Rural Development takes a comprehensive approach towards economic development in rural areas, offering loans, grants, and other resources to rural citizens, communities, and Indian reservations. Dallas truly served as a partner in helping the people of rural South Dakota develop sustainable communities. He and his RD staff targeted financial and technical resources to areas of great need throughout the state in order to improve the quality of life. In his Rural Development tenure, Dallas has overseen the distribution of over $578 million in grants, loans and loan guarantees over the past six years in South Dakota. As such, the South Dakota RD office has been a central figure in the creation of many successful economic development projects in our state. 
   For instance, the South Dakota Rural Development office was responsible for helping to create one of the first Enterprise Communities in the country--the Beadle and Spink Enterprise Community, BASEC. Additionally, RD assisted in developing the very first American Indian Empowerment Zone in the United States at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Under the leadership of Dallas, Rural Development helped establish the South Dakota Value Added Agriculture Development Center , which now creates opportunities for farmers and ranchers to add value to the raw commodities produced on their operations, and capture the profits from these value-added products. Dallas is one of South Dakota's leading advocates of farmer-owned value-added cooperatives in South Dakota. 
   Through the Rural Housing Service, South Dakota Rural Development has disbursed $320 million since 1995, which has benefitted nearly 6,000 families in our state. Moreover, RD has distributed $173 million in funding under the Rural Business Cooperative Service program, which has saved 2,001 and created another 1,414 jobs in South Dakota since 1995. 
   Finally, Dallas and his family have always been dedicated to public service, and I know he will continue to contribute to our state and it's citizens in the future. Therefore, I wish him all the best and I will continue to rely upon his valuable insight on the economic development needs in South Dakota. On behalf of the people of South Dakota, I want to thank Dallas for being a true public servant who has helped improve the quality of life for thousands of people all across South Dakota.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Josh Heupel, a native of Aberdeen, South Dakota. All of South Dakota, and especially Aberdeen, is extremely proud of Josh, one of four finalists for the Heisman Trophy. The Heisman Trophy is presented annually to the nation's top collegiate football player. 
   Josh is the starting quarterback of the number one ranked and undefeated Oklahoma Sooners, 12-0. Josh has passed for 3,392 yards and 20 touchdowns this year which makes him one of the Heisman favorites. Josh has led the Oklahoma Sooners through a very difficult schedule, which included two wins against top ten ranked Kansas State and overcame an early 14 point deficit against the then number one ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers. Josh is preparing for the National Championship game on January 3, 2001 against the Florida State Seminoles. No matter what the outcome is, I know the entire state is very proud of Josh and grateful he has conducted himself in a way that shines greatly on South Dakota. 
   I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Ken and Cindy Heupel, Josh's parents, on Josh's success. As the father of three children who have participated in extracurricular activities, I can imagine how proud Ken and Cindy must feel today. Ken is currently the Head Football Coach at Northern State University in Aberdeen and Cindy is the principal at Aberdeen Central High School. 
   Again, my congratulations to Josh Heupel and his family on behalf of the entire state of South Dakota.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to review where we stand, near the conclusion of the 106th Congress, on the subject of prescription drugs. Few issues have caught the public's attention more than this one, and few are more deserving of our attention. 
   We live at a time when we can clearly discern remarkable benefits from all manner of drugs. It is nothing short of miraculous when we consider the relative ease and success of today's treatment of common disorders, as compared with that of only two or three generations ago. 
   When World War II began, for example, penicillin and other similar antibiotics were known only to a small number of scientists. At the conclusion of the War in 1945, penicillin was widely available, used not only for battle wounds but for infectious diseases in the general public as well. Patients with high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels were, at best, only partially and inadequately treated in the 1940's and 1950's. Now success is the rule, rather than the exception. Calvin Coolidge's son died in 1924 as a result of a blister and a skin infection after playing tennis at the White House. An infection like that today would be treated as simple, outpatient therapy. 
   While these examples are noteworthy and provide us with a valuable perspective of times gone by, the hard, cold fact is that many of these modern miracles are still out of the reach of too many American citizens. They simply cannot afford the drugs that might so often prove lifesaving, because of either no insurance or lack of drug coverage within their insurance. 
   Why is this? Because, astronomical prices have come hand-in-hand with the great improvements in drug therapy. Spending for prescription drugs in the United States doubled between 1990 and 1998. In each of the five years between 1993 and 1998, prescription drug spending increased by an average of 12.4 percent. In 1999, the increase was 19 percent. We could go into all the reasons, but the fact remains that prescription drug prices are high and getting higher. 
   Many millions of Americans, both Medicare age and younger have either inadequate or no prescription drug insurance at all. A by-product of no coverage is that these patients wind up paying the highest rates of anyone--an average of 15 percent more than those with insurance. Many of these uninsureds, including the seniors often called The Greatest Generation'' are not filling prescriptions because of their cost--choosing between food and medicine. Or they split pills in half to make them go farther. This is shameful. These are very real every day problems that beg for help. 
   So, given the fact of these well documented problems, what is the track record of this Congress in helping the citizens in my home state of South Dakota and the citizens of the United  States? What do I tell my constituents back in Sioux Falls, or Custer, or Milbank when they ask me why nothing has been done to help them? I wish I could tell them that help is on the way. I wish I could tell them that the majority leadership heard their voices and scheduled the hearings and called for the votes. But, that just is not the case. 
   Early in this Congress, I introduced, along with Senator KENNEDY, the Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors of Act of 1999''. This bill would provide Medicare beneficiaries access to prescription drugs at the same low prices that drug manufacturers offer their most favored customers, such as large insurance companies, HMO's, and the Federal Government. Without cost to the taxpayers, my proposal could save seniors approximately 40 percent on their drug bills, yet we did not see a vote on this floor. 
   Similarly, in May of this year, I introduced the Generic Pharmaceutical Access and Choice for Consumers Act''. This bill encourages the broader use of generics in Federal health programs, a straight-forward common sense approach, yet we did not see a vote on this floor. 
   Other measures that could have made a tremendous difference to millions of Americans also languished. This Congress should have passed a voluntary universal Medicare drug benefit plan. It did not. 
   This Congress should have addressed rising drug prices. It did not. 
   This Congress should have passed a truly strong and effective drug reimportation plan. It did not. 
   This Congress should have passed a generic drug access plan. It did not. 
   Mr. President, let me conclude by stating that these problems will not go away. Nor will my commitment for their resolution on behalf of the people of South Dakota and Americans across this country. The hope that this Congress will seriously address prescription drug costs and provide comprehensive Medicare drug coverage yet this year is all but an aspiration at this point. That being said, in a few months we will commence the 107th Congress. I will continue to do all that I can to work with my colleagues and urge the earliest possible discussions regarding prescription drugs in committee rooms and on the floor of the Senate. I believe this is the wish of most of the members in this body, as well as the wish and hope of the American people.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, throughout the past year, I continued working with local and state community leaders and law enforcement officials all across South Dakota in an effort to find solutions to the most pressing problems facing the people of my state. A number of issues that Congress can address were brought to my attention through these meetings, and I continue to find this statewide dialog extremely valuable on further developing a community approach to reducing crime. I've worked on a bipartisan basis with my colleagues in the United States Senate to help South Dakota communities get the resources they need to address the crime problems they face.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my appreciation for the contributions of Brian Kaatz, Pharm. D. who has worked as part of my staff for the past three months as a senior Fellow. Brian's expertise in the area of pharmacology has made him a tremendous asset to my legislative staff, and I am fortunate to have had his assistance. When he returns to the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at South Dakota State University in December, I know he will be missed immensely by me and my entire staff. 
   Fellows are often considered secret weapons to the Members they assist. Brian has been no exception. He came to my office with a distinguished professional career accompanied by a wealth of experience within the pharmacy industry. While his expertise lies in clinical pharmacy, Brian's interests range from issues involving infectious diseases and use of antibiotics, nutrition, health care ethics, drug policy and roles for pharmacists. 
   Currently a Professor and Department Head of Clinical Pharmacy at the South Dakota State University, Brian has had a career filled with accomplishments. He has been president of the South Dakota Society of Hospital Pharmacists, a member of the committee that re-wrote the pharmacy practice act passed by the South Dakota legislature in 1992, an official delegate several times to the American Society of Health-System Pharmacy annual meeting, and served as a consultant to several South Dakota hospitals and law firms. Additionally, Brian has authored or co-authored approximately twenty-five professional articles and is currently the editor of the South Dakota Journal of Medicine's Pharmacology Focus column, published monthly in South Dakota's Physician Journal. He has made numerous major presentations both regionally and nationally, and received several awards over the years for his notable career. 
   Throughout the past three months, Brian has worked on a number of projects in my office dealing with pharmacy and health care. Brian led research efforts regarding a comprehensive study comparing prescription drug prices throughout South Dakota and the impact of rising drug costs on those without insurance. Many millions of Americans, both Medicare age and younger have either inadequate or no prescription drug insurance at all. There are roughly 39 million Medicare beneficiaries in this country, one third of whom have no prescription drug coverage. At a time, when drug prices are rising at rates far greater than the rate of inflation and seniors around this country are forced to choose between buying food or pills, we have an inadequate Medicare program that provides no coverage for prescription drug costs. The study that Brian spearheaded provided me with crucial data and real life stories depicting the impact of this issue for South Dakotans, young and old alike. Brian's research furnished my office with up-to-date and unbiased information that enabled me to communicate effectively with my constituents, especially pharmacists, during this time. Unfortunately, Congress was not able to come to an agreement on how we provide Medicare beneficiaries with prescription drug coverage, therefore the information that Brian compiled for me will be critically important as I work on this issue in the 107th Congress next year. 
   Brian also facilitated discussions with the Government Accounting Office, GAO, on two subject matters involving direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs and conflict of interest matters involving the Food and Drug Administration's Advisory Committee members. The research Brian conducted in these two areas will provide me with the basis for further discussions with GAO and congressional committees seeking hearings into these matters. Brian previously authored and co-authored two articles specifically on the subject of direct-to-consumer advertising and has completed extensive research in this field.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned that important efforts to support small businesses are jeopardized by the many unrelated amendments that have been added to H.R. 2614 the Small Business, Health, Tax, and Minimum Wage Act. I ask my colleagues to join me in working to pass important legislation vital to preserve the Certified Development Company Program, the Small Business Innovation Research Program, and the reauthorization of the Small Businesses Administration. As Congress prepares to adjourn, it is irresponsible to prevent action on these important issues. 
   I am very concerned that innocent provisions that support small businesses and job creation are being held hostage in a debate over unrelated issues. H.R. 2614 was introduced as a bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act to make improvements to the certified development company program. This program provides gap financing which is vital to foster entrepreneurship and create economic opportunities. In recent days, however, this bill has been loaded down with numerous provisions that completely overshadow this program and threaten to shatter our chance to authorize these programs before Congress adjourns. 
   I am proud to speak out on behalf of the real intent of H.R. 2614 which would help small businesses succeed. There is an old proverb used in my state of South Dakota which advises; ``Don't put off until tomorrow what can be done today.'' Today, we should strip out the politically charged amendments that have been tacked onto this bill and pass legislation both parties agree is important to our economy, our local communities, and many businesses and families across the country. 
   It is careless not to reauthorize these important programs because of election year politics which bogged down the legislation with unrelated issues. Congress should vote on the genuine issues with regard to small business programs. We must not let certain partisan differences cause us to turn away from our opportunity to promote the entrepreneurial spirit of our country. 
   There are many issues before this body which evoke strong differences of opinion, however, authorizing these important small business programs are not among them. I urge my colleagues to join me in securing the passage of this important legislation and not allow these widely supported initiatives to fall victim to nonrelated amendments thrown together in the closing days of Congress.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, anyone who has lived or visited in the United States during the last few years has been exposed to a phenomenon which is uniquely American. I speak of the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines. 
   U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers will spend an amount this year very close to $2 billion on advertising to the general public. This can be compared to about just $150 million in 1993--which explains why no one can avoid these advertisements even if they wanted to. They are ubiquitous--TV, radio, newspapers, and magazines are all replete with prescription drug ads. 
   Typically, the drugs that are most heavily advertised are among those that ultimately are the most heavily prescribed. According to a recently released National Institute for Health Care Management study, for example, the seven drugs in 1999 which had more than $1 billion in sales were advertised an average of $58.5 million each. Together, they contributed an estimated 24.3 percent toward the increases in total expenditures of prescription drugs during 1999. 
   Clearly, advertising works, just as it always has. 
   Advocates of this relatively new technique to increase name brand prescription sales will say that consumers become more aware of treatment possibilities and may have a better starting point for discussion with their physicians. Other observers believe this practice artificially increases demand from consumers who are still not fully  educated enough to know about less expensive, or maybe even safer, alternatives. Certainly, the advertising costs are passed along to the consumer. 
   Is the information value worth the yearly increases in drug costs that advertising inevitably causes? Are patients getting the best individualized choices of medicines or the just best advertised ones? Are generic drugs, often an excellent cost-effective alternative, getting equal consideration? 
   Frankly, I have my concerns about this practice. Many professional organizations have gone on record as opposing the kinds of direct-to-consumer advertising that goes on today. I believe it bears very close watching and we all need to closely scrutinize its value and its place within the health care system.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, every year in October there is recognition made of our nation's pharmacists in the form of National Pharmacy Week. This year's designation was October 22-28, 2000. I would like to take a few minutes to talk about that profession and its role in the safe, cost-effective delivery of medication to American citizens. 
   I have great respect for the innovation that this nation's scientists have demonstrated to continually produce new and better ``wonder drugs'' that have played a major role in the prevention and treatment of disease. Farther down the line within the drug delivery system are pharmacists, using those same drugs every day, getting them to patients along with information for their safe use. 
   The role of the pharmacist is changing. In addition to the traditional role of accurately dispensing prescription drugs, today's pharmacists are successfully involved in all areas of the drug use process. The result of this involvement, often termed ``pharmacy care'' has made a huge positive difference in many studies within the areas of anticoagulation, asthma and diabetes treatment, pain control and many others. When pharmacists are proactively involved, there have been demonstrations of not only increased effectiveness and fewer adverse reactions, but cost savings as well. 
   Within the startling report issued earlier this year by the Institute of Medicine, which pointed out that tens of thousands of American die every year from medical errors, was a recommendation to increase the utilization of pharmacists and pharmacy care. 
   So today I would like to congratulate the pharmacy profession for its accomplishments in improving patient care. During this Congress several bills have included provisions to encourage and support pharmacy care. I believe this is a fascinating approach that we should strongly consider as we continue to work toward optimizing the safe and cost-effective use of prescription drugs.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr.President, I rise today to commend the Sawtooth Hotshots for their valiant efforts in fighting the recent forest fires that raged through the Black Hills of South Dakota and other western states. The Hotshots are U.S. Forest Service fire crews that specialize in putting out large forest fires. The work is tough, demanding and invaluable. The Hotshot crew is dedicated, spending countless hours training for situations like those faced this summer. Once the fires occur, they often literally work around the clock to save the forests. 
   Nowhere is this spirit more exemplified than by Jared Hohn, a 21-year old college student from Hill City, South Dakota. For the last four summers, Jared has worked as a member of the Hotshot crew, fighting fires all over the country to help put himself through college at the University of South Dakota. As a member of the crew, he often works 16 hour days and, in one instance, worked for 42 hours straight fighting desert fires. 
   The work is dangerous and many lives have been lost. But the 80 hours of training that the crew receives at the start of each summer greatly helps to minimize the danger that they face. The training teaches proper firefighter techniques and understanding of the forces that affect fires, like weather patterns. 
   The dedication to public service and to saving lives is reflected in Jared and the entire Hotshot crew. Jared and the Hotshots are a hard-working group who literally lay their lives on the line to improve the world around us and to protect us from fires. We owe a great deal to them and to the Forest Service for preforming such a valuable public service.

Mr President, I rise today to applaud Senate adoption of legislation I introduced to re-authorize and expand a popular program which provides mediation services between agricultural producers and the various credit and United States Department of Agriculture agencies who family farmers and ranchers work with to maintain their farming and ranching operations. 
   On June 15, 2000, I introduced S. 2741, legislation to re-authorize, expand, and clarify the state agricultural mediation program. Nine Senators cosponsored this legislation, including Senators DASCHLE, ROBERTS, CONRAD, GRASSLEY, KERREY, CRAIG, HARKIN, DORGAN, and LEVIN. I thank these colleagues for their bipartisan support for my bill, which was included as part of the Grain Standards Act adopted by the Senate earlier this week. 
   Extension of this mediation program was adopted with wide bipartisan support in the Senate as part of the Grain Standards Act Reauthorization. The present state agricultural mediation law was set to expire this year, but our reauthorization extends it through 2005. 
   This step was significant because family farmers and ranchers in my state of South Dakota and all across this country continue to suffer from a depressed rural economy and rock-bottom commodity prices. Agriculture is the backbone of our economy, and we must not fail to provide support to our family farmers and ranchers who are coping with these difficult times. 
   During the 1980's farm crisis, Congress approved federal funds and participation in a state-by-state operated farm mediation program. Authorized in the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, this mediation program helps farmers and ranchers, and their creditors, in resolving credit disputes in a confidential and non-adversarial setting, which is outside the traditional process of litigation, appeals, bankruptcy, and foreclosure. The mediators are neutral facilitators and they do not make decisions for the disputing parties. 
   Each year Congress provides funding for state mediation, and these funds are matched with state funds to carry out the mediation program. Currently,  twenty-five states participate in this mediation program, including Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 
   I am pleased we were able to clarify and expand the scope of mediation in this reauthorization. With the support and direction of the Coalition of Agricultural Mediation Programs (CAMP), mediation now clearly can aim to resolve disputes such as wetland determinations, grazing issues, and USDA farm program matters, in addition to the traditional credit role of mediation. CAMP represents the individuals and entities across the nation who administer the state agricultural mediation programs, and I thank that organization for their leadership on this issue. 
   I want to specifically offer my thanks and gratitude to Linda Hodgin, Director of Mediation and Ag Counseling, with the South Dakota Department of Agriculture. Linda's knowledge, input, and ability to work with CAMP enabled Congress to enact the mediation reauthorization this year. Under her direction in the last two years, around 500 family farmers and ranchers in South Dakota have benefitted from the services of mediation and counseling. The mediators and counselors who work with Linda in South Dakota are to be commended for their time and commitment to family farm agriculture. 
   We live in a day and age where nearly every farmer and rancher must secure financing from some source in order to take care of production costs associated with agricultural production. This mediation program allows agricultural producers to settle their credit and farm program disputes in a fair way without digging themselves into legal debt. I wish to thank my colleagues who supported this important initiative.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer sincere thanks and gratitude for the cooperation and leadership demonstrated this year in South Dakota by a large coalition of farm, conservation, wildlife, and environmental groups in my great State. These groups have taken an almost unprecedented step to cooperate in solving a problem concerning the treatment of wetlands in the context of production agriculture in South Dakota. 
   Their cooperation led to the adoption of a pilot project--the Conservation of Farmable Wetland Act of 2000--negotiated through Congress by Senator DASCHLE and me whereby farmed wetlands in a six-state region can become eligible for enrollment in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). 
   When it comes to conservation policy and the federal farm program, many issues are hotly debated. Perhaps nowhere has this become more evident than in the administration and policy implications of managing wetlands on farmground in South Dakota and the entire country. A real battle over the management of farmed wetlands has waged over the years between farmers--who own and farm the productive land where these wetlands are located--and conservation groups--who believe these wetlands should be maintained in their natural state. 
   Earlier this year, over thirty South Dakota groups struck an agreement in principle regarding the treatment of wetlands with some constructive ideas to signify a cease fire of sorts in this battle over the management of wetlands. Their agreement in principle expressed support for financial assistance  for farmers and landowners who voluntarily chose to commit the wetlands on their private lands--primarily land in crop production--to conservation under CRP. The farmable wetlands targeted in their agreement are located in low-lying draws or waterways that run through crop fields and carry runoff and topsoil into creeks and rivers in wet years. In dry years, these wetlands are farmed. Currently, grass filter strips surrounding these farmed wetlands qualify for CRP, but not the actual wetland acreage. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the agreement in principle and name of every group signing the agreement be printed at this point in the RECORD, and that my statement continue in the RECORD at the conclusion of the agreement in principle and list of groups.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, given that over thirty groups and several more individuals were active participants in this historic agreement in South Dakota--it is impossible to aptly recognize every single one that deserves credit for this achievement. However, I cannot overlook the efforts of two real champions of this agreement and pilot project--two individuals who worked closely with me to make sure their idea developed from a South Dakota agreement to a six-state pilot project that the 106th Congress enacted and that the President will sign into law. 
   Paul Shubeck, a Centerville, South Dakota farmer and Carl Madsen, a Brookings, South Dakota private lands coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service developed this plan and helped negotiate its path through Congress. 
   Paul Shubeck greatly impressed me with his ability to shepherd this proposal, not only within a diverse coalition of South Dakota groups who normally do not tend to agree on wetlands matters, but also at the national level where he consistently advocated on behalf of the American family farmer who just wants a chance to produce a crop on his land and protect the environment all at the same time. Paul's drive and ability to compromise were key to the success of our pilot project. 
   Carl Madsen was a real source of passion for this project and provided us with a sense for the big picture--how our pilot would and could work in South Dakota and other parts of the United States. Carl's deep knowledge of wetlands and conservation policy provided us with critical technical assistance to ensure this pilot project was a credible, practical program. 
   Many, many more individuals and groups in South Dakota and the United States provided direct assistance to this effort Mr. President, and I want them all to know I am deeply grateful. 
   Earlier this year Mr. President, Senator DASCHLE and I urged Secretary Dan Glickman and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to implement the South Dakota agreement in principle on an administrative basis. While USDA was supportive of the concept, they were reluctant to implement such a program without a clearer understanding of the purpose and implications of the program. 
   In response, on July 7, I brought a top USDA official to a farm near Renner, South Dakota where we met with several groups and individuals to discuss how to conserve these critical wetlands yet compensate farmers for taking the wetlands out of crop production. It was there that some suggested a pilot project would be the best route to take. Then, on July 27, Senator DASCHLE and I introduced S. 2980 to create a South Dakota pilot project permitting up to 150,000 acres of farmable wetlands into CRP. 
   Once S. 2980 was introduced, national conservation, wildlife, and farm organizations took interest and requested that we expand the pilot to cover more than South Dakota. The proposal adopted by Congress is the result of weeks of negotiations between Senator DASCHLE, myself, USDA, Senator LUGAR who serves as the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and several national groups who now support the pilot. The changes resulted in expanding this program to the Prairie Pothole Region of the United States, including South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Montana. It is limited to 500,000 acres in those states, with an assurance that access be distributed fairly among interested CRP participants. 
   I truly believe this pilot project will provide landowners an alternative to farming these highly sensitive wetlands in order to achieve a number of benefits including; improved water quality, reduced soil erosion, enhanced wildlife habitat, preserved biodiversity, flood control, less wetland drainage, economic compensation for landowners for protecting the sensitive wetlands, and diminished divisiveness over wetlands issues. 
   Moreover, the pilot project is consistent with the purpose of CRP, and, if successful, could serve as a model for future farm policy as we look toward the next farm bill. I believe Congress will be unable to develop a future farm bill without the support of those in the conservation and wildlife community. I am a strong supporter of conservation programs that protect sensitive soil and water resources, promote wildlife habitat, and provide farmers and landowners with benefits and incentives to conserve land. I have introduced the Flex Fallow Farm Bill Amendment to achieve some of these objectives. It is my hope that the success on our pilot project can serve as a model to once again bring conservation groups together with farm interests in order to develop a well-balanced approach to future farm policy that protects our resources while promoting family-farm agriculture. 
   Finally, I fully understand the successful adoption of this wetlands pilot project--no matter how important--will not put an end to the ongoing debate over the management of wetlands on farmland. Yet, I really hope that everyone engaged in the debate considers how effective we can be when we cooperate and compromise on this important issue.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to publicly commend Lincoln McIlravy, a native of Phillip, SD, on earning a bronze medal for his remarkable display of athleticism in the freestyle wrestling event at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. 
   Lincoln McIlravy's wrestling talent combined with years of practice, and  an extraordinary dedication to physical excellence attribute to his athletic success. On October 1, 2000, Lincoln became one of America's best wrestlers on the global Olympiad stage where he scored a solid 3-1 victory over Sergei Demtchenko of Belarus, thus victoriously claiming the bronze medal in the 69kg freestyle event. 
   Success has been abundant in Lincoln's wrestling career, as his honors include being a three-time NCAA champion for the University of Iowa, as well as four U.S. National titles, 1997-2000. Yet, Lincoln's prominence as an international contender began when he was a member of the 1997 World team. McIlravy then became a two-time world medalist having won a silver medal at the 1999 World Championships and a bronze medal in the 1998 World Championships. He not only was a 1999 Pan American Games champion, but also a 1998 Goodwill Games champion, in addition to the three-time World Cup champion, 1998-2000. 
   Lincoln McIlravy is an exemplary athlete who richly deserves this distinguished recognition. Therefore, it is with great honor that I share Lincoln's impressive Olympic accomplishments with my colleagues.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, last week, the Senate passed a conference report which contained the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, the legislative branch appropriations bill, and a repeal of the century-old telephone excise tax. This package was the first of the several ``mini-omnibus'' packages we will likely consider in the waning days of this Congress, and unfortunately, it demonstrates the fundamental problems associated with this type of legislating. 
   I voted against this mini-omnibus for several reasons. The Senate never had the opportunity to even consider the Treasury-Postal bill on the floor. Many issues that are critical to Senators could not receive deliberation because of the unwillingness of the leaders to allow the Senate to fulfill its constitutional directive of deliberating on the crucial issues facing the nation. I will not review the entire list of neglected issues again. That recitation has occurred elsewhere, and I am confident we will hear more about them in the coming days. 
   Suffice it to say, I deplore the procedure that permits unpassed appropriations bills to go right to conference. Other than the procedural irregularity, I opposed this conference report because it did not contain language to strike the congressional pay raise. It is unfathomable to me that at a time we cannot raise the minimum wage to bring a full-time worker above the poverty line, we once again raise salaries for Members of Congress. I have opposed any effort to raise congressional salaries in every year since 1994. I, and similarly-minded colleagues, were denied the opportunity to fully debate this issue. I cannot support this increase, especially under the current  circumstances with so much unfinished business. 
   Unfortunately, many initiatives I support were also included in this package. Among them is the repeal of the telephone excise tax, a revenue used originally to help fund the Spanish-American war. This three percent surcharge is among the most regressive taxes, and I was proud to be an early cosponsor of the effort to repeal it. In addition to cosponsoring the original legislation, I voted to repeal this tax when the repeal was offered as an amendment to the estate tax repeal. 
   In a time of unprecedented surpluses, we must fix some of the inequities in the tax code. I am disappointed we have not managed to accomplish more. Once again, this is indicative of the overly partisan nature of Senate activity, and this partisanship has blocked fair tax reform. Nonetheless, I am pleased we have at least resolved the federal telephone excise tax, a reform which will save all Americans $51 billion over the next decade. I commend the major telephone providers for committing to pass fully these savings to consumers, and I once again regret that the unique and deplorable manner in which this Congress is fulfilling its responsibilities forced me to vote against this package.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased the President recently signed into law the Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act. As you know, Senator JON KYL and I introduced last year a bill to require Federal prisoners to pay a nominal fee when they initiate certain visits for medical attention. Fees collected from prisoners will either be paid as restitution to victims or be deposited into the Federal Crime Victims' Fund. My State of South Dakota is one of 38 States that have implemented State-wide prisoner health care copayment programs. The Department of Justice supported extending this prisoner health care copayment program to Federal prisoners in an attempt to reduce unnecessary medical procedures and ensure that adequate health care services are available for prisoners who need them. 
   My interest in the prisoner health care copayment issue came from discussions I had in South Dakota with a number of law enforcement officials and US Marshal Lyle Swenson about the equitable treatment between pre-sentencing Federal prisoners housed in county jails and the county prisoners residing in those same facilities. Currently, county prisoners in South Dakota are subject to State and local laws allowing the collection of a health care copayment, while Marshals Service prisoners are not, thereby allowing Federal prisoners to abuse health care  resources at great cost to state and local law enforcement. 
   As our legislation moved through the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate last year, we had the opportunity to work on specific concerns raised by South Dakota law enforcement officials and the US Marshals Service. I sincerely appreciate Senator KYL's willingness to incorporate my language into the Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act that allows state and local facilities to collect health care copayment fees when housing pre-sentencing federal prisoners. 
   I also worked with Senator KYL and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to include sufficient flexibility in the Kyl-Johnson bill for the Bureau of Prisons and local facilities contracting with the Marshals Service to maintain preventive-health priorities. The Kyl-Johnson bill prohibits the refusal of treatment for financial reasons or for appropriate preventive care. I am pleased this provision was included to pre-empt long term, and subsequently more costly, health problems among prisoners. 
   The goal of the Kyl-Johnson Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act is not about generating revenue for the Federal, State, and local prison systems. Instead, current prisoner health care copayment programs in 38 States illustrate the success in reducing the number of frivolous health visits and strain on valuable health care resources. The Kyl-Johnson bill will ensure that adequate health care is available to those prisoners who need it, without straining the budgets of taxpayers.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Congress and the President on the recent enactment of S. 2420, the bill to provide long-term healthcare insurance for federal employees. As the nation's largest employer, we have set an example for the private sector in establishing a long-term care insurance program for federal workers and retirees. At least thirteen million people are expected to benefit from this far-sighted effort, but there is more work to be done on those issues affecting current and former Federal employees. Today, I wish to highlight three proposals on which I have received much correspondence from my constituents: repeal of the Government Pension Offset, GPO, elimination of the Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision, WEP; and, health insurance premium conversion availability. 
   I am a cosponsor of S. 717, Senator MIKULSKI's proposal to reform the GPO. Additionally, I am a supporter of initiatives in the House of Representatives to eliminate the WEP. Both pieces of legislation alleviate current laws that block Federal annuitants and their spouses from collecting full Social Security benefits. Because of the current budget rules requiring the offsetting of spending cuts or tax increases, passage of these reforms have been complicated. 
   We should not penalize people who have worked hard and contributed to the country simply because they worked for the Federal government and receive a Federal pension. This Senate must consider these bills a priority, and seriously review the offsets necessary to achieve these essential and fair changes. I believe that we need to enforce a budget discipline which will balance the budget without borrowing payroll tax dollars from the Social Security trust fund and any other federal trust funds. However, now that the budget is balanced, we should first restore the change that helped bring us toward fiscal soundness. 
   Finally, I wish to address the availability of health insurance premium conversion arrangements. As my colleagues may be aware, no Senate legislation has been introduced, but H.R. 4277 has been introduced in the House. Under the provisions of this bill, the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, would be directed to take necessary measures to ensure that enrollees have the option to paying charges out of pre-tax earnings. This would ensure equal premium tax treatment for federal workers and retirees. I urge my House and Senate colleagues to provide full consideration to this legislation, and bring Federal employees and retirees pay and benefit equity and fairness. 
   Mr. President, these are just three issues of concern to me and my constituents. While enactment of the long-term care bill was a great step forward, I must reiterate my call for more work to be done. I am hopeful that we may make a serious effort on this legislation on the few remaining days of the 106th Congress. These concerns will not go away, and I know we will surely be hearing about the GPO, WEP, and premium conversion in the next Congress is we do not take action this year.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will vote today on the fiscal year 2001 Department of Defense Authorization Conference Report. This defense bill contains historic improvements in health care coverage for the approximately 12,600 military retirees, their families, and survivors currently living in South Dakota. In addition, the defense bill contains much-needed quality of life'' improvements for men and women in active duty and several improvements to the TRICARE health care system for active duty personnel and their families. 
   On the first day of this legislative session, I introduced the Keep Our Promises to America's Military Retirees Act to restore the broken promise of lifetime health care for military retirees and their dependents. Men and women were promised lifetime health care for themselves and their families upon completion of 20 years in the military. However, military retirees are currently kicked out of TRICARE once they become eligible for Medicare. The current situation breaks a promise our country has made with its veterans and military retirees. The lack of adequate health care coverage for military retirees also impacts retention of qualified military personnel and sends a negative signal to young men and women considering a career in the military. 
   My bipartisan legislation received the endorsement from military retiree and veterans organizations as well as from a grassroots organization of thousands of military retirees across the country. My legislation called for military retirees to have the option of staying in their TRICARE military health care program or electing to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, FEHBP. The Keep Our Promises to America's Military Retirees Act would also allow military retirees who entered the military prior to June 7, 1956 (the date military health care for retirees was enacted into law) to enroll in FEHBP with the United States paying 100 percent of the costs. 
   I offered my legislation as an amendment during Senate consideration of the fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization bill. Although the amendment failed on a procedural motion, I was pleased that Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman JOHN WARNER agreed to include one part of my bill--the expansion of TRICARE to Medicare-eligible military retirees--in both the Senate defense bill and the final conference report that will be sent to the President. 
   The conference report also extends full DoD pharmacy benefits for Medicare-eligible military retirees. Military retirees will now be able to use DoD retail and mail-order pharmacy programs. A 20 percent copayment is required for retail, and a $8 copay is required for a 90-day supply of mail-ordered drugs. As you recall, this pharmacy provision was included in the Senate defense bill after I was successful in creating a special military retiree health care reserve fund'' in the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution. 
   The fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization Conference Report includes a number of other health care and ``quality of life'' improvements for men and women in active duty and their families. I am pleased this bill eliminates TRICARE Prime copayments for active-duty family members as well as increasing reimbursement rates for TRICARE providers. In my numerous meetings in the state on TRICARE, low reimbursement rates have been of particular concern because the low rates make recruitment of TRICARE health care providers in rural areas difficult. With my support, the bill also includes efforts to improve TRICARE through good business practices, increased technology, and reduced administrative waste. 
   The conference report includes a much-deserved 3.7 percent pay raise for active duty and reserve personnel. I am pleased the bill also begins the process of eliminating the mandatory out-of-pocket housing costs incurred by servicemembers. Recruitment and retention efforts will be enhanced with incentives to join ROTC and increased enlistment bonuses, as well as a provision that allows VEAP conversion to the Montgomery GI Bill for servicemembers currently on active duty who had previously contributed to VEAP. 
   While I am pleased that a number of health care issues have been addressed in this year's defense authorization bill, there is more work that needs to be done. I will continue to work with cosponsors of my Keep Our Promises legislation to provide military retirees with the option of using FEHBP and to address the broken promise of free lifetime health care to those military personnel who entered the military prior to June 7, 1956. I am also disappointed that the bill failed to adequately address a rule that prohibits disabled vets from receiving their retired pay and disability compensation concurrently. I am a cosponsor of legislation that would correct this injustice, and I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure its eventual passage. Finally, I will continue to fight for increased veterans education benefits through a strengthened Montgomery GI Bill and passage of my Veterans Education Opportunities Act. 
   The health care improvements and ``quality of life'' improvements included in this year's defense authorization bill are a testament to the hard work and grassroots organization of thousands of military retirees across the country. One particular military retiree, Fred Athans from Rapid City, recently completed his term as national president of The Retired Enlisted Association. Fred and countless others from South Dakota and around the country were essential in the passage of this legislation.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to request that the provisions of Title III of H.R. 701, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act be included in the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations conference report. The Interior Appropriations conference report passed last week included increased funding for land, water and wildlife conservation programs. While the bill is a positive first step towards providing permanent funding for these programs, I would have preferred to see enactment of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, CARA, especially the wildlife conservation provisions in Title III of the bill. To this end, I am requesting that Title III of H.R. 701 be included in the conference report of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. I was a strong supporter of CARA when it was reported out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, of which I am a member. It is the most important conservation and wildlife measure that Congress has written in the last 50 years. In particular, I am very pleased with Title III of the bill, which addresses wildlife conservation. I was actively involved early in the process and worked with the Committee to see that the wildlife provisions were included in the final product. 
   Title III would provide funding for a diverse array of fish and wildlife species, with an emphasis on preventing species, both game and non-game, from becoming endangered. These goals would be achieved by conserving important wildlife habitat, funding wildlife inventories to design better management plans, and working cooperatively with private landowners in a non-regulatory, incentive-based manner. Moreover, it gives the States the flexibility to set their own goals to meet their needs in a way that works for them. In addition, the emphasis on preventing species from becoming endangered will go a long way to help private property owners. Addressing concerns for endangered species on their lands is a costly process. Preventing species now from becoming endangered later is an investment that will save landowners valuable time and money that would occur after the species have been depleted. In addition, CARA will make it easier on hunters and anglers---more than 90 percent of all State fish and wildlife agency funding is from user fees. The passage of Title III and of CARA would create more equity in funding preservation efforts. 
   I am concerned that the language in the Interior bill, while providing funding for a new wildlife conservation fund'' does not provide enough funding for the States to meet their needs and leaves discretion to the Fish and Wildlife Service without giving States the proper flexibility to administer the programs. Wildlife conservation efforts have been chronically underfunded over the years. Including Title III of CARA would help to guarantee that sufficient resources are available so that States and the Nation can meet these important needs.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr President, I rise today in support of the Daschle-Johnson resolution that commends the men and women who valiantly fought the Jasper fire in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The fire that raged through the Black Hills caused considerable damage to the forests in these states. Almost 100,000 acres burned in the Black Hills alone. To the great relief of all of us in South Dakota, the fire has been brought under control. The firefighters in our state did a tremendous job in containing the fire. Their efforts have been nothing short of Herculean. 
   The fire started near Jasper Cave on the Black Hills National Forest on August 24, 2000 and was contained by September 8, 2000. By the second day, the fire had quadrupled in size and was burning as fast as 100 acres per second. The fire threatened private homes in the communities of Deerfield, Custer and Hill City, the Jewel Cave National Monument and the Mount Rushmore National Memorial. It also forced the evacuation of many residents on northwestern Custer County and southwestern Pennington County. 
   1,160 men and women worked around the clock, most of them volunteers who literally risked their lives and made great sacrifices to contain the fire. Special mention should be made of the Tatanka Hotshot crew, an elite 20-person firefighting team based in the Black Hills who came from fighting fires in western Wyoming the fight the Jasper fire. While the Tatanka crew has fought several fires throughout the country, this was the first major fire they fought in their home forest . 
   The firefighters were incredibly successful. In spite of the rugged terrain and the intense speed and size of the Jasper fire, it was contained with only one home lost and with no injuries to any firefighters or local citizens. This resolution commends the firefighters for their bravery, their extraordinary efforts to contain the fire, and their  commitment to protect lives, property and the surrounding communities. Senator DASCHLE, myself, and the entire Senate are proud of their efforts. We can't thank them enough.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate today will vote on legislation to reauthorize the landmark Violence Against Women Act. The legislation is part of a larger bill that also helps end the trafficking of women and children into international sex trades, slavery, and forced labor.  This bill passed the House of Representatives last week, and I am confident the President will sign it into law. 
   I have been involved in the campaign to end domestic violence in our communities dating back to 1983 when I introduced legislation in the South Dakota State Legislature to use marriage license fees to help fund domestic abuse shelters. At that time, thousands of South Dakota women and children were in need of shelters and programs to help them. However, few people wanted to acknowledge that domestic abuse occurred in their communities, or even their own homes. 
   In 1994, as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, I helped get the original Violence Against Women Act passed into law. Since the passage of this important bill, South Dakota has received over $8 million in funding for battered women's shelters and family violence prevention and services. Nationwide, the Violence Against Women Act has provided over $1.9 billion toward domestic abuse prevention and victims' services. 
   In South Dakota alone, approximately 15,000 victims of domestic violence were provided assistance last year, and over 40 domestic violence shelters and outreach centers in the state received funding through the Violence Against Women Act. Shelters, victims' service providers, and counseling centers in South Dakota rely heavily on these funds to provide assistance to these women and children. Some of these examples include: 
   The Mitchell Area Safehouse started the first Family Visitation Center in the state with these funds. The center ensures that children receive safe and monitored visits with their parents when violence has been a factor in their home environment. Now there are 9 such centers in the state. 
   The Winner Resource Center for Families received funding to provide emergency shelter, counseling services, rent assistance, and clothing to women and children in south-central South Dakota. 
   Violence Against Women Act funding has also allowed Minnehaha County and Pennington County to hire domestic court liaisons to assist with the Protection Order process. 
   In Rapid City, Violence Against Women Act funding also allowed Working Against Violence Inc. (WAVI) to develop a Sexual Assault Program and provide specialized crisis intervention and follow-up for child and adult survivors of rape. 
   On the Crow Creek reservation, Violence Against Women Act funding helped the tribal justice system to develop stalking, sexual assault, and sexual harassment tribal codes. Similar efforts have been realized on the Rosebud and Sisseton-Wahpeton reservations through this program. 
   The original Violence Against Women Act expired last Saturday, October 1, and I once again led the fight in the Senate this year to reauthorize this legislation. The bill that the Senate will vote on today authorizes over $3 billion for domestic abuse prevention programs. I am especially pleased that the bill includes a provision I supported that targets $40 million a year in funding for rural areas. 
   The National Domestic Violence Hotline is also reauthorized in this legislation. As you know, this hotline has received 500,000 calls from women and children in danger from abuse since its creation in 1994. The hotline's number is 1-800-799-SAFE, and I encourage any woman or child who is in an abusive environment to call for help. 
   The original Violence Against Women Act increased penalties for repeat sex offenders, established mandatory restitution to victims of domestic violence, codified much of our existing laws on rape, and strengthened interstate enforcement of violent crimes against women. I am pleased to support efforts this year that strengthen these laws, expand them to include stalking on the internet and via the mail, and extend them to our schools and college campuses. 
   Passage of the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization bill is another important step in the campaign against domestic violence. While I am pleased that this historic legislation will soon be on its way to the President for his signature, the fact remains that domestic violence remains a reality for too many women and children in our country and in South Dakota. I will continue to do all that I can, as a member of the United States Senate and a concerned citizen of South Dakota, to help victims of domestic violence and work to prevent abuse in the first place.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and I can think of no better way to start off the month than by reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and providing thousands of South Dakota women and children with the resources and protection from violence and abuse. 
   As you know, programs contained in the Violence Against Women Act expired October 1. I have sponsored legislation to reauthorize and expand these important programs, and the reauthorization bill has received broad, bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. In fact, there are 72 Senators cosponsoring my bill. Also, the House of Representatives voted last week by an overwhelming 415-3 margin to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. 
   This Congress, that has failed to act on several important legislative initiatives, has the opportunity to do something right this week. Majority Leader LOTT can schedule votes today on reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, and it would pass overwhelmingly. The President has promised to sign the bill as soon as possible. The time to act is now. 
   In South Dakota alone, approximately 15,000 victims of domestic violence were provided assistance last year. Shelters, victims' service providers, and counseling centers in South Dakota rely heavily on these funds to provide assistance to these women and children. Reauthorization of this legislation assures that South Dakota communities will continue to have access to critical funds for domestic violence services. 
   A woman from South Dakota recently wrote me about this issue, and I shared her story on the Senate floor last week because I believe it made the most compelling case for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. This South Dakotan was abused as a child, raped as a teenager, and emotionally abused as a wife. Her grandchildren were also abused. In her letter, she pleads: Please reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Don't let another woman go through what I went through, and please don't let another child go through what my grandchildren have gone through. You can make a difference.'' 
   I also heard from a Rural Outreach Advocate in South Dakota who said a grant from the Violence Against Women Act enables her and other advocates to help battered women in our state. She noted that many assaulted women and children in our state live in remote, rural areas that don't have available services. Without grants from the Violence Against Women Act, this Rural Outreach Advocate warned that we will be unable to help a majority of battered women and children on our state's farms and in our state's small towns. 
   In addition to the need to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, I recently joined Senator PAUL WELLSTONE of Minnesota in introducing legislation called the National Domestic Violence Hotline Enhancement Act. Since 1994, the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-SAFE) has received 500,000 calls from women and children in danger from abuse. My legislation would create the National First Call for Safety web site that would allow National Domestic Violence Hotline operators to quickly and easily find the most appropriate shelter for callers. The highly secure and confidential web site would keep a continuously updated, nationwide list of available shelters and information about services and facilities offered by these shelters. 
   My legislation is modeled after the successful Day One program in Minnesota. Day One has run a web site linking every shelter in Minnesota and reports that 99 percent of women and children who call are assured to receive shelters and services that meet their needs. 
   While there are many worthwhile issues that must be addressed by this Congress in the next few weeks, I can think of no better accomplishment for Congress than to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and pass my National Domestic Violence Hotline Enhancement Act. Simply put, these laws will help keep wives, daughters, sisters, and friends from becoming victims of domestic violence.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend Shirley Ragsdale, the editor for the Sioux Falls, South Dakota Argus Leader newspaper, on her receiving the national Casey Journalism Center Awards 2000 Casey Medals for her outstanding coverage of the plight of South Dakota's children in the Juvenile Corrections facilities. 
   The Casey Medals for Meritorious Journalism honor distinguished coverage of disadvantaged children and family, and the institutions and agencies charged with serving them. The Casey Journalism Center serves as an independent national resource center for professional journalists and it is operated by the University of Maryland and funded by the Annie E. Casey Foundation. 
   Shirley Ragsdale is a talented journalist, an advocate of children's rights, and a dedicated citizen of South Dakota. This honorable award is a reflection of her extraordinary talent, creativity, and ability to convey depth and originality supported by thorough research and consistent documentation. Her unremitting and well-reasoned editorials pressed for changes in the unacceptable practices, as indicated by substantiated reports of abuse, occurring within the South Dakota juvenile correction system. 
   Shirley Ragsdale truly deserves this prestigous award. It is an honor for me to share her impressive achievements with my colleagues and to commend her on her journalistic success.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for initiatives to create a federal-state-local partnership relative to public school construction and renovation throughout America. At a time when unprecedented budget surpluses are being projected by budget leaders at both the White House and in Congress, it seems clear to me that some modest portion of these funds ought to be used to assist our school districts. In South Dakota, it has become increasingly difficult to pass school bond issues, given the fact that real estate taxes are already too high and our state's agricultural economy has been struggling. The result is an enormous backlog of school construction needs, and the costs of repair and replacement only increase with each passing year. 
   To propose a new school construction partnership is not to suggest some sort of ``federalization'' of K-12 public education. The decisions as to whether to replace or repair a school would remain with the local school districts where they belong, and by far the largest share of the expense would continue to be met by local taxpayers. Even so, a federal effort to reduce interest costs or otherwise participate in reducing the total cost of school construction could often times make the difference between a successful project or none at all. If the federal government were to simply block grant these funds, the dollars would have to be disbursed in such a broad manner that no school district would receive a sufficient amount of help to seriously make a real difference. 
   While I appreciate that school construction assistance must be targeted to help needy school districts first, I do want to convey my strong opinion that the eligibility requirements for a federal-local partnership should not be so restrictive as to eliminate the possibility of many of our school districts from participating. South Dakota has a great many school districts which are not completely impoverished, but yet find it almost impossible to pass a bond issue and otherwise adequately fund their education programs. This program should apply to more than just the extreme poverty situations of inner urban areas and remote rural areas. It should apply as well to the many small and medium size communities all across our country that seriously struggle with school construction and renovation needs. 
   I applaud and support these efforts to invest a small portion of our Nation's wealth in improved educational opportunities and facilities for all--this investment now, will result in improved academic performance, better citizenship and a stronger economy for generations to come.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise today to congratulate KELO-LAND TV of Sioux Falls, South Dakota for receiving the prestigious national Emmy award for it's Tradition of Caring'' public service announcement. 
   The Emmy awards nobly serve as a gateway to focusing the public's attention on cultural, educational, and technological advances in the television industry. Specifically, the purpose of the award for the Public Service Announcement--Campaign category is to recognize special achievements of the television media establishment based on their unmatched ability to achieve excellence and originality. Within this  category, the outstanding achievements KELO-TV made in it's ``Tradition of Caring'' public service announcement led them to be chosen as first among four national finalists at the presentation of the Emmy awards in New York City. 
   The ``Tradition of Caring'' public service announcement culminates three outstanding years of active community involvement by all of KELO-LAND TV's employees on behalf of over twenty charitable organizations. The purpose of their public service campaign was to facilitate employee and community involvement in local causes. To effectively implement their campaign, employees were divided into teams based on similar interests with each team focusing on a particular organization within the community. Their personal approach to public service has not only won them an Emmy, but it has significantly helped organizations throughout South Dakota gain positive exposure and financial assistance. 
   KELO-LAND TV richly deserves this distinguished award. It is an honor for me to share with my colleagues KELO-TV's exemplary leadership and strong commitment to both the development and enhancement of South Dakota's local communities through public service. I strongly commend their advancements in the television industry, and I am very pleased that their substantial efforts have found such extraordinary success.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on September 28, 2000, the United States Senate unanimously approved legislation to provide private relief for Frances Schochenmaier of Bonesteel, South Dakota. Frances' case clearly warrants action by the United States Congress to correct an injustice inflicted upon her family over 50 years ago. I am pleased that the Senate has taken this important step by passing the Private Relief Bill for Frances Schochenmaier, which I was proud to have introduced and was cosponsored by my friend and colleague from South Dakota Senator TOM DASCHLE. I will continue to work diligently with Members of the House of Representatives to ensure the legislation is passed before the end of this Congressional session and signed by the President. 
   Frances' husband, Hermann Schochenmaier, was one of the thousands of young men who valiantly answered his country's call to duty during World War II. While serving in Europe, Hermann was wounded--shot in the arm in what medical personnel referred to as a through-and-through'' wound. Upon returning home, the Department of Veterans Affairs awarded Hermann a 10 percent disability rating. For 50 years, Hermann received disability compensation for the injury he received during his service in the United States military. Then, in 1995,  the Department of Veterans Affairs acknowledged that it was ``clearly and unmistakably erroneous'' in rating Hermann's injury too low. Instead of a 10 percent rating, Hermann's injuries during World War II were consistent with a 30 percent disability rating. 
   Over these 50 years, Hermann received approximately $10,000, when he should have actually received closer to $70,000. Unfortunately, only one week prior to the Department of Veterans Affairs correcting this problem, Hermann Schochenmaier passed away. To further complicate matters, the Department of Veterans Affairs refused to give Hermann's family the disability benefits he rightfully earned. 
   For the past five years, I have worked with Frances to exhaust every avenue within the Department of Veterans Affairs. The answer was always the same: the law does not allow for veterans' widows to receive these lost benefits. So, I decided that it must take an act of Congress--literally--to ensure that a veteran's widow from Bonesteel received the benefits her husband earned, but was denied from receiving in his lifetime. 
   Thanks to the perseverance from members of my office, the continued faith of Frances and her family, and some bipartisanship among members of Congress, we were able to pass this important legislation in the Senate and put it on a track to be signed into law by the President before the end of this year. 
   My wife, Barbara, and I are parents of a son who serves our country in the Army, and we know the sacrifices families make when their loved-ones travel overseas in the military. I am sorry that fate denied Hermann the opportunity to see justice done with the correction of his disability rating. I am thankful that fate and old-fashioned elbow-grease over these past five years has given our country the opportunity to make things right with Frances and the Schochenmaier family.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. I must say, I commend my colleague from West Virginia, Senator BYRD, for his suggestion that some of us come to the floor today to talk a little bit about the process. 
   Some people would say it is a procedural issue. It is far more profound than simply a procedural issue in the context of the way we have handled legislation on the Senate floor this year. The process that has been applied not only does, I believe, great damage to this institution, but, in the end, it has great consequence to the substance of our legislative priorities and certainly of the budget for our Nation. 
   Two out of the 13 appropriations bills that are required to run the Federal Government have been passed. Eleven remain incomplete. October 1 is the beginning of the Federal fiscal year, and yet we have made little progress on the Federal budget. We have a CR, continuing resolution, that will take us to October 6. But, clearly, we are in a state of chaos right now relative to the completion of our work in the Senate. 
   This year has been the shortest legislative session in the Senate since the ``do-nothing'' Congress that President Truman campaigned against. As my colleague from North Dakota alluded to, during the entire course of this year, we have been in session and have had votes in all of 3 weeks out of the year. How many of our constituents can imagine employment or service of any kind that would involve 3 full weeks out of the year? Of those 115 days we have been in session, roughly 30 percent of them have involved no votes whatever. No progress has been made relative to the completion of the people's agenda. 
   Now we find, I think most profoundly objectionable of all, an appropriations process where appropriations bills which deal with the Federal budget but, more importantly, deal with where our priorities are as a people--whether we are going to invest more money in education, in health care, in Medicare, in the environment, in our national defense, towards debt reduction--these are all the issues that need to be resolved in the context of the appropriations debate. Yet we find now that these bills move in an unprecedented fashion from an appropriations committee directly to conference, with no consideration on the Senate floor whatever. 
   It has never been done this way, this kind of legislative bypass of the legislative process, in the Senate. 
   Fully half of the Senators in this body, 25 States, have no representation on the Appropriations Committee. Certainly that is the case for my home State of South Dakota. Those States have no input, no opportunity to speak for their constituents about the nature of these appropriations bills and the kind of priority they apply to our Nation's needs. These bills then go to conference. What is worse, all too often then the conference committees in turn have not met, but only the majority party members agree then to send the bill back to the floor in a conference report, which is unamendable. So we have not even the distilling of thought through the conference committee process. 
   This is a terrible process, one that brings a significantly demeaning quality to the thoughtfulness that ought to be going into these fundamental questions. 
   Eight years after President Clinton was elected to office, having inherited $300 billion a year in red ink, we find ourselves now running budget surpluses. In fact, the White House and the congressional budget experts project budget surpluses in excess of $4 trillion over the coming 10 years. We ought to be cautious about those projections. They are only projections. Most of the money would materialize only in the outer years. Even so, that is a remarkable turnaround. It creates for us a once-in-a-lifetime, a once-in-multiple-generations opportunity to focus on what kind of society America will be for years to come.  
   If we take the surplus and then set aside the trust fund dollars--Social Security and the other trust funds as well--it is projected that we will have a budget surplus of around $1.2 trillion over the coming 10 years. Unfortunately, our colleagues in the House and the Senate, over my objections and over the objections of Senator DASCHLE and most Members on our side, have passed tax cuts that would cost $1.7 trillion over 10 years, when we have only $1.2 trillion to spend before we even get to issues about whether we are going to do anything to improve the quality of education, Medicare, health care, debt reduction, veterans programs, agriculture, the environment, and whatever other needs our Nation might have. 
   Wisely, the President has vetoed the two most expensive tax bills. We can bring them up again in a bipartisan fashion and in a more thoughtful manner. We can address those issues as well as questions of paying down the debt, questions of education and health care, rebuilding our schools, technology that we need, and the strength of our national defense. 
   We cannot bring these issues up and consider them in a thoughtful, deliberative fashion if these issues bypass the Senate floor. That is what the process now entails. This a perversion of our democracy. This is not what the founders of our Republic designed. It does grave injustice not only to this institution but to the needs of every citizen of this Nation. 
   I applaud the work of Senator BYRD, who is an extraordinary scholar, who has a great understanding of the traditions of this body, and who understands our democracy as well as anyone who has served in this body. I appreciate his suggestion that we come to the floor and talk about how our democracy is being demeaned by this process, that, in fact, the kinds of thoughtful, deliberative priority-making decisions all of our people ought to be engaged in are being denied as these bills go directly from the Budget and Appropriations Committees, with no opportunity for amendment, no opportunity for discussion, into conference committees, which are then unamendable. We wind up 
   with the chaos that we have today, with only 2 of the 13 appropriations bills having been passed, as we near October 1, the beginning of the Federal fiscal year, and we find ourselves in a state of legislative chaos as we end this month of September. 
   The people of this country deserve better. We need to work in a bipartisan fashion to bring these bills up in an orderly way and to allow amendments and debate, as was designed for this institution. To see that lost is something in which we can take no pride. It is a shameful circumstance in which we find ourselves in this body, that this would ever have occurred in our democracy. It has never happened before to this scope. 
   It is my hope we learn some painful lessons from the experiences we are having this year. The issues before us are too profound. They are too significant relative to whether we will at last use some resources to pay down the debt, keep the cost of money down, and sustain a strong economy, while at the same time reserving some financial resources to rebuild schools, to do what we need to do to live up to our commitments to veterans, to have a strong national security, to improve our environment, to strengthen Medicare, and to do something about prescription drugs. These are the issues we are being denied an opportunity to debate, to vote on, and to arrive at the kind of political compromises necessary for all of our needs and all of our priorities and all of our points of view to be truly represented in this country. Hopefully, these are lessons that are painfully learned, lessons that will never have to be repeated in future years. 
   This is a sad day to look back at the lack of progress that has been made in this 2nd session of the 106th Congress. This Senate has been denied its ability to truly do its work. The people of America, not the Senators, are the great losers by the process that has been applied to the appropriations process and the legislative process in general this year. 
   I will do all I can to work in a bipartisan fashion to never allow this kind of process to occur again. The people of our Nation deserve far better. If we are going to play the leading role in the world, both economically and in terms of security, we need an institution that works better than that. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend Nelson Lagendyk of Avon, South Dakota on being inducted into the South Dakota Aviation Hall of Fame Combat Wing for his contributions to both state and national aviation. 
   Mr. Lagendyk enlisted in the Air Force in June 1941 where he became a squadron clerk and joined the all volunteer glider program. His outstanding aviation skills led to his promotion to staff sergeant and a transfer to Lubbock, Texas for glider combat training. Once in Texas, Nelson was again promoted, this time to the position of Flight Officer. Following his new promotion, he then traveled to Louisville, Kentucky for continued training in preparation of his flight to Europe. 
   Leadership, courage and honor define Nelson's heroic actions on June 6, 1944 when he joined 4,000 glider and tow planes for a dangerous flight into Hitler's occupied France. Nelson Lagendyk courageously risked his life to secure the airfield behind enemy lines, so that German prisoners may be transported to England where they would later be held accountable for the grave atrocities committed against the Jewish people under Hitler's infamous reign. 
   Nelson's honors for his exemplary service include the distinguished Air Medal and the prestigous Battle Field Commission to 2nd Lieutenant, as well as the Normandy Medal of the Jubilee of Liberty'', which was presented to him by the French government in appreciation for the World War II liberation. Upon his retirement with the rank of General, Nelson enlisted in the Air Force Reserves as a ready reservist. He presently serves as South Dakota's Commander of the World War II Glider Pilot Association. 
   Mr. President, Nelson Lagendyk richly deserves this noble distinction. It is an honor for me to share his heroic accomplishments with my colleagues and to publicly commend him for serving South Dakota and our country valiantly.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to speak about the importance of reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act before September 30. Since enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, the number of forcible rapes of women have declined, and the number of sexual assaults nationwide have gone down as well. 
   Despite the success of the Violence Against Women, Act, domestic abuse and violence against women continue to plague our communities. Consider the fact that a woman is raped every five minutes in this country, and that nearly one in every three adult women experiences at least one physical assault by a partner during adulthood. In fact, more women are injured by domestic violence each year than by automobile accidents and cancer deaths combined. 
   In South Dakota alone, approximately 15,000 victims of domestic violence were provided assistance last year. Shelters, victims' service providers, and counseling centers in my state rely heavily on VAWA funds to provide assistance to these women and children. VAWA reauthorization assures that states and communities will continue to have access to critical funds for domestic violence services. We must not allow this opportunity to pass us by. 
   As you know, legislation to reauthorize VAWA has received broad, bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. I am pleased to join 68 of my Senate colleagues in cosponsoring VAWA legislation that unanimously passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in June. Similar legislation in the House has 233 bipartisan cosponsors and was also approved in June by the House Judiciary Committee. 
   Since the Violence Against Women Act became law, South Dakota organizations have received over $6.7 million in federal funding for domestic abuse programs. In addition, the Violence Against Women Act doubled prison time for repeat sex offenders; established mandatory restitution to victims of violence against women; codified much of our existing laws on rape; and strengthened interstate enforcement of violent crimes against women. 
   The law also created a national toll-free hotline to provide women with crisis intervention help, information about violence against women, and free referrals to local services. Last year, the hotline took its 300,000th call. The number for women to call for help is: 1-800-799-SAFE. 
   In addition to reauthorizing the provisions of the original Violence Against Women Act, the legislation that I am supporting would improve our overall efforts to reduce violence against women by strengthening law enforcement's role in reducing violence against women. The legislation also expands legal services and assistance to victims of violence, while also addressing the effects of domestic violence on children. Finally, programs are funded to strengthen education and training to combat violence against women. 
   A woman from South Dakota recently wrote me about this issue, and I'd like to share her story with you because I believe it makes the most compelling case for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. 
   The letter begins:  
   My story is that I was abused as a child, raped as a teenager, and emotionally abused as a wife. I survived that, but I almost didn't emotionally survive the last two and a half years knowing that my grandchildren were being abused and having my hands tied to be patient while our laws worked. My son has been fighting for custody of his triplets.  
   The letter continues:  
   Their story is horrible. While in the custody of their mother and her live-in boyfriend, they were battered, bruised, emotionally and sexually assaulted.  
   She writes that one of her grandchildren got her ear cut off, another had his head split open, and the third child's throat was slit. 
   Thankfully, the woman writes that her son finally got custody of her grandchildren and removed them from the abusive environment. 
   The letter concludes:  
   This is my story, and at least it has a happy ending, but there are hundreds of women and children out there still living in danger. Please reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Don't let another woman go through what I went through, and please don't let another child go through what my grandchildren have gone through. You can make a difference.  
   Simply stated, reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act will provide much needed resources to prevent domestic violence in our country. I appreciate that we have many worthwhile legislative priorities remaining to be decided, including a majority of appropriations bills that must be passed this year. However, I can think of no better accomplishment for Congress than to reauthorize VAWA and help keep wives, daughters, sisters, and friends from becoming victims of domestic violence.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Balanced Budget Refinement Act introduced today that works to correct the inequities of Medicare reforms included in the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997. 
   I would like to commend Senator DASCHLE for his tremendous efforts on this issue and for his leadership with the introduction of this bill. As well, I  congratulate a number of my other colleagues who have contributed immensely to the crafting of this critically important piece of legislation, including Senators MOYNIHAN, ROCKEFELLER, CONRAD, GRAHAM, KERREY, ROBB, BAUCUS, BREAUX and others. 
   By way of background, as part of the effort to balance the federal budget, the BBA of 1997 provided for major reforms in the way Medicare pays for medical services. The BBA made some important changes in Medicare payment policy and contributed to our current period of budget surpluses through significant cost savings in Medicare. These changes were originally expected to cut Medicare spending by about $112 billion over five years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). 
   However, projections showed spending falling nearly twice that much, and as a result, unintended payment cuts to providers had deepened more significantly than expected. In the face of these profound cuts, health care providers began to struggle, and beneficiary access to care became threatened, due to forced reductions in services especially in rural parts of the country such as South Dakota. As a result, Congress addressed some of these unintended consequences of the BBA by enacting the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA) last year which provided $16 billion over 5 years in payments to various Medicare providers, including; Hospital Outpatient Departments; Skilled Nursing Facilities; Rural Health Providers; Home Health Agencies; Medicare HMOs; and Teaching Hospitals. The impact in South Dakota indicated that approximately 9% of Medicare funding reductions imposed by the BBA of 1997 were returned as a result of the BBRA passed last year, resulting in approximately $15.3 million being restored to South Dakota Medicare providers. 
   While this was certainly a step in the right direction, the BBRA of 1999 did not do enough as concerns from hospital and nursing home administrators, home health facilities, rural health providers, ambulance services and Medicare beneficiaries continued to be heard across the country. 
   Not surprising, I continue to hear from many South Dakota safety net providers about the devastating effects such reductions in Medicare reimbursements are having throughout the health care industry in my home state. Consumers are also feeling the pain, as many individuals are being turned away from hospitals and nursing homes who cannot afford to accept new patients because of the lower reimbursement rates included in BBA of 1997. The undesirable and unintended cuts are devastating and feared to have severe implications on the quality and access of health care throughout our nation, including South Dakota, unless Congress acts immediately to further correct these problems. In South Dakota, and other rural parts of the country, hospitals and other health care providers have an extremely high percentage of Medicare beneficiaries making these cuts in reimbursement even more devastating. If Congress does not act in a timely fashion many of these providers may be forced to close their doors. 
   Nowhere can we see the impact of closures more evident than within the nursing home industry. Nursing homes are experiencing closures at record rates across the country. In South Dakota, just last month we endured our first nursing home closure in Parker, South Dakota. Not only was this devastating for residents and workers, but the domino economic impact that goes hand in hand with such a facility closure is enormous for small communities to absorb. 
   As well, one does not have to look far in my home state of South Dakota to see the impact many other health care providers and facilities are experiencing. Furthermore, the consequences are being felt across the board, from larger health systems in South Dakota communities such as Sioux Falls, Rapid City and Aberdeen, to medium centers in Brookings, Watertown, Pierre and Yankton, to the smaller rural facilities in places like Martin, Edgemont, Gregory, Miller, Hot Springs and Redfield, just to name a few. The situation is arduous for many of these facilities, who often carry the immense task of being the sole health care provider in the entire county. By way of example, Gregory Healthcare Center is a 26 bed rural hospital serving approximately 9,000 people. Not surprising, Gregory is the only local provider to offer a range of services including surgery, obstetrics, and various therapies, and also operates the only home health agency in the area. The facility in Gregory was forced to cut back its' home health services as a result of the BBA Medicare reductions. Many individuals once benefiting from specialized medication oversight and condition management services through Gregory's home health agency were now at home performing these services on their own, resulting in some cases to unnecessary hospitalizations. The situation in Gregory is by far not an isolated situation and facilities nationwide are being forced to cut services just to survive. Whether it be Gregory, South Dakota, or one of far too many other facilities in this country with similar issues, these are direct examples of the intense real life situations that facilities, providers and beneficiaries are experiencing every day as a result of inadequate BBA adjustments, payment updates and beneficiary protections. 
   Therefore, I stand in strong support of the BBRA legislation being introduced today which will address problems facing vital health care services. I look forward to working with my colleagues on passage of the BBRA of 2000 which develops a creative, cost-effective approach to address the unintended, long-term consequences of the BBA. The proposed budget surplus provides Congress the unique opportunity to address many of the deficiencies in our nation's health care system. We need to address the valid concerns of teaching hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health providers, rural and community hospitals, and other health care providers who require relief from the consequences of the BBA.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and my colleague, Senator HUTCHINSON, to introduce the ``Physician Pathology Services Fair Payment Act of 2000.'' This important legislation allows independent laboratories to continue to receive direct payments from Medicare for the technical component of pathology services provided to hospital inpatients and outpatients. This bill encompasses both the inpatient and outpatient technical components in a comprehensive manner than will allow Congress to address both of these pressing issues in a single legislative vehicle. 
   As you know, many hospitals, particularly small and rural hospitals, make arrangements with independent laboratories to provide physician pathology services for their patients. They do so because these hospitals typically lack the patient volume or funds to sustain an in-house pathology department. Yet, if the hospitals are to continue to provide surgery services in the local community, Medicare requires them to provide, directly or under arrangements, certain physician pathology services. Without these arrangements, patients may have to travel far from home to have surgery performed. 
   Recently, HCFA delayed implementation of new inpatient and outpatient technical component (TC) reimbursement rules until January 1, 2001. However, many providers esepectially those in rural or medically underserved areas, remain concerned that the new rules will impose burdensome costs and administrative requirements on hospitals and independent laboratories that have operated in good faith under the prior policy. For hospitals and independent laboratories that have operated in good faith under the prior policy. For hospitals and independent laboratories with existing arrangements, changing the way Medicarepays for the TC physician pathology services provided to hospitals is likely to strain already scarce resources by creating new costs that cannot be easily absorbed. For the first time, independent laboratories will have to generate two bills--one for the technical components to the hospital and onother to Medicare for the professional components. Since each laboratory may serve five, ten or more hospitals, these separate billings will be costly and complicated. 
   The ``Physician Pathology Services Fair Payment Act of 2000'' is essential to the many communities in my home state of South Dakota, and across the country, who rely on the continued presence of pathology services to retain a high-quality health care delivery system that is both responsive and accessible to each and every individual requiring these services. Pathologists provide an extremely powerful and valuable resource to these communities and the ``Physician Pathology Services Fair Payment Act of 2000'' will ensure that these health care professionals continue to positively impact the lives of not only South Dakotans but the lieves of millions of Americans who utilize these services without perhaps even knowing the critical role that they play in our health care delivery system.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today with great pride and satisfaction to address an occasion of great significance that occurred during the Senate's August recess. On August 9, President Clinton awarded the highly prestigious Medal of Freedom to former United States Senator George McGovern. This medal is the very highest award presented to civilians by the United States Government, and is an honor that is richly deserved. 
   Throughout his long and remarkable career, George McGovern has distinguished himself as a scholar, a political leader, a humanitarian and a person of extraordinary integrity. A generation of American political leaders still define themselves as McGovern Democrats.'' At Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, South Dakota, George McGovern effectively emphasized the great importance of public service and civic involvement. As President Kennedy's Director of Food for Peace he helped launch our nation's commitment to combat world hunger. On the floor of the United States Senate, McGovern was a powerful voice for rural America, for our nation's disadvantaged, as well as for an end to the Viet Nam conflict. Today, as ambassador to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization in Rome, Ambassador McGovern has continued his work on nutrition and has articulated a visionary plan for a world school lunch program. 
   As my colleagues are very aware, Senator McGovern won the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in l972 in what turned out to be an unsuccessful presidential campaign. Historians will long ponder what the course of American history might have been if that campaign had turned out differently. But we don't have to wait for the judgment of historians to know George McGovern's life has had an incredibly important and lasting impact on America and the world. George continues to persevere and his commitment to a better planet continues to shine. 
   We in South Dakota understandably feel a profound pride in the life and career of George McGovern--a son of a South Dakota minister, a military hero, a national political leader, and a diplomat of the highest order. I extend my enthusiastic congratulations to Senator McGovern and wish he and his family the very best as he continues his critically important work in Rome.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing today on the critical issue of the entertainment industry's marketing of violent material to children. While I am not a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I appreciated Chairman MCCAIN and Ranking Member HOLLINGS giving me the opportunity to share my perspective as the parent of three children and some insights on the issue I have gained from a series of youth violence meetings in South Dakota. 
   In response to the numerous school shootings around our country, I've held a series of roundtable discussions in South Dakota with parents, students, school officials, and local law enforcement. I heard repeatedly from parents and students themselves that no one believes that explicitly violent movies, video games, or music are the sole causes for violence among our nation's youth. However, South Dakota students acknowledged that the entertainment industry has a large influence on their daily lives, and South Dakota parents specifically asked for additional resources they can use to help keep violent material out of their children's hands. 
   My wife, Barbara, and I recently accompanied our youngest child to her first day at college. Seeing our daughter settle into her new home in the freshman dormitory brought feelings of sadness at the inevitable passage of time. Barbara and I also were relieved, in a sense, by the fact that our daughter's first day of college also marked the successful completion of her childhood. I can sympathize with the parents of children just entering their teen years who are concerned that it will be increasingly difficult to keep objectionable material from their sons and daughters as they grow up. 
   That is why I am troubled by the results of the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Report on the Marketing  of Violent Entertainment to Children. As you know, the President asked the FTC to investigate two simple questions: Do the movie, music recording, and computer game industries market to young people products that contain violent content in a way that undermines the ratings they themselves apply to their products? If so, is that target marketing intentional? According to the recently-released FTC report, the answer to both questions appears to be yes.'' 
   The FTC report found that 80 percent of movies rated R'' for violence were targeted to children under 17. A movie industry document even acknowledged that [o]ur goal was to find the elusive teen target audience and make sure everyone between the ages of 12-18 was exposed to the film.'' Another document spoke of using youth groups such as Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and 4-H Clubs in the market testing of R-rated'' films. 
   Teenagers apparently have also been the target of the music industry's efforts to sell CDs with explicit content labels. According to the FTC report, all music recordings used in the study were in some way targeted toward children under 17. This practice included the placing advertising in media specifically aimed at a youth audience. Finally, the FTC report noted that 70 percent of all video games with ``Mature'' ratings for violence were targeted toward youth. 
   It is important to note that the FTC report also conducted studies on children's ability to access these products. The FTC found that most retailers make little effort to restrict children's access to products with violent content. Almost half of the movie theaters used in the study admitted children ages 13 to 16 to R-rated'' films even when not accompanied by an adult. The FTC study also showed that unaccompanied children were able to buy explicit recordings and Mature-rated'' video games 85 percent of the time. 
   The FTC's findings are staggering, and I am eager to hear the entertainment industry's response to the report. Clearly, the entertainment industry and its retail partners must refocus their efforts and work with the FTC and concerned members of Congress like myself to keep violent material out of the hands of children. 
   It is my hope that the entertainment industry will take this opportunity to help restore the faith of the American public in its voluntary ratings system. Parents in South Dakota and around the country must also have resources they can trust to help them prevent youth violence in their own communities. 
   I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues and members of the industry on ways to keep violent material out of the hands of children without infringing on fundamental First Amendment rights.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senators from Delaware and New York. 
   Mr. President, my purpose today is to share some thoughts about the critical importance of PNTR legislation. Because my good friend and colleague from Idaho, just prior to my opportunity this morning, discussed the role of my good colleague from South Dakota, Senator DASCHLE, relative to the timing of legislation, I do feel compelled to make a remark or two in that regard. 
   No one in this body has done more than Senator DASCHLE of South Dakota to move legislation forward in an expeditious and well-timed manner. Whether it is PNTR, where Senator DASCHLE has for months been trying to bring this bill to the floor, or the Patients' Bill of Rights, prescription drugs, school construction, minimum wage, and down the entire list of legislative agenda items before this body, Senator DASCHLE has been tireless in his efforts to bring them to the floor, to have consideration in a full manner. For anyone to suggest that somehow our good colleague from South Dakota would be playing some role in slowing down progress on these or other matters, I think, is a point simply not correct. 
   I comment as well that while the President of the United States is seeking additional fuel from Saudi Arabia, it strikes me, and strikes others who are not concerned about the partisan politics of this, that is what we would expect the President of the United States to be doing at this summit conference in New York--trying to address the various components of energy policy necessary to reduce costs and increase the availability of fuel for American consumers. If the President were not doing that, there is no doubt there would be criticism leveled at him for doing nothing to negotiate and use American leverage with our OPEC neighbors and the world. 
   I think some of this discussion earlier this morning has to be seen and evaluated in light of the fact that we are in this last month or two before a Presidential election. The partisan swords clearly have been drawn this morning. I should never be shocked at that, I suppose, particularly in an election year at this time of the year. But it is my hope that through all of this partisan political rhetoric, the American public will see through that. I think it is transparent. 
   We need to work together in a bipartisan fashion. One of the things I am pleased about this morning is the bipartisan nature of our support for permanent normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China. Our distinguished colleague, Senator MOYNIHAN, who, among his other talents, is perhaps the finest scholar in this body--for many years, many generations--has observed that this may be one of the half dozen most critically important votes that we as Senators will take since the end of World War II. 
   Obviously, this issue is of enormous import in terms of economic policy, economic strategy for the United States. It is a win situation for us. It is one sided. They give up limitations against the export of Americans goods. We give up nothing. But even if economic issues were a wash, even if there were not these kinds of obvious economic benefits for the United States, the geopolitical consequences of integrating the People's Republic of China's 1.3 billion people into the world rule of law, into the international community of nations to help stabilize the ongoing process of democratization and the free flow of ideas and scholars and business leaders is, in itself, reason enough for support for permanent normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China. 
   So I rise to express my strong support for H.R. 4444, legislation which would grant PNTR to the People's Republic of China. In the past, Congress has had to pass legislation each and every year to ensure mutually beneficial relations between our two nations. Now we have reached the point where permanent normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China is appropriate and will help pave the way for the World Trade Organization, WTO, membership for the PRC, and will strike a blow for the rule of law throughout the world. 
   I am joining the leadership of both parties to oppose all amendments to PNTR, due to the very late stage of the congressional session in which we are taking up this bill. Many Senators will offer important amendments to H.R. 4444 concerning worker's rights, religious freedom, and human rights in the PRC. I support efforts to improve China's human rights record, the right of workers to organize, and religious freedom in China. But, I believe that jeopardizing H.R. 4444 is exactly the wrong approach. As a nation, we have attempted to promote global human rights, democracy, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. While each nation ultimately determines for itself whether to pursue democracy and other American-supported values, I support efforts to open China to trade with democratic cultures. I am also opposed, obviously, to religious persecution and will support efforts to discourage it in China. However, there are other pieces of legislation that can be used to achieve these goals. The PNTR bill must be adopted in an amendment-free fashion if we are to avoid its ultimate defeat. With few days remaining in Congress, a PNTR bill adopted by the Senate that differs from the clean bill passed in the House of Representatives would force us to convene a conference committee to iron out the bill's differences. The result--significant delay which would be compounded by the margin in which the House adopted H.R. 4444 in May. Sending PNTR back to the House for another vote very likely means its ultimate defeat for this year. At this late stage in Congress, that is not an acceptable strategy for any of us to endorse. 
   It is true this vote is of significant importance to family farmers, ranchers, and independent businesses in South Dakota and the entire country. However, this vote means much, much more--I believe this vote signifies one of the most critical geo-political votes the U.S. Senate will take since World War II. 
   China, with its 1.2 billion people and one of the fastest growing economies in the world, needs to be required to live by the discipline of international law. That is what World Trade Organization--[WTO] membership would mean. China would have to open up its agricultural and other markets to the world, and it would not be permitted to violate international rules on copyright or patents. As a result of PNTR, I believe the presence of western consumer products, the exchange of democratic principles, and the free flow of ideas via technology and internet communication will do more to undermine authoritarian aspects of China's government than any kind of isolation could possibly accomplish--particularly unilateral isolation on the part of the United States. I feel very strongly that we need to build more bridges of understanding and cooperation between western democracies and the PRC, rather than work for the contrary. In the meantime, the biggest winners of all in establishing the same normalized trading relationships with China that we have with almost every other nation on the planet will be American farmers and ranchers and small businesses. 
   The bilateral deal struck between the United States and China on November 15, 1999 is a completely one-sided trade agreement. China will be required to allow more of our goods into their country, while the United States will not be required to change a thing. Frankly, a failure to enact PNTR will simply mean that every other country in the world would have open access to Chinese markets, but the United States would have virtually none. Since the United States has few barriers to trade, and current trade restrictions are almost exclusively on the part of China and other nations, WTO agreements in  general are overwhelmingly to the benefit of the United States. 
   I have been to China and witnessed first-hand the opportunities for greater market access there. Since 1998, I have facilitated a series of trade missions to improve relations with China. The relationships we have built in this course of time may open markets for the farmers and ranchers of South Dakota and the United States. 
   In March of 1998, my office hosted senior trade and agriculture officials from the Chinese Embassy on a trade mission to South Dakota. The officials toured the John Morrell meatpacking plant in Sioux Falls, the South Dakota Wheat Growers Cooperative in Aberdeen, and the Harvest States Feed Mill in Sioux Falls. During their visit, the Chinese trade officials also witnessed the ingenuity of South Dakota businesses like Gateway of North Sioux City, Daktronics of Brookings, and Wildcat Manufacturing of Freeman. The officials were impressed with our diversified economy and the quality and pride in our products. 
   In a follow-up mission, in December of 1998, I led a delegation of South Dakota farmers to the PRC. We met with trade officials and scholars at the Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing University, and Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. 
   Finally, in May of 1999, a 29-member delegation of Chinese trade officials traveled to South Dakota at my request to further explore agricultural trade opportunities. These Chinese officials met with farm group leaders, toured farming and ranching operations, and visited the South Dakota Soybean Processors plant near Volga. 
   My visit to China, and discussions with Chinese trade officials, indicate that family farmers and ranchers in South Dakota are ideally situated to help satisfy the needs of China's 1.2 billion residents, who exhibit a growing appetite for a more sophisticated diet. China's agricultural production capabilities just cannot satisfy their people's needs right now, especially considering the country represents a mere 7 percent of the world's arable land. 
   South Dakota agricultural exports in 1998 reached $1.1 billion and supported nearly 17,000 jobs. While Congress needs to place a much greater emphasis on improving domestic policies--like reforming the 1996 farm bill--greater access to closed-off markets will provide a boost to our agricultural economy too. Two-thirds of the prosperity or decline in South Dakota agriculture still depends upon a fair marketplace price here at home. I believe Congress has failed to make common sense reforms to the farm bill which may allow farmers to take advantage of a fair market. Nonetheless, one-third of our agricultural economy requires trade with other nations. Under the agreement we struck with China, South Dakota farmers and ranchers will no longer have to compete with unfair tariffs, unscientific bans, and export subsidies on China's agricultural goods. 
   Beef cattle receipts represent the largest share of South Dakota's agricultural economy. China currently imports very little beef, but a growing middle class and rising demand from urban areas are expected to result in significantly increased demand for beef imports. China has agreed to lower tariffs on beef meat products from 45 to 12 percent, which may mean better returns for independent cattle ranchers in South Dakota. In addition, tariffs on pork imports into China will decline from 20 to 12 percent, aiding South Dakota's pork products as well. 
   Wheat farmers in South Dakota desire greater access to the Chinese marketplace. As a result of our agreement with China, they will eliminate their unscientific ban on Pacific Northwest wheat imports from the United States. They will also agree to a substantial increase in the amount of wheat they purchase under their tariff rate quota. In 1998 China imported a mere 2 million metric tons of wheat. Our agreement will allow China to purchase up to 9.6 million tons of wheat below tariff rate quotas. In fact, in February of this year, China bought nearly 800,000 bushels of hard red winter and spring wheat from South Dakota and several other wheat growing states. While a relatively small transaction, their commitment to more open trade with the U.S. is exhibited with this purchase. 
   Furthermore, as a large soybean producer, South Dakota's soybean farmers and farmer-owned processors of soybeans will benefit from a tariff cut China agreed to make on United States soybean exports. South Dakota farmers also produce substantial bushels of feed grain and corn. China agreed to make market-oriented changes to their tariff rate quota system on corn, nearly doubling the amount of corn they import under their tariff quota rate. 
   While South Dakota agriculture is poised to benefit from greater trade with China, other businesses in our state are set to become major exporters under a more market-oriented trading system granted by PNTR for China as well. In fact, electronics and electronic equipment today comprise 78 percent of total South Dakota exports to China. More than half of the South Dakota firms, 58 percent, that export to China are small and mid-sized enterprises--with fewer than 500 employees--and several are family owned. China will liberalize quotas on manufacturing equipment, information technology products, and electronic goods produced right in South Dakota. This means our computer manufacturers like Gateway and equipment firms like Wildcat Manufacturing will find greater access to that nation. 
   From 1993 to 1998, South Dakota's exports to China nearly doubled--increasing by over 91 percent. I believe that if the Senate adopts H.R. 4444, South Dakota farmers, ranchers, and businesses will see tremendous new trade opportunities. 
   Now is the time for the Senate to take advantage of this historic opportunity before us. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of a clean PNTR bill so that it can be sent to the President and signed into law in a proper fashion. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to take this opportunity to join my colleagues to discuss the issue of the how the Missouri River should be managed by the Corps of Engineers. I strongly urge the Senate to adopt the Daschle-Baucus-Johnson amendment to strike Section 103 from the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which prevents needed changes to the management of the Missouri River that have been called for by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. President Clinton has stated that he will veto the bill if this amendment is not included. The time has come to manage the river in line with current economic realities. 
   This issue has come before the Senate because some Senators from states downstream on the Missouri River are attempting to politicize the management of the River. As has been done in the last four years, they are trying to politicize this issue by adding a rider to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill to prevent the Army Corps of Engineers from changing the 40 year old master manual that sets the management policy of the river. 
   Mr. President, let me assure you and the rest of my colleagues that after 40 years, the management of the Missouri River is in serious need of an update to reflect the current realities of the River. The Corps current plan for managing water flow from the Missouri River Dams, known as the master manual provides relatively steady flows during the spring, summer and fall to support a $7 million downstream barge industry. The manual has not been substantially revised on 40 years. 
   In that time, the projections of barge traffic used to justify the manual have never materialized. Instead, the steady flows required by the manual have contributed to the decline of fish and wildlife along the river. 
   To counter this problem, the Army Corps of Engineers has proposed a revision of the master manual which governs how the river is managed. 
   I was among those who first called for a revision of the master manual because I firmly believed then, as I do now, that over the years, we in the Upper Basin states have lived with an unfortunate lack of parity under the current management practices on the Missouri River. It is no secret that we continue to suffer from an upstream vs. downstream conflict of interest on Missouri River uses. Navigation has been emphasized on the Missouri River, to the detriment of river ecosystems and recreational uses. I recognize that navigation activities often support midwestern agriculture, however the navigation industry has been declining since it peaked in the late 1970's. It is no longer appropriate to grossly favor navigation above other uses of the river. 
   Those of us from the upstream States have been working for more than 10 years to get the Corps of Engineers to finally make changes in the 40 year old master manual for the Missouri River. 
   After more than 40 years, the time has come for the management of the Missouri River to reflect the current economic realities of an $90 million annual recreation impact upstream, versus a $7 million annual navigation impact downstream. The downstream barge industry carries only 3/10 percent of all agriculture goods transported in the upper Midwest. The Corps has been managing the Missouri River for navigation for far too long and it is time to finally bring the master manual into line with current economic realities. Passage of the Daschle-Baucus-Johnson amendment will do just that. 
   As I stated earlier, the process to review and update the master manual began more than 10 years ago, in 1989, in response to concerns regarding the operation of the main stem dams, mainly during drought periods. A draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was published in September 1994 and was followed by a public comment period. In response to numerous comments, the Corps agreed to prepare a revised DEIS. 
   After years of revisions and updates that have dragged this process out to ridiculous lengths, the Corps finally came forward with alternatives to the current master manual, including the ``split season'' alternative, which I strongly support, along with my colleagues from the Upper Basin States. 
   The rider to prevent implementation of changes in the manual has been included for the last 4 years. In previous years, this rider was not as important because the Corps was not ready to revise the river management policies. However, this year, the Corps is consulting extensively with the Fish and Wildlife Service and is officially learning that it must implement a spring rise and split season to avoid driving endangered species to extinction. Since the Corps finally has a schedule to complete the process in the near future, rejecting this rider is more than important than ever. 
   Those of us from the States in the Upper Basin are determined to work aggressively for the interests of our region. For decades our states have made many significant sacrifices which have benefitted people living further south along the Missouri River. 
   Mr. President, now is the time to finally bring an outdated and unfair management plan for the Missouri River up to date with modern economic realities. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I will vote to uphold the President's veto of the wildly irresponsible estate tax repeal bill sent to his desk, and I will also continue to support changes in the law that will provide additional relief for the two percent of American families that are subject to this law. 
   Under current law, family farms and small business pay no Federal estate tax unless their property is worth more than $1.3 million. Others are eligible for an estate tax exemption of $675,000. I recently voted to raise the small business and family farm exemption to $4 million by 2001 and with a phased in exemption of $8 million by 2010. The general exemption would increase to $2 million by 2001 and $4 million by 2010. 
   The cost to the Treasury for this additional exemption for America's wealthiest families comes to about $61 billion over ten years. The cost of the total-repeal bill being vetoed by the President, however, comes to $105 billion over the first ten years, and a whopping $750 billion when fully phased in during the next ten years. 
   Very few South Dakota farms or small businesses have any Federal estate tax liability whatever under current law, but I do want to make sure that exemptions are ample. What I don't want to see, however, is an estate tax repeal bill that is so terribly expensive that it makes it almost impossible for Congress to pass tax relief for middle class taxpayers, to shore up Medicare, to pay down more of the accumulated national debt or improve education. 
   Keep in mind that most of the budget surplus that is being talked about will not materialize for another five years or so, and prudence would suggest to us that it may never materialize at all. Thank heavens for some adult supervision from the White House at a time when Congress has been behaving like spoiled children under the Christmas tree. Supporters of this irresponsible legislation believe there is room in our budget to give multimillionaires an $8 million tax break, but the legislation sent to the President would have broken the bank and denied relief and assistance to the other 98 percent of American families. 
   Once Congress concludes its partisan political finger-pointing games, it is my hope that estate tax and marriage penalty relief can be passed in a proper and careful manner that will allow for debt reduction, Medicare improvements, and a commitment to education.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor S. Res. 133, a resolution supporting religious tolerance toward Muslims. I wholeheartedly believe that anti-Muslim intolerance and discrimination should be condemned and must be fought at every opportunity. As Americans, we enjoy the right to speak and think freely. With that right comes a responsibility to ensure that free speech does not foster intolerance and lead to an atmosphere of hatred or fear. It is wrong when entire religions are made to be a scapegoat because of ignorance or spite, and I will continue to do all I can to promote thoughtful understanding and appreciation of the Muslim faith. 
   I am proud of the accomplishments and contributions made by Muslims in South Dakota and across America. I am hopeful that the Senate and entire Congress will approve this resolution in order to highlight the important role Muslim Americans play in our society.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to take this opportunity to join my colleagues to discuss the issue of how the Missouri River should be managed by the Corps of Engineers and to address the remarks made earlier this week by my friends and colleagues from Missouri, Senators Bond and Ashcroft. This issue has come before the Senate because some of my colleagues from states downstream on the Missouri River are attempting to politicize the management of the River. 
   They are trying to politicize this issue by adding a rider to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill to prevent the Corps of Engineers from changing the 40 year old Master Manual that sets the management policy of the River. 
   Let me assure you and the rest of my colleagues that after 40 years, the management of the Missouri River is in serious need of an update to reflect the current realities of the River.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Dr. Samir Abu-Ghazaleh, who has been appointed by President Clinton to the National Cancer Advisory Board. Dr. Abu-Ghazaleh is currently a gynecologic oncologist at the Avera Cancer Institute in Sioux Falls, South Dakota where he has been successfully serving the important health needs of the citizens in my home state. 
   Dr. Abu-Ghazaleh attended Nahara College and received a MB.B. from Ain Shams University Medical School, both in Cairo. He did his residency in OB-GYN in Yankton, South Dakota, at the University of South Dakota Affiliated Hospital, from 1972 to 1976. He also held a residency in gynecologic oncology at Duke University, from 1976 to 1978. 
   After finishing his schooling in medicine, Dr. Abu-Ghazaleh returned to South Dakota where he served as the Director of the OB-GYN Student Teaching Program from 1981 to 1985, and an Associate Professor from 1980 to 1985, at the University of South Dakota School of Medicine. When not practicing medicine, Dr. Abu-Ghazaleh is writing about it. He is the author of numerous articles on gynecology and oncology. The community in which he practices is important to him and he has hosted several workshops and presentations as a free service to inform the public and increase cancer awareness, particularly concerning women's health issues. 
   Dr. Abu-Ghazaleh is a member of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group, the Gynecologic Oncology Group, and the American College of Gynecologists. He has also been a member of the National Cancer Institute. Beginning in 1985, he has continued to serve as a Fellow of American College of Surgeons. Additionally, Dr. Abu-Ghazaleh has been a Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Surgical Gynecologic Oncologists since 1980. 
   It is with great pride and pleasure that I rise in recognition to an outstanding health care provider, an honored member of the National Cancer Advisory Board, and a true asset to the state of South Dakota. He is a man who has dedicated his life to helping others and providing education on the serious illness of cancer. Again, congratulations to Dr. Samir Abu-Ghazaleh. I trust the Advisory Board will find him a valuable asset and a skilled advisor.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to add my condolences to that of my colleagues on the passing of our friend and colleague, Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia. 
   Senator Coverdell was a model of proper conduct and decorum becoming of a Senator. He conducted himself in the quiet, deliberative manner that reflected his commitment to a thorough performance of his duties. He was a true leader, willing to do his best for all Americans. 
   Most recently, he and I worked together to keep our nation's promise to provide health care coverage to military retirees, when we introduced legislation together earlier this year. As my colleagues know, Senator Coverdell had extreme pride in this country. It was an honor to work with him on making good to those people who have served their nation and are now in the years of declining health. It was also an honor to work with Senator Coverdell every day, for he was truly interested in ensuring our democracy remained strong and pushed forward confidently into the Twenty-first Century. 
   Mr. President, I wish to extend my condolences to the Coverdell family, including his many friends and his staff. The entire Senate family has lost a friend and the nation has lost a leader. However, we are all enriched by having known such an honorable man. His service and commitment will have a definite and lasting legacy.

   Mr. JOHNSON. I represent a western gold mining State. I have just returned recently from examining the Brohm site in the beautiful Black Hills of South Dakota where the Brohm Mining Company has gone bankrupt with approximately a $5 million bond. That site has now been declared a Superfund  site. It is now going to cost the Federal taxpayers approximately $27 million because of the inadequacy of the bond at this site. It is going to cost the taxpayers of the State of South Dakota in perpetuity tens of millions of dollars to monitor the streams and the environment around that bankrupt site. 
   Is the Senator telling us that without the amendment he is offering here, we will continue to see these inadequate bonds and these costs being shifted to the taxpayers to pick up the cost of mining companies--oftentimes foreign mining companies--that have spoiled our land and then walk on?

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to join Senators DORGAN and JEFFORDS in support of the prescription drug amendment being offered to the Agriculture Appropriations bill currently pending before this body. I commend my colleagues for their steadfast commitment to addressing this critically important issue. Like all of my colleagues, I deplore conditions that lead to Americans choosing between buying food for their family or medicine for their illnesses which is a choice that millions of consumers in this country are forced to make every day. This is a travesty and one that I am committed to put an end to.  
   The discussion of prescription drug pricing, accessibility, affordability, and safety has been elevated to new heights in the last year as we in Congress work to develop a practical and cost-effective approach to providing relief to combat escalating prescription drug prices for consumers throughout the United States. 
   Numerous studies have been conducted that highlight the price differentials existing between the United States, our neighbors to the North and South, and countries in the European Union. Several reports confirm that pharmaceutical prices are substantially higher in the United States than other countries. 
   Consider how drug prices charged to Americans differ from the drug prices paid by people living in other areas of the world as reported from a study done by the PRIME Institute at the University of Minnesota. 
   The study found that if Americans pay an average of $1.00 for a pharmaceutical product, that exact same product with the exact same dosage would have a much lower average cost in other industrialized nations. On average, that $1.00 product in the United States would cost .64 cents in Canada, .68 cents in Sweden, .65 cents in England, .71 cents in Germany, .57 cents in France, and .51 cents in Italy. 
   This amounts to price-gouging of Americans. It's wrong, and it has to stop. 
   So you ask, why don't Americans just buy it over the border and bring it back to the U.S.? Well, some individuals are being forced to take such drastic measures. South Dakota, though it does not share a border with another country, has an increasing number of individuals willing to make the drive to either Mexico or Canada, knowing full well that the savings are great enough to more than offset any expenses occurred in the process. 
   Presently, anecdotal evidence suggests that thousands of Americans cross the border to see a doctor and get their prescriptions filled for 25-50% less in cost for many popular prescription drugs. Here are a couple stories that have been shared with me over the last year: 
   A 72 year-old woman in Arlington, SD who spends $243 a month on prescription drugs wrote to me and said, ``The meds are so high in South Dakota. I try to get as much of them in Mexico as I can. I don't understand why there has to be such a difference in price.'' 
   A 41-year-old man suffering from a disease that requires daily medication at a cost of more than $400 per month wrote to me and said, ``I want you to know that while I recognize that seniors are particularly hurt by unfair prescription pricing due to their fixed incomes, other Americans also feel the pinch. The same medication that I take is available in Mexico at less than half the price that it costs me in the U.S. Unfortunately, I can not afford to travel to Mexico periodically to obtain my prescription.'' 
   Under current federal law, however, pharmaceutical companies are the only ones allowed to import drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration into this country. Yet, if an American pharmacist or distributor wants to purchase these FDA-approved drugs at the lower prices available in other countries and pass the savings along to their customers, they are prohibited by law from doing so. 
   On July 10, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed two amendments to the Agriculture Appropriations bill that would allow widespread importation of prescription drugs without any FDA oversight. The overwhelming bipartisan support for these amendments clearly shows that Congress no longer wants to deny American consumers access to FDA approved medications that are available in other countries at much lower prices. I support that position and, in fact, have sponsored legislation introduced by my colleagues Senators DORGAN and JEFFORDS regarding international pricing disparities. 
   While I agree with the intent of the House action, I have concerns that the House provisions do not include the safety mechanisms necessary to ensure that only safe and effective FDA approved medications cross our borders. Perhaps the number one concern mentioned in regard to the reimportation of prescription drugs is the safety of the consumer. As with any product that passes through multiple distribution channels, it is important that a baseline be established to ensure proper handling and storage. This is particularly crucial in maintaining the therapeutic equivalence of prescription drugs. 
   The amendment we are offering today, which would amend federal law to allow pharmacists, distributors and licensed wholesalers to legally import U.S. FDA approved prescription drugs, addresses this concern by implementing assurances that any prescription drug reimported under this proposal be manufactured, packaged, and labelled according to FDA standards. It includes the essential safety provisions that will allow American consumers to benefit from international price competition for prescription drugs in the safest manner possible. 
   Many pro-consumer groups such as Families USA, Public Citizen and the National Community Pharmacists Association endorse this amendment saying it is a positive step towards leveling the playing field for prescription drug prices and would save U.S. consumers billions of dollars by allowing the safe reimportation of American-made, FDA-approved prescription drugs. 
   Of course, the pharmaceutical industry presents many economic and proprietary rationales for price disparities. From price controls to R&D to currency exchange rates, arguments are made that the prices garnered by some pharmaceutical companies are justified in a world where price is a measure of willingness to pay and price elasticity, not compassion or empathy. 
   Industry representatives have stated it would be profoundly fatal to allow for the reimportation of pharmaceutical drugs from other countries who purchase them at a much lower cost than our nation's senior population as this will create instability in the world's pharmaceutical markets. Personally, I can think of nothing more tragic than charging Americans prices for prescription medications that cost far more than the majority of Americans are able to pay without sacrificing one or more basic needs in their lives. 
   In my home state of South Dakota, I am conducting prescription drug meetings where constituents are able to communicate their concerns regarding prescription drug prices and express their ability, or perhaps inability, to pay for therapeutic regiments prescribed by their physician. Many of them ask, ``Why are citizens of other countries able to purchase their prescriptions at such lower prices?'' After all the arguments I have heard from the industry on why this is the case, I 
   have yet to hear an acceptable response that I could give. 
   Perhaps the most disturbing argument that I have heard in the past year came from an industry representative during an Alliance for Health Reform briefing last year. Our colleague, Senator ROCKEFELLER, read a question from the crowd that asked why this individual's brother-in-law got the same medication from the same U.S. manufacturer for a considerable amount less. What I heard in response was shocking. The following quote is taken verbatim from the transcript of that briefing:  
   Price discrimination is an economic concept that merely means different people in different markets are charged different things. In this particular case, price discrimination exists between the Canadian market and American market, for lots of reasons: differences in medical practice, how much of the product is sold, difference in exchange rates, different kinds of patent protections, the length and cost in time of distributing drugs and the marketing of drugs, and differences in living standards. 
   [You] could have used Mexico as your example and would have found that it is less than a third of the price potentially and that's in large part because the standard of living is substantially lower and they can afford so much less. Beyond that, and the other income differences, there is the difference in willingness to pay.  
   The idea that Americans are charged what they are because they are willing to pay for it, is perhaps the most insensitive of all arguments. Can you imagine measuring the value of someone's life by whether or not they are willing to fill their prescription to control their cholesterol level or pay their rent? As well, the standard of living that exists for most elderly in the United States is precisely the reason  why we are having this hearing today. The simple fact is many seniors are not able to meet all of their basic needs and adhere to their prescription regiment. The number of South Dakotans who, due to their standard of living, can not afford their prescription drugs suggests that the pricing of pharmaceutical goes far beyond reasons based on standard of living and willingness to pay otherwise South Dakotans would have no problem affording their prescription drugs. 
   Mr. President, I am reminded of a popular fast food chain motto some years back that proclaimed, ``Make a run for the border.'' Who would have ever thought that we would be applying this same motto to the citizens of our country with regard to their prescription drug needs. 
   The amendment before us is an appropriate response to the discriminatory pricing practices engaged in by much of the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry, year after year, sits at the top of the Fortune Magazine list of most profitable industries in the country. The latest report covering 1999 showed the industry maintained top rankings from previous years: No. 1 in return on revenues, No. 1 in return on assets, No. 1 in return on equity. And the prices they charge to the uninsured in America remain the highest in the world. 
   For years, Americans have paid the price in more ways than just at the pharmacy counter for the cost of their prescription drugs. Improper prescription drug usage results in thousands of deaths a year though the exact number of seniors included in this number may never be known. How many seniors skip a day's pill or cut them in half in order to stretch their prescription just one more day? I would argue that even one is too many. 
   We are all working to address the concerns of not only our constituents in our respective home states but for citizens across this nation that rely on prescription drugs for their health care needs. I believe that every Senator here today is deeply concerned about the rising out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and hopefully we can address many of these concerns here today with passage of this amendment. 
   I am pleased to join Senators DORGAN and JEFFORDS in cosponsoring this crucial amendment and urge all of my colleagues to support its immediate passage.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in this important discussion concerning the National Park Service's recent proposal to substantially curb recreational snowmobile use within the national park system. 
   I believe that virtually everyone can agree that snowmobile use in national parks must be carefully managed in a manner which balances legitimate recreational needs with a concern for public safety and environmental protection. Nobody argues that snowmobiles should be allowed in every area of every park and without regard for noise, speed or numbers. But at the same time, snowmobiling is a recreational option that should not be totally banned or limited in an unreasonable manner. 
   I appreciate that the National Park Service has now ``clarified'' its earlier statements which created the impression that an across-the-board ban on snowmobiles in all parts of all parks was about to be established. The Park Service tells us that rather than a ban, it wants to curtail snowmobile use on park lands. 
   I will follow this new approach carefully. Again, few South Dakotans have objections to reasonable rules designed to protect the environment, protect wildlife habitat and address issues of noise, safety and numbers. But regulations to properly address these matters do not require a total ban or draconian limitations on snowmobile use. I will urge the National Park Service to listen to all segments of the American public in a careful, thoughtful manner and seek to strike a sensible balance that will protect our natural heritage but also allow for reasonable and well-managed winter recreation opportunities for all our citizens. It certainly would be better for the National Park Service to administratively arrive at balanced final rules, than to necessitate legislative action on the part of Congress. If legislation is ultimately required on this matter, I will work with both my House and Senate colleagues in a bipartisan manner to secure a balanced final resolution of this issue.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the estate tax repeal bill which is currently pending before this body. Like all of my colleagues, I deplore conditions that lead to families losing their family businesses and farms. The family farm is at dire risk of becoming extinct. Some of my colleagues want to attribute this to the estate tax which they claim prevents succeeding generations from carrying on their heritage. Rightfully, that blame belongs to a failed farm policy more than a progressive tax policy. The failed Freedom to Farm policy has driven more farmers out of business than any inheritance tax. 
   In my state of South Dakota, 102 estates had to pay federal estate tax in 1997. That figure amounts to .2 percent of all estates for that year. I support bringing more relief to the bulk of these estates that are trying to pass down family businesses and farms to their children, but the proposal before us does nothing for these families for ten years while bringing immediate help to the elite of the wealthy.  
   The House passed plan essentially does nothing for most estates that pay the estate tax over the next decade. The benefits go only to the super-rich worth almost $4 million. Only after ten years will the family farmer and small business owner see any benefit. At that point, the entire estate tax is eliminated, exploding a $50 billion annual hole in the budget. 
   I support some estate tax relief aimed at preserving family farms and small businesses. Under current law, a couple with a farm or business worth up to $2.6 million can give it to their heirs tax-free. Our approach would raise that to $4 million, which would mean that only 1 out of every 100 estates would face any federal estate tax. 
   But it would not help the super-rich, as the Republican proposal would. The federal estate tax is a progressive tax. In 1998 more than half the money collected came from estates of $5 million or more. There were exactly 2,898 such estates nationwide. In other words, the Republican plan is aimed predominantly at helping the richest of the rich in our country. Fewer than three thousand estates would get the bulk of this tax break. Three thousand of the richest families in America would benefit. 
   I do not begrudge the wealthy their position. Wealth is often accumulated through hard work, serendipity and more hard work. However, there is no compelling public policy reason to give the largest single tax break in American history to those fortunate enough to be born into the right families, and expend so much revenue doing so that nothing is left for tax relief for the middle class, paying down accumulated national debt, improving schools, Medicare or veterans health care. Especially when we have such critical needs elsewhere in our society. The majority wants to give a tax break to fewer than three thousand families that will cost over $50 billion annually. The Democrats want to help families maintain their small businesses and family farms, and we can do that for $20 billion per year. With the remainder of that money, we can help millions of Americans meet their basic needs such as helping with extraordinarily high prescription drug costs, child care or education related expenses. 
   Why is it that the Senate can somehow find all this time to debate tax bills, which I agree are 
   legitimate and important issues, but we can't find the time in this body to debate the number one issue facing the elderly and disabled in this country--rising prescription drug expenses? 
   Not only should we be here today questioning why it is not good policy to only give enormous federal tax breaks to the super rich but maybe we should also be questioning the huge tax breaks that go to the multi-million dollar drug companies. As reported by Fortune 500 magazine earlier this year, the pharmaceutical companies once again represent the most profitable industry in this country with profits three times that of other industries. These are the same companies that are price gouging millions of elderly senior citizens throughout America, many of whom can't afford their daily medications. Millions of individuals who Congress thus far has said ``no we can't help you this year because we don't have the time to debate prescription drug proposals''. Instead, we are saying to the American public that we can find the time and money to pass a fiscally irresponsible estate tax bill that will probably not help any of the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who struggle between paying for their prescription drugs and groceries. 
   I think we should do both. I believe we could pass a meaningful and fiscally responsible estate tax bill and still have resources available for addressing critically important priorities such as prescription drugs. Instead, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to use all of these resources solely for a bloated estate tax bill that will benefit only three thousand families. 
   Prescription drug prices are skyrocketing at unfathomable levels and drug expenditures have grown at double-digit rates during almost every year since 1980 and more than twice the rate of all other health care expenses. Not surprising, the elderly and in particular elderly women, see the largest increases. Combine this crisis with the fact that the Senate has less than eight working weeks left this year and held only one floor debate on a prescription drug bill thus far, which was forced by members on this side of the aisle, and you find the picture for the American senior looking very bleak. If we cannot address the prescription drug issue now, then when? 
   I am committed to helping seniors and those disabled on Medicare afford their prescription drugs. Equally, I am not going to stop fighting for lower prescription drug prices for Americans who pay by far more for prescription drugs than people in other countries. 
   Several bills that I have sponsored this Congress aim to address the problem of escalating prescription drug prices. However, these and other prescription drug bills have been the target of an aggressive multi million dollar advertising campaign, operated by the pharmaceutical industry and their so called front group called Citizens For Better Medicare, aimed to kill any hopes of prescription drug legislation this year. In fact, I question just how many ``real citizens'' are behind that name? According to Public Citizen the drug industry is on pace to spend nearly $14 million every election and another $150 million every two years lobbying Congress to protect its incredibly high profit rates. This is the classic case of the role of big money in politics: the industry takes in billions in profits from high prices and gives out millions in campaign contributions to make sure Congress protects those profits. 
   The time for Congress to act on providing an affordable, accessible prescription drug bill, while at the same time addressing skyrocketing drug prices, is now. Congress cannot be bullied by the big drug companies pocketbook any longer. Better yet, the American public cannot wait any longer. In the next couple of days the Senate may take up yet another tax bill and we will again be faced with an opportunity to address such critical priorities as prescription drugs. But I guess the American public will have to stay tuned as to whether or not we will even be given the opportunity to debate one of the greatest issues facing our nation.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like to briefly express my full support for the funding contained in the fiscal year 2001 Interior Appropriations bill for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). Yesterday, I joined 72 of my Senate colleagues--Republicans and Democrats alike--in defeating an effort to cut the NEA's budget. The funding level approved in the Senate version of the Interior Appropriations bill is $7 million above that approved by the House of Representatives and represents a modest increase from last year's budget. 
   Opponents of the NEA claim that it simply subsidizes a small number of wealthy people in the big cities. The truth is that the NEA supports public-private art projects that benefit millions of people across our country; young and old, rich and poor, rural and urban. One needs to simply look at the NEA's role in South Dakota to see how a small percentage of our tax dollars improve the lives of entire communities in our state. 
   Last year, South Dakota received over $630,000 in grants from the NEA. That equates to nearly one dollar for every resident of our state. NEA grants are coordinated by the South Dakota Arts Council, and this successful federal-local-private relationship supports programs like the L. Frank Baum Oz Festival in Aberdeen. NEA funds were instrumental in getting the Washington Pavilion of Arts and Sciences constructed in Sioux Falls. In fact, the Black Hills Community Theatre and the Black Hills Symphony Orchestra provide year-long entertainment as a direct result of NEA funds. Residents of Brookings benefitted from NEA funding of the Brookings Chamber Music Society, the SDSU-Civic Symphony, and the Prairie Repertory Theatre. Restoration of the Historic Homestake Opera House in Lead has been supported through the NEA. In Pierre, NEA funds have allowed the Capital City Children's Chorus to entertain area residents. Vermillion's historic Shrine to Music Museum receives NEA support for its annual programs, and Watertown's Symphony Orchestra and Town Players theater group also received NEA funds this past year. I just returned from attending a performance of ``Spiritscapes'', a South Dakota cantata, at the Sioux Falls Washington Pavilion which was financed in part by the NEA.  
   However, it isn't just the larger cities in South Dakota that benefit from NEA funding. Last year, the South Dakota Arts Council funded over 220 weeks of Artists-In-Schools residencies conducted by professional artists at schools and other educational institutions throughout our state. Some of the communities that benefitted from the annual Artists-In-Schools program include: Arlington, Batesland, Belle Fourche, Beresford, Box Elder, Brandon, Buffalo, Canton, Castlewood, Cavour, Centerville, Chester, Clark, Doland, Emery, Fairfax, Faulkton, Garretson, Gettysburg, Harrold, Hartford, Hitchcock, Huron, Kadoka, Kimball, Leola, Madison, Martin, Mission, Mobridge, North Sioux City, Piedmont, Pollock, Porcupine, Revillo, Sisseton, Tyndall, Valley Springs, Wakonda, Waubay, Webster, White River, Wilmot, Woonsocket, and Worthing. 
   I am pleased to note that NEA funds have been essential in helping to cultivate art on South Dakota's Native American Reservations. Federal funds have supported arts education at the Tiospa Zina Tribal School, the St. Joseph Indian School, the HVJ Lakota Cultural Center, Lower Brule Elementary School, and throughout the Wounded Knee School District. The Northern Plains Tribal Arts festival has also grown into the region's premiere Native American art show and market, in large part to NEA funding. 
   The total NEA budget amounts to one one-thousandth of one percent of the federal budget. I believe that this extremely modest investment in the NEA is overwhelmingly well spent, thanks to the leadership and creativity of those within the South Dakota arts community. While I am pleased that the Senate was able to once again fight off an attack on the NEA, I hope that we will soon be debating expansion of this federal-local-private partnership with a proven record of success in South Dakota.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Minnesota, extending strong support for his amendment. 
   Very simply, this amendment would require that when companies receive federally funded drug research or a federally owned drug, the benefits of that research or drug be made available to the public on reasonable terms through what is called a ``reasonable pricing clause.'' 
   This issue first surfaced during the Bush administration, in fact, when the NIH insisted that cooperative research agreements contain a reasonable pricing clause that would protect consumers from exorbitant prices of products developed from federally funded research. 
   Two weeks ago, during floor debate in the other body on the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill, a very similar amendment to this one was offered and overwhelmingly accepted by nearly three-quarters of the House of Representatives in a bipartisan vote. 
   The circumstances we face today are extraordinary. As an example, between 1955 and 1992, 92 percent of drugs approved by the FDA to treat cancer were researched and developed by the taxpayers through the NIH. Today many of the most widely used drugs in this country dealing with a variety of critical illnesses such as AIDS, breast cancer, and depression were developed through the use of taxpayer-funded NIH research. The Federal Government funds about 36 percent of all medical research. 
   The unfortunate scenario for American taxpayers is that oftentimes this drug research, done at their expense, is frequently used then by the pharmaceutical industry with no assurance that American consumers will not be charged outrageously high prescription drug prices. 
   Take the drug Taxol, for instance. The NIH spent 15 years and $32 million of our money, taxpayer money, to develop Taxol, which is a popular cancer drug used for breast, lung, and ovarian cancers. Following the development of Taxol, the drug manufacturer was awarded exclusive marketing rights on the drug, and Taxol is now priced at roughly 20 times what Taxol costs the manufacturer to produce. So a cancer patient on Taxol will pay $10,000 a year while it only costs the drug company $500. 
   As reported by Fortune 500 magazine earlier this year, the pharmaceutical companies once again represent the most profitable sector of the American economy. On top of that, we are seeing drug prices soaring at unimaginable rates year after year. In the United States, drug spending is growing at more than twice the rate of all other health care expenditures. Furthermore, Americans are paying far more for prescription drugs than do the people in any other Western industrialized Nation--many of these drugs manufactured in the United States and the research having been conducted through American taxpayer dollars. 
   As an example, tamoxifen, a widely prescribed drug for breast cancer, recently received federally funded research and numerous NIH-sponsored clinical trials. Yet today the pharmaceutical industry charges women in this Nation 10 times more than they charge women in Canada for a drug widely developed with U.S. taxpayer support. 
   The evidence has shown that the pharmaceutical companies are charging enormously high rates for drugs developed with the help of taxpayer money. Americans then are forced to pay twice 
   for lifesaving drugs: first as taxpayers to develop the drug, and then as a consumer to bolster pharmaceutical profits. Once again, who is hurt most by this? As one would expect, these costs fall hardest on those most vulnerable and least able to bear the burden, such as cancer patients, AIDS patients, and the elderly. 
   We have to put an end to the giveaway of billions of taxpayer dollars to finance drug research that goes on without any assurance whatsoever that the American taxpayers will not see a reasonable return on their investment in terms of affordable prescription drug prices. 
   I appreciate that this amendment may not be the silver bullet that solves all of the problems of assuring the American public they are receiving the return on their investment that they deserve. But it does serve as an important message that this Congress is here to protect the millions of American consumers who have invested their  money in research to develop drugs that they now cannot afford to buy. Furthermore, it shows we are here to fight for affordable prescription drugs for every American in this Nation. 
   This is one part of an overall strategy that this Congress needs to enact to assure that we have equity, to assure that we have tax fairness, and to assure that we maximize the number of people in America who can afford their prescriptions. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for passage of this critically important amendment tomorrow when the vote is taken on this amendment. I commend and applaud my colleague from Minnesota for his work in crafting this amendment and bringing it before the body.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I was absent from the Senate last Thursday afternoon to attend the high school graduation of my daughter. Kelsey. I missed two different votes, and I would like to state for the RECORD, how I would have voted in each instance. 
   I would have voted ``yes'' on rollcall vote number 141, the third reading of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act for the fiscal year 2001. 
   I would have voted ``yes'' on rollcall vote number 142, the motion to instruct the Sergeant at Arms during the consideration of HR 4577, the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2001. 
   I also was unavoidably detained due to a family commitment on the evening of June 27, and I missed one vote during that time. I would have voted ``yes'' on rollcall vote number 149, Senate amendment number 3610, a McCain amendment as amended to HR 4577, the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2001.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to amend the 1996 farm bill. This legislation is really the culmination of at least two years of work on the part of two agricultural producers from my home State of South Dakota. These two individuals, Craig Blindert of Salem and Phil Cyre of Watertown, have devoted an enormous amount of time and energy refining the proposal I am introducing today and I want to express my thanks and gratitude. 
   While some policy makers purport to have all the answers to agricultural policy and our current economic disaster in farm country, I am proud that two South Dakota farmers approached me with their plan. Mr. Blindert and Mr. Cyre exhibit a quality inherent to a farmer that most policy makers will never exhibit, something I call ``tractor seat common sense.'' Former President Eisenhower once said, farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and you're a thousand miles away from a farm. Instead of pretending I have all of the answers, I think it just makes good practical sense to listen to farmers who know their business better than anyone in the world, and that is what I have tried to do with this proposal. 
   Unfortunately, all of that expertise our farmers demonstrate about the production of crops and livestock, marketing, and risk management means little when our farm policy and agribusinesses minimizes them into mere price takers. The legislation I am introducing today attempts to allow farmers to become price setters in response to the free market, and it attempts to ensure responsibility from agribusiness to finally offer a decent price for commodities. 
   The current economic setting and commodity price forecast for farmers and ranchers remains disastrous. Crop prices have absolutely collapsed with corn prices at a 12 year low, soybeans prices at a 27 year low, and wheat prices that have not been so low since 1977. Meatpacker concentration and unfair livestock dumping are still crippling livestock producers. Prices paid for livestock have remained low in the pork and lamb sectors while they have  recovered, at a very limited and still unprofitable rate, for cattle producers. As a result, net farm income has plummeted to around $40 billion this past year, plunging $9 billion from last year, without government assistance. Agricultural exports are down over $11 billion from 1996, and constricted global demand for our agricultural products restricts exports from boosting prices. 
   It is clear that once again this disastrous marketplace clouds the landscape of rural America as a woefully inadequate farm bill continues to rip the safety net from beneath farmers and ranchers. If not for government market loss assistance the last three years--a record level of $23 billion in 1999--many hard-working farmers and ranchers might be out of business. 
   The course of the last few years under the current farm bill has given all of us the opportunity to measure the theories of Freedom to Farm against the practical reality of experience. The measurable results of that practical experience should convince Congress we cannot delay to reform the current farm bill. Some tend to ignore this reality, choosing instead to overlook the flawed farm policy, in hopes that over time our nation's family farmers and ranchers will find themselves enjoying the prosperity of our booming economy. However, most farmers merely read about this prosperity as they face escalating production expenses, eroding equity, and collapsing crop prices. 
   Delay in reforming farm policy is dangerous to the entire fabric of rural America. The other day a farmer remarked to me, ``the best time for Congress to write a better farm bill would have been in 1996, but, the next best time is today.'' I couldn't agree more. 
   Congress cannot continue to overlook the link between the current financial stress our family producers face and the 1996 farm bill provisions which eliminated the financial safety net for farmers. Consequently, there should be no higher priority for this Congress to accomplish in farm policy than to restore a fair price from a truly free marketplace. 
   The legislation I am introducing today is not a radical departure from the current farm bill. We try to reinforce the advantages of Freedom to Farm while improving upon other areas of our farm policy. Coined ``Flexible Fallow'' by the farmers who developed it, my proposal adds a voluntary, annual, conservation-use feature to the loan rate provisions of the 1996 Farm Bill. Should a farmer desire to operate under current farm bill conditions, my legislation ensures that opportunity. However, should a farmer need greater leverage over crop production and marketing, Flex Fallow guarantees that planting and marketing flexibility. 
   Neil Harl of Iowa State University, arguably the most respected agricultural economist in the country, has enthusiastically endorsed my Flex Fallow proposal. In a letter to me he describes Flex Fallow as ``the missing link to the 1996 farm bill.'' He believes this proposal will function in a market oriented fashion and ensure that ``farmers continue to make production decisions based upon their own operations in a manner that makes economic sense.'' 
   Mr. President, farmers electing to devote a portion of their total crop acreage to conservation-use under my bill receive a higher loan rate on their remaining crop production. On an annual and crop-by-crop basis, farmers can choose to conserve up to thirty percent of their total crop acreage. 
   An adjustable loan rate schedule is a key feature of this proposal. With the exception of wheat and soybeans, the proposed base loan rates for 0 percent participation in Flex Fallow (otherwise known as full production) are set at 2000 levels. Participation in Flex Fallow is directly proportional to increased loan rates. For corn, wheat, and soybeans, loan rates increase by one percent for each one percent increase in conservation-use. 
   In 1999, the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) completed an analysis of the Flex Fallow proposal. I believe the results were very promising. In years and regions (areas of the country with a wide basis) of low commodity prices, Flex Fallow encourages farmers to voluntarily set-aside land in turn for a higher loan rate. Yet in years of better commodity prices, farmers are inclined to produce for the market, planting most or all of their land to crop production. The reduced plantings in years of poor crop prices, like the last three years, would lead to higher crop prices. More specifically, reduced plantings in the first two years of the program would translate into the following higher crop prices. Corn prices rise 27 cents per bushel over current levels, soybean prices climb 44 cents per bushel, wheat prices recover 29 cents per bushel, and cotton prices rise 9 cents per pound. The FAPRI analysis predicts a commodity price recovery in the long-term, and the analysis found participation in Flex Fallow to decline after 2002. 
   While I work on this amendment to the current farm bill, I am absolutely open to other ideas and alternatives that revise our farm policy. Unlike the authors of the 1996 farm bill, I do not cling to a pride in authorship in a farm program. So, I want the opportunity to support as many viable alternatives as possible. 
   In summary, here are a few highlights of the Flex Fallow farm bill amendment I am introducing today. Flex Fallow is flexible and adjustable enough to meet the needs of individual farm operations. Flex Fallow is voluntary. Flex Fallow is market-oriented because it permits farmers the freedom to plant for marketplace conditions. Flex Fallow emphasizes conservation practices. Flex Fallow updates yield data and eliminates current base acres. Flex Fallow targets disaster assistance to producers who suffer from weather-related crop loss and price collapse. Finally, Flex Fallow will result in a modest cost to taxpayers. The FAPRI analysis finds net Commodity Credit Corporation expenditures under Flex Fallow to compare with that of the 1996 farm bill without billion-dollar emergency spending additions. 
   In the coming months I anticipate a full airing of my Flex Fallow amendment to the farm bill, alongside other pieces of farm bill reform legislation that others in Congress may introduce. I expect to refine this proposal after discussing it further with farmers and farm organizations across South Dakota and the entire country. As a result, it is likely I will introduce another piece of legislation similar to Flex Fallow in the next session of Congress, wherein two other significant issues will be addressed. 
   First, of critical importance to me is the need to design a farm bill in the future that targets the benefits to family-sized farmers and ranchers. Too often, Congress and the Administration devise tactics to ignore and plow under the existing farm program payment limitations. If we have a limited amount of taxpayer funds in which to devote to price support for farmers, it simply makes sense to target those benefits to small and mid-sized family producers. While the amendment I introduce today does not alter current payments limits under the farm bill, I am a strong supporter of targeting. As such, I will work to place sensible, responsible, payment limitations that provide benefits to all but ensure targeted benefits to the small and mid-sized family farmers and ranchers who need and deserve greater attention from Congress. 
   Second, I believe Congress will be unable to develop a future farm bill without the support of those in the conservation and wildlife community. I am a strong supporter of conservation programs that protect sensitive soil and water resources, promote wildlife habitat, and provide farmers and landowners with benefits and incentives to conserve land. Flex Fallow can work very well with both short-term and longer-term conservation practices. It is my goal to bring conservation groups together with farm interests in order to develop a well-balanced approach to future farm policy that protects our resources while promoting family-farm agriculture.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, domestic violence is often the crime that victims don't want to admit and communities don't want to discuss. However, almost 10,000 domestic violence victims in South Dakota last year got help from the Department of Social Services. This represents a low estimate of the number of South Dakotans who are victims of domestic violence as many victims fail to seek help. 
   Since enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, the number of forcible rapes of women declined, and the number of sexual assaults nationwide has gone down as well. Despite the success of the Violence Against Women Act, domestic abuse and violence against women continues to plague our communities. Consider  the fact that a woman is raped every five minutes in this country, and that nearly one in every three adult women experiences at least one physical assault by a partner during adulthood. In fact, more women are injured by domestic violence each year than by automobile accidents and cancer deaths combined. 
   These facts illustrate that there is a need in Congress to help states and communities address this problem that impacts all of our communities. 
   I recently joined Senator JOE BIDEN (D-DE), Senator ORRIN HATCH (R-UT), Senator TOM DASCHLE (D-SD), and others in sponsoring bipartisan legislation, S. 2787, to reauthorize the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. Authorization for the important programs contained in this law has already expired, and Congress must act now to ensure that successful programs dealing with domestic violence are funded in the future. 
   As a state lawmaker in 1983, I wrote one of the first domestic violence laws in South Dakota which dedicated a portion of marriage license fees to help build shelters for battered women. I was also a cosponsor of the original Violence Against Women Act in 1990 in the House of Representatives. Even at that time, many people denied that domestic violence existed in our state. Finally, in 1995, the President signed legislation to strengthen federal criminal law relating to violence against women and fund programs to help women who have been assaulted. 
   Since the Violence Against Women Act became law, South Dakota organizations have received over $6.7 million in federal funding for domestic abuse programs. In addition, the Violence Against Women Act doubled prison time for repeat sex offenders; established mandatory restitution to victims of violence against women; codified much of our existing laws on rape; and strengthened interstate enforcement of violent crimes against women. 
   The law also created a national toll-free hotline to provide women with crisis intervention help, information about violence against women, and free referrals to local services. Last year, the hotline took its 300,000th call. The number for women to call for help is: 1-800-799-SAFE. 
   In addition to reauthorizing the provisions of the original Violence Against Women Act, the legislation that I am sponsoring in the Senate would improve our overall efforts to reduce violence against women by strengthening law enforcement's role in reducing violence against women. The legislation also expands legal services and assistance to victims of violence, while also addressing the effects of domestic violence on children. Finally, programs are funded to strengthen education and training to combat violence against women. 
   I have asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to quickly pass S. 2787, and I am hopeful that the Senate will approve this important piece of legislation this year so that we can continue fighting domestic abuse and violence against women in our state and communities.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I supported the amendment to create a Medicare prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program offered by my colleague, Senator ROBB from Virginia, to the Labor, Health and Human Resources and Education Appropriations bill. 
   Despite the Senate defeating this amendment largely along a party line vote of 44 to 53, I vow to continue the fight with my colleagues to push the Senate for further debate on prescription drug proposals and pass a meaningful prescription drug bill this year. The millions of needy seniors and those with disabilities receiving Medicare deserve nothing less. 
   Some of my colleagues have argued that this was not the time, nor the proper legislative process by which we should pass a Medicare prescription drug proposal. Mr response to that accusation, is when is the proper time then? When are we in Congress going to listen to the constituents like those that I have spoken to from Wessington Springs and Custer, South Dakota? This is not, nor should be a partisan issue. This is not, nor should be an issue that gives greater deliberation to the pleas of party politics than pleas of needy seniors. 
   Constituents in my home state of South Dakota, have been telling me for years that they are struggling to make ends meet and need help affording their prescription drugs. I introduced my first bill on this issue well over a year ago in the Senate, and since then debate surrounding how to provide Medicare beneficiaries with access to affordable prescription drugs has produced several proposals from both Democrats and Republicans. 
   Yet, this is the first time that the Senate has taken the time during the 106th Congress to have a floor vote on this issue. I am cautiously optimistic that we will continue to see debate on this critically important matter, and may indeed find compromise between the two parties to help our senior citizens better afford their expensive prescription drug medications. 
   I am in constant contact with South Dakotans who have expressed their difficulty in choosing between paying for medication, or buying food and paying  utilities. I want to assure them that the Senate will not wait any longer and will pass legislation this session to provide immediate relief to the thousands of senior citizens in South Dakota and across the nation who are having difficulty affording life-saving medication. 
   Even if we can't reach an agreement on a Medicare prescription drug plan this year, there are several steps we can take now that would provide some relief to seniors who face rising prescription drug costs. All three of the bills that I have sponsored, including the Prescription Drug Fairness For Seniors Act, the International Prescription Drug Parity Act, and the Generic Pharmaceutical Access and Choice For Consumers Act, if enacted this year, would provide immediate relief to millions of Americans across the country. Equally so, these bills would require no additional taxpayer dollars nor new government program.'' 
   While they may not be the magic bullet that meets all of the long term needs of providing Medicare prescription drug coverage, they would provide a mechanism for immediate relief from rising drug costs. Working together, reaching across the aisle, we can use this time of unparalleled prosperity to do the right thing by our seniors. We should do it this year for their sake, and for the sake of the future of Medicare.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today to support introduction of the Health Care Access and Rural Equality Act of 2000, known as H-CARE. 
   I especially want to commend Senators CONRAD and GRASSLEY, and Representative FOLEY for the tremendous amount of effort they put forth in drafting this key legislation. As well, I commend a number of my other colleagues who have contributed immensely to the crafting of this bill, including Senators DASCHLE, HARKIN, ROBERTS, THOMAS, KERREY, ROCKEFELLER, and Representatives POMEROY, TANNER, NUSSLE, and MCINTYRE. 
   The bipartisan and bicameral support for this legislation signifies the critical and often times desperate condition, that our rural hospitals are in due in large part to the unforeseen impact of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 and disparities in Medicare reimbursements for rural facilities. 
   Impact estimates and preliminary data suggest that the BBA cuts have fallen squarely on the shoulders of our rural hospitals who do not have the operating margins to shoulder consecutive years of budgetary deficits. Unfortunately, rural hospitals do not have the luxury of trimming spending in one area to meet the needs in another. Recent cuts have forced hospitals to eliminate important programs such as home health care or therapy services in order to operate within these tight budget restraints. 
   Rural hospitals are charged with the responsibility to provide high-quality, compassionate care to individuals in times of need, especially our senior and disabled Medicare populations. However, it also seems evident to me that we have asked hospitals to do a day's work for an hour's pay. 
   The H-CARE Act works to restore some of the funding disparities that exist for rural hospitals and provides resources to ensure their survival. 
   Hospitals in my home state of South Dakota face a potential loss in Medicare revenues of nearly $171 million over five years if something is not done to help them. 
   Provisions in H-CARE including inflation updates for rural hospitals, protection for Medicare Dependent Hospitals, support for the Critical Access Hospitals Programs, creation of a capital infrastructure loan program, assistance to update technology, and increased reimbursement for Sole Community Hospitals will allow rural facilities the necessary resources to keep their doors open. 
   We are talking about rural facilities such as the Medical Center in Huron, SD, which was forced to eliminate 24 full time positions to compensate for Medicare cuts in their FY 2001 budget, or the hospital in Burke, SD, which had to cut $124,000 from their hospital this year to ensure their survival. These are just a few examples of the many stories that I've heard from hospitals administrators throughout my home state of South Dakota. 
   Once again, I am please to join my colleagues today as an original cosponsor of the H-CARE Act and look forward to working with the full Senate to ensure quick and immediate action on this critically important legislation.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr President, I rise on the floor of the Senate today to introduce bipartisan legislation to extend a popular program which provides mediation services between agricultural producers and the various credit and United States Department of Agriculture agencies who family farmers and ranchers work with to maintain their operations. 
   During the 1980's farm crisis, Congress authorized federal participation in a state farm mediation program. Originally authorized in the Agriculture Credit Act of 1987, mediation programs help agricultural producers and their creditors to resolve credit disputes (and other types of disputes) in a confidential and non-adversarial setting which is outside the traditional process of litigation, appeals, bankruptcy, and foreclosure. 
   The mediators are neutral facilitators and they do not make decisions for the disputing parties. 
   Federal legislation has encouraged state involvement by providing matching grant funds to the states that participate in the mediation program. Currently, 24 states participate, including Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 
   Beyond the scope of agricultural credit-related mediation, the program aims to resolve disputes such as wetland determinations, grazing issues, and USDA program compliance, and other issues the Secretary of Agriculture deems appropriate. 
   Each year, Congress seeks to provide funding for the mediation program through the Agriculture Appropriations process. This year $3 million has been appropriated for this program in both the House and Senate Agriculture Appropriation bills. This legislation will not change the fact that Congress must go through the Appropriations process each year to secure funding for this program. 
   The legislation my colleagues and I are introducing today reauthorizes the mediation program by eliminating the sunset clause (set to expire in FY 2000), clarifies that funds appropriated by Congress to the mediation program must be used for farm credit cases (including USDA direct and guaranteed loans and loans from commercial entities) and may be used for other USDA program disputes, and clarifies that mediation services can include counseling services to prepare parties to a dispute prior to mediation. 
   In a time when family farmers and ranchers continue to deal with low prices and suffer under more and more vertical integration, I believe we must begin to reflect on what we can do to maintain the independent family farms and ranches that our country depends on for our food supply. We live in a day and age where nearly every farm and ranch operation must secure credit in order to pay production expenditures necessary to stay in business. This mediation program is supported by both  sides of the aisle and allows farmers and ranchers to settle their credit and farm program disputes in a fair way without digging themselves into legal debt. 
   I have worked with the lone Congressman from my home state of South Dakota in drafting this legislation and the same bill will be introduced in the House of Representatives today as well. 
   I urge my colleagues of the Senate to join me in supporting this bi-partisan legislation with the goal of moving it through the legislative process quickly in order to continue to provide these services to our American farmers and ranchers. 
   By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself, Mr ABRAHAM, Mr. ASHCROFT, Mr. BURNS, Mr. SANTORUM, Mr. GORTON, Mrs. HUTCHISON, Mr. ALLARD, Mr. BENNETT, Mr. COVERDELL, Mr. GREGG, Mr. HELMS, Mr. THOMAS, Mr. INHOFE, Mr. MACK, Mr. WARNER, Mr. BUNNING, Mr. LOTT, Mr. MCCONNELL, Mr. CRAPO, and Mr. ROBERTS):

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment I filed this past week to H.R. 3709, the Internet Nondiscrimination Act. This amendment has a twofold purpose. First, it highlights the need to act on S. 2097, the Launching Our Communities' Access to Local Television Act of 2000. This critical legislation passed the Senate by a unanimous, 97-0, vote on March 30 of this year. The House version of this bill, H.R. 3615, also passed by an overwhelming 375-37 margin. Yet here we are 2 1/2 months later with no effort to move this bipartisan legislation forward toward enactment. 
   In the meantime, the other body has considered an extension of the Internet tax moratorium for an additional 5 years. I supported the original Internet Nondiscrimination Act which created a 3-year moratorium on new taxes on the Internet while we considered the various ramifications of e-commerce taxation issues. 
   That original moratorium does not expire until next October. Yet here we are 16 months in advance of that expiration preparing to consider an additional 5-year expansion. Not only that, but with this new legislation, we renege, frankly, on a promise made under the 1998 act which grandfathered existing State taxes on Internet services. That agreement was essential to securing the overwhelming support which S. 442 ultimately received. 
   I believe we should not be placing taxes on access to the Internet, but that is not the issue. The issue is the implementation of already existing sales tax responsibilities. Sales tax is a critical component of State and local revenues, especially in States such as South Dakota that do not have an income tax. More than half of our State budget derives from the sales tax. That is the money that goes to education,  crimefighting, and other essential services. This online-commerce loophole in sales tax collection results in an unfair situation for South Dakota merchants, and threatens the treasuries of State and local governments with the loss of millions of dollars in revenue. There is a great need for State tax laws to be applied to all sales regardless of whether the sales are made at a local store, over the Internet, or by any other means. 
   H.R. 3709 does not foreclose the possibility of collecting sales tax on products purchased over the Internet. In fact, it is silent on this issue. That silence, however, is almost as dangerous to State and local government as an explicit rejection of equal treatment for brick and mortar stores. By filing this amendment to H.R. 3709, I want it made clear that I will oppose this legislation moving forward until it establishes a comprehensive review of Internet-related tax policy. 
   I remain absolutely opposed to any new tax on the Internet. Internet usage ought to be encouaged and kept affordable. Public policy ought to promote tax-free Internet access, but it makes no sense that some sales are subject to sales tax while others are not. We need a level playing field for everyone. It is up to each individual State and municipality to decide for itself whether it wants to have a sales tax--but once that decision is made, it ought to apply uniformly to sales without regard to the particular technology utilized in making the sale. This correction must be considered in the context of any effort to extend the ongoing Internet tax moratorium. 
   Although there are many pieces of critical legislation which would serve to highlight the tax fairness issues raised by H.R. 3709, I want to focus on S. 2097, the local-into-local television act. 
   Under legislation we passed this past year, satellite companies are for the first time free to broadcast local network programming into local markets. That ability has already benefited thousands of viewers and promoted competition in the broadcast delivery industry. What S. 2097 seeks to accomplish is to make that benefit a reality for Americans who live outside the largest 40 television markets. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I represent a State, South Dakota, with rural viewers that should not be left out of the information age. South Dakota is one of the 16 States that do not have a single city among the top 70 markets. Sixteen States have no television markets within the top 70. Without this loan guarantee, markets such as Sioux Falls and Rapid City will never get local-into-local service, and rural South Dakotans will not have an opportunity to receive their local networks over the satellite signals. 
   This proposal is more than just getting sports or entertainment programming over your local channels. It is a critical way to receive important local news, storm information, road reports, school closing information, and civic affairs information. 
   Rural Americans need the same opportunity to access their local networks as do our urban friends. This legislation will provide that opportunity. 
   We have worked very hard in the Banking Committee and on the floor to achieve strong bipartisan legislation. Senators SARBANES, BAUCUS, GRAMM, BURNS, and others worked diligently to find the accommodations to satisfy everyone's concerns. We have a final product which will ultimately result in local-into-local broadcasting for rural America, and it does so in a fiscally responsible manner that limits the taxpayer exposure. 
   The overwhelming vote in both the House and Senate demonstrates the soundness of this legislation. It is absolutely critical for the millions of Americans who live outside our major urban areas. It is the promised missing component of last year's Satellite Home Viewer Improvements Act. 
   This issue has aroused the greatest level of constituent concern in many States in quite some time. S. 2097 provides a fiscally responsible and prudent response to the concerns raised by thousands of our constituents, protecting the taxpayer interests while at the same time helping to provide this service. I intend to offer this legislation to every vehicle possible this year until we have the opportunity to finish what we started and provide this essential service to all Americans. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators MCCAIN, BINGAMAN, MURRAY, REID, and JEFFORDS in offering an amendment dealing with military retiree health care. I first want to thank Senators WARNER and LEVIN for their continued hard work in the Armed Services Committee in attempting to address this critical and urgent issue. 
   Last year, the Senate began to address critical recruitment and retention problems currently facing our nation's armed services. The pay table adjustments and retirement reform enacted with my support in the fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense authorization bill were, frankly, long overdue improvements for our active duty military personnel. 
   However, these improvements did not solve our country's difficulty in recruiting and keeping the best and the brightest in the military. In order to maintain a strong military for now and in the future, our country must show that it will honor its commitment to military retirees and veterans as well. 
   Too often, military health care is treated as an afterthought rather than a priority. That's why on the first day of this legislative year, I introduced the Keep our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act, S. 2003. This legislation currently has 32 bipartisan cosponsors including 18 Republicans and 14 Democrats. 
   Companion legislation in the House has over 300 bipartisan cosponsors. The bill also has the strong support of military retirees across the country and organizations including the Retired Enlisted Association, the Retired Officers Association, the National Association of Uniformed Services, and the Disabled American Veterans. 
   The amendment I offer today is the same language as that contained in S. 2003. This legislation honors our nation's commitment to the men and women who served in the military by keeping our Nation's promise of health care coverage in return for their service and selfless dedication. 
   In doing so, it also illustrates to active duty men and women that our country will not abandon them when their military career ends. 
   Our country must honor its commitments to military retirees and veterans, not only because it's the right thing to do, but also because it's the smart thing to do. 
   We all know the history: For decades, men and women who joined the military were promised lifetime health care coverage for themselves and their families. They were told, in effect, if you disrupt your family, if you work for low pay, if you endanger your life and limb, we will in turn guarantee lifetime health benefits. 
   Testimony from military recruiters themselves, along with copies of recruitment literature dating back to World War II, show that health care was promised to active duty personnel and their families upon the personnel's retirement. 
   In fact, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Henry Shelton, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee and said:  
   Sir, I think the first thing we need to do is make sure that we acknowledge our commitment to the retirees for their years of service and for what we basically committed to at the time that they were recruited into the armed forces.  
   Defense Secretary William Cohen also testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee and said:  
   We have made a pledge, whether it's legal or not, it's a moral obligation that we will take care of all of those who served, retired veterans and their families, and we have not done so.  
   Prior to June 7, 1956, no statutory health care plan existed for military personnel, and the coverage which eventually followed was dependent upon the space available at military treatment facilities. 
   Post-cold war downsizing, base closures, and the reduction of health care services at military bases have limited the health care options available to military retirees. 
   That's right: Many of the people who helped us win the cold war have lost their health care because the cold war ended. 
   Some military retirees in South Dakota and other rural states are forced to drive hundreds of miles to receive care. Furthermore, military retirees are currently kicked off the military's TRICARE health care system when they turn 65. 
   This is a slap in the face to those men and women who have sacrificed their livelihood to keep our country safe from threats at home and abroad. 
   My amendment honors the promise of lifetime health care coverage. It does so in two ways:  
   First, it allows military retirees who entered the armed services before June 7, 1956 (the date military health care for retirees was enacted into law) to enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), with the United States paying 100 percent of the costs. 
   Second, military retirees who joined the armed services after space-available care was enacted into law on June 7, 1956 would be allowed to enroll in FEHBP or continue to participate in TRICARE--even after they turn 65. Military retirees who choose to enroll in FEHBP will pay the same premiums and fees--and receive access to the same health care coverage--as other Federal employees. 
   In my own family, my oldest son is in the Army and currently serves as a sergeant in Kosovo. I fully appreciate what inadequate health care and broken promises can do to the morale of military families. 
   This stress on morale not only effects the preparedness of our military units, but also discourages some of our most able personnel from reenlisting, making recruitment efforts more difficult. 
   I have long contended that all the weapons and training upgrades in the world will be rendered ineffective if military personnel and their families are not afforded a good ``quality of life'' in our nation's armed forces. I have been a strong advocate of better funding for veterans health care, military pay, active duty health care, education and housing. 
   The Johnson amendment continues these efforts led by Senator WARNER, Senator LEVIN, and others to address these important quality of life issues. 
   Senator WARNER's modified amendment incorporates an important part of S. 2003--the extension of TRICARE to Medicare-eligible retirees and dependents. I applaud the Senator for his work. 
   However, only my amendment fulfills the promise of health care for military retirees while illustrating to current active duty personnel that our country supports its commitments to men and women in the military. 
   I am also concerned that Senator WARNER's modified amendment terminates in 2004. This could leave military retirees once again wondering where their health care will come from. The Johnson amendment does not terminate. 
   I understand the rationale for Senator WARNER's amendment. I am going to support the amendment of Senator WARNER. It is a good-faith effort to do the best that can be done on the health care issues, within the context of the budgetary marching orders that have been imposed on Senator WARNER's committee. I understand that. I understand he is doing the best he can within the fiscal envolope that he has been afforded. 
   But it frustrates me, as I know it frustrates tens of thousands of military retiree and active duty personnel, that for years and years we have been told: Yes, we know we have a commitment to you for health care but we can't afford it. The Nation's budget is in the red. We are running deficits. We simply cannot afford to live up to those promises. 
   That was never entirely true. In fact, in the context of a $1.5 trillion budget, we could have reoriented priorities, I believe, in such a way that we could have kept our promises to military personnel and retirees. But there was an element of truth to the fact that we were running red ink and we were running massive deficits. 
   Those days are gone for a lot of different reasons. We have had much debate on this floor as to why we now find ourselves running significant budget surpluses over and above that attributable to Social Security and why those surpluses, projected out 10 years from now, will run in the $3 trillion range, some $700 billion to $1 trillion over and above what is required for Social Security because we are certainly in agreement we are not going to dip into anything that is attributable to Social Security. That is off the table, and rightfully so. There is the question about what will we do with the $700 billion to $1 trillion budget surplus that is being projected by both the White House and by the congressional budget experts. 
   The amendment pending is an expensive amendment. I understand that. It could run around $3 billion next year and $9 billion a year after that, according to our friends at the Congressional Budget Office. That is a significant expense. What I am asking is if this is not a time when we can afford to live up to our promises to our military retirees and our military personnel, then when will that time ever occur? 
   There are those who see other uses for that $700 billion to $1 trillion surplus over and above Social Security. I have other things I would like to do as well, including some tax relief. There are those who want tax relief in the range of essentially the entire surplus. I am suggesting there is room for tax relief, there is room for paying down the debt, there is room for education, and a number of other things. If we do this right, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to utilize some of that projected surplus to, in fact, finally--finally--live up to our commitment to our military personnel and 
   retirees, many of whom, frankly, have gone to their graves without the benefits they were promised. We do have that once-in-a-lifetime, unique opportunity this year to do something constructive, to make a commitment that we will fund this, not out of military readiness, not out of active duty budgets, but, in fact, out of this projected surplus that the CBO and OMB people tell us is headed our way. 
   Military retirees and veterans are our Nation's most effective recruiters. Unfortunately, poor health care options make it difficult for these men and women to encourage the younger generation to make a career of the military. In fact, in Rapid City, SD, which is outside of Ellsworth Air Force Base, a very significant B-1 military base in my State, I was talking to military personnel and talking to retirees who are as loyal and as patriotic, who have paid a price second to none for our Nation's liberty, and they told me: Senator, I can't in good faith tell my nephews, my children, young people whom I encounter, that they ought to serve in the U.S. military, that they ought to make a career of that service because I see what the Congress has done to its commitment to me, to my family, to my neighbors. The health care promises were never lived up to, and we don't think you ever will live up to them. You have no credibility with us. It has gone decades, it has gone generations, and you have not lived up to the health care obligations and responsibilities that you said, if we put our lives in danger, we would have. How can I in good faith tell these young people they ought to make a career of the military, that it is a distinguished professional option they ought to consider, when you treat us shabbily? 
   That is the message I hear from active duty as well as retired military personnel in my State. It is the same in the mail and e-mail I get from all across the country saying: 2003 is the only legislative option we see that truly lives up to Congress' obligations. 
   No more excuses. The money is there. The only question is, Is the political will there? Is this a priority or is it not? I am pleased we are having this debate.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the Senator is exactly right. We have a problem both on the VA health care side and on the military retiree side; that is, those who have served their 20 years in the military and rely on TRICARE currently, previously CHAMPUS, for their health care needs in both instances. 
   These people who have served this Nation in such an extraordinary fashion have, in all too many instances, not received the quality, the accessibility, or the affordability of health care they deserve. It is doubly difficult in rural States, such as our own, but it is a problem everywhere. 
   It is suggested as a compromise that we simply extend TRICARE to those who are age 65 and older. That is an additional option which I applaud, but that does not extend the Federal Employees Health Benefits System to either people prior to 65 or older and, frankly, up until now, TRICARE is not viewed in my State with great enthusiasm by many of our military retirees. I understand it is a new program, and it may improve as time goes on. Simply doing that alone falls far short of living up to the obligations Congress made during times of war when we were not sure if our Republic was going to survive World War II, when we did not know what would happen and we called these people into service, followed with Korea, Vietnam, and other conflicts, with people dying for our liberty. We were quick to make promises at that time: If you help us out, if you work for almost nothing, disrupt your families and serve this Nation, we will provide you with quality health care. 
   They did their share. They came home and we said: Wait a minute, this is a little more costly than we thought, and we have decided to forget about it. 
   We are not going to live up to those obligations. That is what this Congress has said through administrations of both political parties over the years. 
   We have an opportunity now to bring that, at last, to a halt and to deal with our military retirees with a spark of integrity, at last. That is what this amendment is about.

   Mr. JOHNSON. I think the Senator from North Dakota raises an excellent point. He himself has been a champion for veterans and military retirees. 
   Obviously, when we come to the point of the VA-HUD appropriations issues, we will do the very best we can within the VA context, while at the same time trying to address the military retiree issues. They go hand in hand. They are both very much part and parcel of our overall effort towards military 
   recruitment, retention, and readiness. They are part of that same package. I certainly commend the Senator from North Dakota for his leadership in that regard.

   Mr. JOHNSON. The chairman, the Senator from Virginia, has a very constructive suggestion. I certainly will not put words in his mouth relative to the interpretation of his legislation. I applaud him for his legislative efforts. But I will draw some distinctions as to his pending amendment and my amendment. 
   I intend to vote for both amendments. My amendment is farther reaching and, as I am sure the distinguished Senator from Virginia would note, is more costly. Because of that, it runs into additional parliamentary issues perhaps. But I will attempt, in closing, to draw some distinctions between what it is we are trying to do.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Very good. 
   The opponents of S. 2003, in my amendment, again would claim that it simply costs too much; roughly $3 billion in fiscal year 2001, and, over 10 years, CBO estimates an average cost of $9 billion a year to fulfill our promise of health care for military retirees. This does not come cheaply. I am very up front on that fact. However, we are talking about a $200 billion budget surplus--$9 billion here; $200 billion surplus--$800 billion to $1 trillion over 10 years. That is a conservative estimate. 
   So if we look at the larger scheme of things, in terms of where this ought to be within our budget, and also with the possibility of some reprioritization of the existing budget, I believe the argument that we simply can no longer afford to live up to our promises to military personnel who sacrificed so much, including families of those who have died defending our right to be here debating this issue today, simply no longer holds. 
   We invest billions of dollars each year to build new weaponry, and rightfully so. But all the weapons in the world will be rendered useless or less useful without the men and women in uniform and without the high-quality, qualified personnel we need to operate them. 
   I believe a promise made should be a promise kept. We owe it to our country's military retirees to provide them  with the health care they were promised. The effort behind this amendment has been 100-percent driven by military retirees taking action on the benefits to which they are entitled. It is the right thing to do. No more tests; no more demonstration projects; no more experiments. 
   I think we need to act now on a program that works, building on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan system. On average, 3,784 military retirees are dying each month. The time to act is now. These retirees have mobilized in a grassroots lobbying campaign throughout the country to fight for lifetime health care. 
   I hope we do not leave this floor today without giving true access to health care to these soldiers, sailors, and airmen who have patriotically served our country. We have a long way to go. I will continue to work with Senators WARNER and LEVIN, and my colleagues, to be sure that our country's active-duty personnel, military retirees, and veterans receive the benefits they deserve. 
   Senator WARNER has suggested we draw some clear distinctions between the amendments. I think that is a very constructive suggestion. I am sure he will elaborate on the differences. 
   A difference, as I understand it, is that my amendment would allow those who retired before June 7, 1956, to have fully paid participation in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. That is the plan in which all Federal employees, including Members of this body, participate. Frankly, it is a very successful and very popular health system. Ask any Federal employee. They will tell you the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan is an excellent one. It provides every citizen with an option, a menu, from a ``Cadillac'' to lower-priced option, depending on how extravagant they feel in relation to their share of premiums in the health care plan. 
   For those who retired before 1956, we will say, if you want to continue to participate in TRICARE, you certainly can, but your other option is to move over to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, like other Federal employees and like your Senator. What is good for your Senator is good for you. 
   For those who retired after the magic date of June 7, 1956, we say, you, too, have the option of participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, or you can continue to use TRICARE. You will, however, pay premiums similar to what Federal employees pay. 
   It is not entirely free, but you will have this additional option, and you may continue to stay there post age 65 in retirement. 
   Our plan builds on utilization of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, fully premium paid for those older military personnel with premiums for the somewhat younger personnel, optional. And it is perpetual. This is not a pilot project. This is not an experiment. We will not take this away from you 2 years down the road because we ran out of money. This is a commitment. You have to decide what your retirement plans are. You have to plan for that. We don't want to be jerking the rug out from under you. We have a plan. It is there. You choose it, if you choose it. No more demonstration projects that apply to some parts of the country and not other parts or it is in for a couple years and then we will assess it and decide whether to continue it or not. We are not interested in that. 
   The Warner amendment, which I think is certainly a step ahead of where we are now, does move the health care benefits down the road in a constructive way. I applaud the Senator for that. But as I understand the Senator's amendment, it essentially allows those who are 65 and older, rather than to be pushed out of TRICARE on to Medicare, to continue their participation in TRICARE health care services post 65. That is an additional option. I am all for options. I think that is a good thing. 
   It does cost some money. Senator WARNER's amendment does fit within the current budget resolution, but in order to get it within the budget resolution, it would terminate in 2004. It may be, if this is successful, there will be additional revenue, and maybe we will continue it post-2004. But there is no certainty to that within the legislation. It fits within the current budget resolution because it has been chopped short in fiscal year 2004. So while TRICARE works better for some people than for others, it has not worked terribly well in my home State. My State is a rural State, which may be a bit different. Trying to make managed care work in my State is a little more difficult than it might be in other areas. I certainly concede that. But in my area, even if we gave people a continued TRICARE option, I am not sure they would beat a path to it particularly. Some may. Again, I certainly applaud the option. 
   That is the basic difference between Senator WARNER's amendment, which is constructive and does give an additional option to those who are post 65, and my plan, which builds on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, applies both to pre-56 and post-56--pre-56 with premiums paid--and on into retirement, and gives people those options. 
   Frankly, most people I talked to, if they had a choice between TRICARE and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, they would run as fast as they can go to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, the plan their Senators and Congressman have, and, for that matter, all Federal employees in their hometown have. 
   As I see it, put very shortly and perhaps not with as much detail towards the plan of the senior Senator from Virginia, that is the basic difference from which we have to choose. They are not inconsistent necessarily, but I do believe that 2003 is a far, far more expansive and permanent approach to the urgent crisis we have for military retiree health care. 
   The distinguished Senator from Virginia has suggested that he may want to comment at this stage on his amendment. I think it is appropriate that we discuss both of them in this context. 
   Mr. President, I renew my request for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. JOHNSON. If the Senator will yield on that point, apart from the fact that the military retiree organizations themselves are telling us in no uncertain terms that they prefer the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan coverage, I think the following points need to be made. First, relative to this 66,000 test program, there was, in fact, I am told, a lack of timely delivery of accurate, comprehensive information about the Federal Employees Health Benefits Test Program. Some of those surveyed claimed that townhall meetings sponsored by the Department of Defense to promote the test were poorly planned and publicized. Many retirees noted the inability to get accurate information and forms from the Department of Defense call center. 
   Frankly, there has been a fear of the unknown with the test program. Retirees are being asked to change health programs for a test program that ends in 2002. Many retirees are worried they would have to simply change back at the end of the test period. One retiree responded to the military coalition survey by saying, ``I just could not risk having to try to get insurance at age 73 should the demonstration fail to be renewed.'' That may have been a misperception, but it was one that skewed the results of the 66,000-member test. There is no doubt about that.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I make a clarification relative to my amendment. There may have been some confusion earlier. I wish to make it very clear that under my amendment those who entered the armed services prior to June 7, 1956, would be eligible for Federal employee health benefit plan coverage with the Government paying 100 percent of the premiums. Those who entered the armed services after June 7 of 1956 can choose Federal employee health benefit plans with premiums or TRICARE. I want to make sure that point is very clear. 
   There has been reference to points of order, and the Senator from Virginia is very correct that a point of order will be raised on my amendment. My amendment does cost more. It does more and it costs more. It is perpetuating. It is not a 2-year commitment. 
   A point of order, while not taken up lightly, is simply an opportunity to determine whether 60 votes in this body believe the issue at hand is of sufficient importance that it ought to have that first level of concern, that priority. 
   The question is, Are we going to pass or waive a point of order with 60 votes and invade surplus dollars that otherwise are available for tax cuts or are we going to put our money where our mouth is? Do we have the 60 votes to say we will use those dollars, at least that part of it that is required, that $90 billion out of the $800 billion or so that is available, for this purpose? 
   One of the things that makes this debate interesting, and the parliamentary process interesting, I don't know if we have the 60 votes to waive the order or not. After all these years of Veterans Day and Memorial Day rhetoric about how important 
   our veterans are, this at last will be an opportunity for every Member of this body to stand up and be counted. Is that rhetorical support or are you willing to put these priorities ahead of other budget priorities, including tax relief? Are you willing to waive the Budget Act and make this happen or not? If you are not, I respect your views. Members can go home and explain that. That is certainly your prerogative. 
   It is long overdue. We have an opportunity for some accountability for the American public to understand who is willing to truly make this a budget priority and who is not. If you are not, then you have those justifications that you can make. That is what the nature of this is. This is not because it is more costly, that this is an impossible program. It will require 60 votes, assuming that the point of order is raised, rather than the 50 votes of the Senator from Virginia. 
   It will allow the Senate to make a determination in this body whether these priorities are ahead of other priorities that people have, a thousand other things for which they want to use the budget surpluses. No doubt almost all of them are worthy causes. But is this only one of many, many causes, one that we are going to cut short after only 2 years, and then provide less than the full level of commitment to the promises made to our veterans or is this, in fact, a first priority and we are complying with our promises, albeit belatedly, but a full commitment permanently, and in order to do that invade into surpluses dollars that no doubt other people on both sides of the aisle have other purposes for which they can use the dollars? That is the question with which ultimately we have to contend. 
   My colleague from New York has come to the floor and has a 1 minute request on an unrelated issue. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from New York be permitted 1 minute.

We have a fundamental question before us, and that is whether the military retirees of this Nation deserve to have the same kind of health care system that Members of this body have, or other Federal employees, through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. That is the amendment that the military retiree organizations are asking to have and we can, once and for all, be done with the question about whether we are going to live up to our commitment to our military personnel in terms of the medical care that they were promised and which they deserve. 
   I think there is an across-the-board agreement in this body that if we are truly going to live up to this obligation, this legislation is what we have to pass. It would involve a waiver, and the fundamental question we have, then, is whether we have 60 votes in this body to get into the surplus dollars, or whether those surplus dollars will remain available for tax cuts and other purposes. 
   If you believe that military health care is a first priority, ought to come first, rather than the crumbs that come after we have made other budget decisions, you will support the Johnson-McCain amendment.

I am equally pleased to support economic and disaster assistance attached to H.R. 2259 not because I believe the assistance will always be targeted to those that need it most, but rather because Congress cannot afford to ignore the opportunity to act now in order to provide timely relief to our nation's family farmers and ranchers. 
   Collapsed crop and livestock prices, weak export demand, and agribusiness concentration continue to threaten the viability of our independent family farmers and ranchers. Crop insurance provides many agricultural producers with a risk management tool, and with the reforms made in the legislation before us today, crop insurance will prove even more effective. 
   Nonetheless, I must caution that no matter how well crop insurance is improved, it is not a substitute for a sound farm policy or a safety net. Instead, crop insurance is an important part of that farm safety net. Moreover, the economic and disaster farm aid attached to this legislation will help in the near-term, but for the third year in a row this Congress has failed to address the underlying shortcomings of the current farm bill. 
   Crop insurance is critical to the farmers of South Dakota. Nearly twenty South Dakota grown crops are currently eligible for crop insurance, and among our major commodities, participation in the crop insurance program is high. Ninety-five percent of our corn acreage is enrolled in crop insurance while ninety two percent of our soybean acres are in this program. Wheat producers in South Dakota place seventy-six percent of their acreage in crop insurance. After the reforms made to the program in 1994--when I chaired the House Agriculture Subcommittee dealing with this issue--over 10 million acres of farmland in my state were enrolled in crop insurance. 
   I was pleased to co-sponsor a bipartisan reform bill that is a modification of S. 1580, the Kerrey-Roberts Crop Insurance for the 21st Century Act. The conference report before the Senate today closely mirrors the Kerrey/Roberts legislation and addresses some of the most serious concerns of the current crop insurance program; affordability, dependability, and flexibility. 
   Nearly every agricultural producer wants the opportunity to purchase higher levels of crop insurance coverage, but most have found that buy-up coverage becomes cost prohibitive. This bill makes coverage more affordability by providing higher subsidies for higher levels of coverage. South Dakota farmers support this provision of our bill because affordability seems to be the most pressing issue facing crop insurance today. 
   In recent years, the issue of coverage dependability has come into serious question. Farmers in South Dakota and elsewhere have suffered under multiple years of weather related disasters. The bill before us today ensures greater coverage dependability by providing relief for producers suffering from insurance coverage decreases and premium increases due to multi-year crop losses resulting from natural disasters. 
   The conference report authorizes USDA to conduct a series of pilot programs to provide risk management protection to livestock producers, I am hopeful livestock producers can stand to benefit from this action because to date they have been specifically excluded from this protection. 
   Yet, I am disappointed the crop insurance conference committee members dropped a provision that sought to maintain conservation compliance as a part of crop insurance coverage. 
   As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I helped secure $6 billion last year (over a four year period) in order to improve the overall crop insurance program. This year, funds were added to this level to bring a total of $8.2 billion over five years to crop insurance improvements. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I am pleased the legislation I cosponsored and supported closely mirrors the conference report before us today; therefore, I am pleased to vote for H.R. 2259. 
   Nonetheless, I want to discuss some items in the economic and disaster assistance package included in the conference report. I am concerned that the conference committee ignored the inequity inherent with the current farm bill, and instead, chose to make economic aid payments to farmers based on AMTA payments. 
   Even though South Dakota producers stand to receive--in a timely fashion--about $158 million in additional AMTA payments within the economic aid package, these payments are unfair to many of the family farmers in my state for a number of reasons. 
   First, AMTA payments are made regardless of whether crop prices are high or low. I would prefer an approach (in overall farm policy and in the context of disaster aid) that provides targeted, counter-cyclical benefits to family-sized farmers because it would be more market-oriented and provide a more reliable safety net. 
   Second, since AMTA payments are based on outdated crop yields and base acres from 1985, they are unfair to many South Dakota farmers. In the mid-1980s, farmers in my state planted more grain sorghum and oats in combination with the staple crops like wheat, corn, and soybeans. But, all of these crops make up their ``base acres'' upon which an AMTA payment is made. As such, farmers in South Dakota may receive AMTA payments on low-value crops like oats and grain sorghum that they don't even plant today. 
   Moreover, crop yields in the mid-1980s were much lower than crop yields today, yet, AMTA payments are based on these outdated crop yields. For example, the 1985 corn yield assigned to AMTA payments is set at 64 bushels per acre. Yet today, most farmers raise around 100 bushels of corn or better. Once again, the AMTA payments fail to recognize modern day farming conditions. 
   Finally, there still exist situations where landlords and not farm operators receive the AMTA payments. 
   Last week I sent a letter to Conference Committee Chairmen LUGAR and COMBEST insisting that Congress must not alter statutory payment limitations so large farming entities can't swallow up the majority of government assistance. Last year, an amendment to the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill increased payment limits on loan deficiency payments and marketing loans from $75,000 to $150,000 for 1999. As a result of this specific change last year, only the largest of the large farms stood to benefit. My letter urged the conference committee members to not extend this special treatment of the payment limits beyond 1999. I am very pleased the conference committee agreed to reinstate the more responsible, lower, payment limits for this year. Family farmers are the backbone of rural America. If we have a limited amount of taxpayer funds in which to provide a safety net for farmers, it is simply common sense that we target the benefits to those who need the assistance.  
   I also want to mention that there are several items within the economic and disaster aid package that I support, and as such, I will vote in favor of this legislation. 
   First, sheep producers in South Dakota have suffered under near all-time low wool prices. To add insult to injury, many of these same producers must try to compete in lamb meat production with unfair and surging imports from other countries. I am especially pleased the conference committee agreed to provide $11 million in fiscal year 2001 to provide direct payments to sheep producers based on poor wool prices. 
   Second, as a strong advocate of farmer-owned value-added cooperatives, I am extremely satisfied to support the inclusion of $15 million worth of competitive grants in fiscal year 2001 to assist producers in establishing these types of business ventures. 
   Because flooding remains an obstacle to crop production in many parts of South Dakota, I am pleased to support the $24 million in the conference report for the Flooded Lands Compensation Program. 
   I am also pleased this legislation offers honey producers in South Dakota and across the nation a recourse loan program to help provide a safety net and price support in order to market their product. 
   Finally, I am pleased the conference committee included provisions from my legislation--S. 2056, The Emergency Commodity Distribution Act of 2000--which restores funding to USDA in order to procure commodities for the School Lunch Program over a nine year period. 
   Last year, Congress enacted the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act. A provision of this legislation amended the School Lunch Act to require USDA to count the value of ``bonus'' commodities when it determines the total amount of commodity assistance provided to schools. This change will result in a $500 million budget cut for the School Lunch Program over a nine-year period without congressional action this year. While not large in overall budget terms, this cut will have an immediate impact that is especially severe in school districts more dependent on the program. 
   My legislation would ensure that schools receive the full value of entitlement commodity assistance, and allow the School Lunch Program to continue to meet its dual purpose of supporting American agriculture while providing nutritious food to children across the country. While the provision included in today's legislation provides $34 million in fiscal year 2000 and $76 million in fiscal year 2001, it does not restore the entire $500 million over the nine-year period. However, I am greatly pleased the conferees agreed to include part of my legislation in the conference report as this represents a step in the right direction. 
   I also encouraged the conference committee to consider inclusion of my bills to forbid packer ownership of livestock and to label meat for its country-of-origin. 
   My legislation enjoys broad support all across the nation because it will restore confidence and freedom in livestock markets. I am disappointed the committee failed to include either of these items as it will once again become clear that Congress largely ignored the independent livestock producer trying to compete in an unfair marketplace.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I, along with Senators BINGAMAN, DASCHLE, and INOUYE, am introducing legislation to establish an innovative funding mechanism to enhance the ability of Indian tribes to construct, repair, and maintain quality educational facilities. Representatives  from tribal schools in my State of South Dakota have been working with tribes nationwide to develop an initiative which I believe will be a positive first step toward addressing the serious crisis we are facing in Indian education. 
   Mr. President, over 50 percent of the American Indian population in this country is age 24 or younger. Consequently, the need for improved educational programs and facilities, and for training the American Indian workforce is pressing. American Indians have been, and continue to be, disproportionately affected by both poverty and low educational achievement. The high school completion rate for Indian people aged 20 to 24 was 12.5 percent below the national average. American Indian students, on average, have scored far lower on the National Assessment for Education Progress indicators than all other students. 
   By ignoring the most fundamental aspect of education; that is, safe, quality educational facilities, there is little hope of breaking the cycle of low educational achievement, and the unemployment and poverty that result from neglected academic potential. 
   The Indian School Construction Act establishes a bonding authority to use existing tribal education funds for bonds in the municipal finance market which currently serves local governments across the Nation. Instead of funding construction projects directly, these existing funds will be leveraged through bonds to fund substantially more tribal school, construction, maintenance and repair projects. 
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates the tribal school construction and repair backlog at over $1 billion. Confounding this backlog, inflation and facility deterioration severely increases this amount. The administration's school construction request for fiscal year 2001 was over $62 million. In this budgetary climate, I believe every avenue for efficiently stretching the Federal dollar should be explored. 
   Tribal schools in my State and around the country address the unique learning needs and styles of Indian students, with sensitivity to Native cultures, ultimately promoting higher academic achievement. There are strong historical and moral reasons for continued support of tribal schools. In keeping with our special trust responsibility to sovereign Indian nations, we need to promote the self-determination and self-sufficiency of Indian communities. Education is absolutely vital to this effort. Allowing the continued deterioration and decay of tribal schools through lack of funding would violate the Government's commitment and responsibility to Indian nations and only slow the progress of self-sufficiency. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to closely examine the Indian School Construction Act and join me in working to make this innovative funding mechanism a reality. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be added at the end of my remarks.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, for the eighth year in a row, the Uniform Crime Report indicates that violent crime has decreased across our country. In 1999, the number of murders, rapes, aggravated assaults, robberies, and property crimes decreased eight percent in the Midwest and seven percent overall. While crime experts will argue endlessly on the reasons behind this remarkable trend, I believe that local, state, and federal law enforcement are primarily responsible for making our streets safer than a decade before. 
   While I am pleased with the results of this new report, it is important to remember that behind every crime statistic, there is a child, a spouse, a relative, or a friend that has been victimized. Even one crime is too many because that crime victim has been violated in a way that forever changes their life. In our country's haste to focus on what should happen to the criminal, the victim is too often overlooked. That doesn't have to be the case, and I believe that more should be done to assist crime victims in South Dakota and around the country. 
   As a former prosecutor, I am well aware that victimization in and of itself is terrible to cope with, let alone the anguish of a legal proceeding and restitution recovery. The voice of the victim should be heard at every step of the criminal process, and local and state programs should have adequate resources to effectively deal with crime victims. 
   States have taken the lead in protecting the rights of crime victims, and it is time for the federal government to follow suit. South Dakota provides a number of specific ``victims rights'' including the right to restitution, notices of scheduled hearings and releases, an explanation of the criminal charges and process, and the opportunity to present a written or oral victim impact statement at trial. South Dakota also has victim/witness assistants in many of the prosecutor's offices across the state who work with crime victims on a daily basis. 
   I am a cosponsor of the Crime Victims Assistance Act which enhances victims' rights for federal crimes and provides several grants for state and local prosecutors, judges, prison employees, and law enforcement officials  to improve their handling of crime victims as well. However, instead of passing this important piece of legislation that would have an immediate impact on state and local efforts to improve crime victims services, some in Congress prefer to focus their attention on proposals to amend the United States Constitution. I have reservations about amending the constitution while Congress has the ability to enact legislation instead to accomplish the same goal. I am more concerned that this focus on a constitutional amendment has slowed the pace of crime victim legislation over the past several years. It is critical that Congress pass and the President sign into law the Crime Victims Assistance Act this year. 
   In addition to the Crime Victims Assistance Act, Congress must pass this year the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA II). Since enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, the number of forcible rapes of women have declined, and the number of sexual assaults nationwide have gone down as well. South Dakota organizations have received $6.7 million in federal funding for domestic abuse programs and $1.6 million in federal funding for battered women's shelters. 
   Despite the success of the Violence Against Women Act, domestic abuse and violence against women continue to plague our communities. Consider the fact that a woman is raped every five minutes in this country and more women are injured by domestic violence each year than by automobile accidents and cancer deaths combined. Local and state officials should have access to more--not fewer--resources to address domestic violence, and it is critical that programs authorized through VAWA II receive stable levels of funding for the next five years. 
   Supporters of a constitutional amendment for crime victims have withdrawn their proposal from consideration on the Senate floor this year. I am hopeful that my colleagues will seize this opportunity to continue the very valuable discussion on crime victims' rights and work to pass the Crime Victims Assistance Act and VAWA II as soon as possible.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the South Dakota State Medical Association (SDSMA) Alliance. This year the SDSMA Alliance will celebrate its 90th anniversary, making it the oldest continuous medical Alliance in the United States. For ninety years, this physicians' spouses organization has proudly been the volunteer hands and voices of the South Dakota State Medical Association. 
   Though their accomplishments may not be always easily enumerated or quantified, their impact has been felt across every mile of the state of South Dakota. The SDSMA Alliance has led or united with other organizations in an effort to insure that our communities are healthier and safer. Members of the SDSMA Alliance have always reached out to feed the hungry, give warmth to those who were cold, provide shelter and safety to the abused, and bring smiles and joy to children in need of books or toys. Health promotion and community projects are, indeed, the cornerstone of the Alliance. 
   Oftentimes, the mission statement of an organization tells us all we need to know about the character of the individuals who have joined together. In the case of the SDSMA Alliance, this statement holds true once again. Their mission to promote public health, create safer communities, protect the patient-physician relationship, and generate funds to help educate future physicians is a testament to their desire to positively impact every South Dakota community in which their work is done. 
   As just one example of the Alliance's hard work and dedication, last June they declared-not war-but peace on all school campuses throughout out state. Their focus was not just on guns and grenades, but bullying and fist fights, taunting and threats, intolerance and isolation, because that, as we all know, is where the problems usually begin. 
   To emphasize the need to provide our children and educators with a safe school environment, the SDSMA Alliance launched a campaign to provide K-3rd grade students with conflict resolution and self-esteem building activities. Thousands of ``I Can Choose,'' ``I Can Be Safe,'' ``Hands Are Not For Hitting,'' and ``Be A Winner'' workbooks were distributed to schools and shelters throughout our state. Their goal was to arm children with self-esteem and to teach them how to make healthier and safer choices. It is efforts such as these that weave the fabric of our communities closer together and promote safe, learning environments for South Dakota's children. 
   Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise today to recognize the South Dakota State Medical Association Alliance for ninety years of hard work and dedication to the health and safety of the people of South Dakota. I applaud the SDSMA Alliance's efforts to combat those forces in our society which would jeopardize the mental and physical wellness of any citizen. I sincerely thank the Alliance for their positive contributions to South Dakota's communities, and I hope that one day we can stand together and say, ``Mission accomplished.''

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation as one more step in my fight to combat rising prescription drug prices and reduce the cost of medication for consumers in this country. My legislation, called the Generic Pharmaceutical Access and Choice For Consumers Act of 2000, aims to reduce the cost of prescription medication to American taxpayers and the U.S. government by encouraging the use of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, therapeutically equivalent generic prescription drugs within the federal health care programs, except if the non-generic form is either ordered by the prescribing physician or requested by the patient. 
   The Generic Pharmaceutical Access and Choice For Consumers Act of 2000 establishes a straightforward and cost-effective means of increasing consumers' access and choice to safe, affordable generic prescription drugs  under federal health care programs which could result in savings of millions of dollars. 
   The Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which last year spent $18.2 billion providing health insurance coverage to its estimated 4.12 million enrollees, spent nearly twenty percent, $3.6 billion, of their insurance program costs on pharmaceutical benefits alone. This year brought little relief when the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced that FEHBP premium increases for the year 2000 were about 9.3 percent, mostly attributable to the cost increase in prescription drug claims. 
   In 1997, about one-third of all prescriptions under the FEHBP were for generic drugs. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which administers the FEHBP, estimated that total costs for prescription drugs would drop by about fifteen percent if half of all prescriptions were for generic drugs. 
   A 1998 study conducted by the Congressional Budget Office estimates that generic pharmaceutical substitution saves consumers nationwide approximately eight to ten billion dollars a year. 
   Some FEHBP plans and other federal health care programs do to some extent encourage the use of generic prescription drugs but the practice is not mandatory or universally incorporated into all programs. The Generic Pharmaceutical Access and Choice For Consumers Act simply directs all federal health care programs that provide prescription drug plans to fill prescriptions with FDA approved, therapeutically equivalent generic prescription drugs, except if the non-generic form is either ordered by the prescribing physician or requested by the patient. 
   I believe we can take greater steps to increase the utilization of high-quality, FDA approved generic pharmaceutical which cost between twenty-five and sixty percent less than brand-name pharmaceutical, resulting in an estimated average savings of fifteen to thirty dollars on each prescription filled. 
   Generic pharmaceutical are widely accepted by both consumers and the medical profession, as the market share held by generic pharmaceutical compared to brand-name prescription drugs has more than doubled during the last decade, from approximately nineteen to forty-three percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Yet, despite accounting for just over forty percent of the prescriptions drugs dispensed, generic pharmaceutical represent only 8 percent of the total dollar volume spent on drugs. 
   Since there exists no current coverage for outpatient prescription drugs under the Medicare program, a second component of my bill includes a Sense of the Senate that legislative language requiring, to the extent feasible, a preference for the safe and cost-effective use of generic pharmaceutical be considered in conjunction with any legislation that adds a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. I strongly believe that the utilization of high-quality generic pharmaceutical in a Medicare prescription drug benefit would provide a built in cost control mechanism that would help ensure the economic feasibility and sustainability of any new benefit. 
   And third, the bill I am introducing today works to prevent a tactic used by the brand drug industry to prevent generics from reaching the consumers by convincing state legislatures to pass unwarranted restrictions to the substitution of generic versions of brand name drugs. The campaign that some brand name drug companies lobby in some states is nothing more than an attempt by the brand name companies to protect their market share. The Generic Pharmaceutical Access and Choice For Consumers Act increases the level playing field for generic pharmaceutical by requiring the Food and Drug Administration, where appropriate, to determine that a generic pharmaceutical is the therapeutic equivalent of its brand-name counterpart, and affording national uniformity to that determination. 
   The legislation would also prevent a State from establishing or continuing any requirement that keeps generic pharmaceutical off the market once FDA has determined that a generic drug is ``therapeutically equivalent'' to a brand name drug. This provision will ensure that generic prescription drugs get to the market in a timely fashion and provide consumers with access and choice to low cost, high-quality alternatives. 
   As the year continues, we will see more discussion about how we provide Medicare coverage of prescription drugs and I hope that ultimately that's where we'll wind up some day. However, I believe that minimizing cost through full access to generic drugs must be part of any effort to address the prescription drug pricing issue. I introduced the Generic Pharmaceutical Access and Choice For Consumers Act of 2000 to lay the ground work early in these discussions and take some constructive steps in the right direction so that the American public can get the full benefit of safe, affordable generic prescription drugs and taxpayers are treated right at the same time.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans Higher Education Opportunities Act. I am pleased to be joined by the distinguished Senator COLLINS of Maine in bringing this important issue to the Senate floor today. 
   The 1944 GI Bill of Rights is one of the most important pieces of legislation ever passed by Congress. No program has been more successful in increasing educational opportunities for our country's veterans while also providing a valuable incentive for the best and brightest to make a career out of military service. This bill has allowed eight million veterans to finish high school and 2.3 million service members to attend college.  
   Unfortunately, without this update the current GI Bill can no longer deliver these results and fails in its promise to recruits and service members. The legislation that Senator COLLINS and I are introducing today will take an important first step in modernizing the GI Bill. 
   Over 96% of recruits currently sign up for the Montgomery GI Bill and pay $1,200 out of their first year's pay to guarantee eligibility. But only one-half of these military personnel use any of the current Montgomery GI Bill benefits. This is evidence that the current GI Bill simply does not meet their needs.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I applaud anybody who attempts to address issues of veterans' health care. However, I think it is regrettable that the Senator from Pennsylvania chose not to work in a bipartisan fashion with Senators CRAIG, WELLSTONE, myself, and other veterans organizations across the country with our amendment that we will be offering very shortly, which has a longer-term, 5-year fix for the veterans' health care funding shortfall. 
   Our amendment will far more significantly address the problems with veterans' health care in this Nation. The one offered by Senator SANTORUM is a fine step, in a small sense. I have no problems supporting it. I think the body needs to understand that we will come to a far more significant amendment shortly. The amendment this morning will deal with a 5-year approach to veterans' health care.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator WELLSTONE of Minnesota, for his extraordinary work on this issue. He has long been a champion of veterans in our Nation. I have enjoyed the opportunity to work with him on this and many other issues. 
   I am appreciative of Chairman DOMENICI's effort to secure a $1.4 billion increase in outlays in the budget. We have come a considerable distance from a year ago, when I was offering on this floor a $3 billion increase in veterans' health care appropriations which was necessary at that time to catch up after 3 years of frozen VA budgets. Of the $3 billion that was passed, ultimately, by the time the Appropriations Committee was done, we had about $1.7 billion. Even so, it was a significant increase. It has done a lot to breathe additional viability into our VA health care system. 
   This year, Senator DOMENICI has proposed a $1.4 billion increase. That is encouraging. However, the Authoritative Independent Budget produced by 40 different veterans groups and medical societies--including Amvets and Disabled American Vets, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the VFW--reminds us that even then we still need an additional $500 million in outlays over the Budget Committee's level to raise the funding level to the point where it is requested in the independent budget of a $1.9 billion increase for fiscal 2000. This amendment pays for this. This amendment would get us to that needed level. 
   We need to make a fundamental decision in this body about where our priorities lie. We are talking now about multibillion-dollar surpluses in the Federal budget over the coming years. We ought to be cautious about whether they materialize or not, but certainly we can be optimistic that we will be in black ink in the coming years. 
   The question then is, Are we going to fully fund the veterans' health care programs at the level the veterans organizations themselves contend--I think rightfully so--is necessary? Are we going to put them as a first priority honoring those people who put their lives on the line and made our liberties possible or are we going to fall back to the point where, again, we only use the dollars that are left over after other things have been done? 
   To me, this ought to be a first-priority item. We have an opportunity on the floor this evening to make it very clear to our colleagues in the other body that, in fact, veterans' health care is a first priority item and that we will take care of that. When we are done with dealing with veterans' health care issues, we will then move on to whatever our other priorities might be, whether they be tax cuts, education, health care, or other matters facing the country. This ought to be at the top or near the top of our agenda as we debate the look of the Federal budget in this coming year. 
   I applaud the constructive steps that have been taken on veterans' health care. I certainly am appreciative of the work of Senator WELLSTONE in helping to raise the visibility of this issue. At this juncture, as we shape this budget resolution which creates a roadmap, which creates the parameters for where the appropriations committees will go next, we need to send them this kind of message that, in fact, we want full funding for veterans' health care. 
   This is our opportunity to make that statement. We should not let this opportunity go by without making it clear that we 
   are committed to this reasonable level of funding, after those many years of frozen VA budgets, that the VA requires. 
   Mr. President, I yield back my time.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the Senate yesterday approved my amendment to the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution that establishes a reserve fund which creates room in the Senate budget resolution for military retiree health care improvements. I thank Budget Committee Chairman DOMENICI for working with me and supporters of my amendment. I also want to recognize the driving force behind this issue: the thousands of military retirees and  their dependents across this country who have established an impressive grassroots effort. Their work, in conjunction with the efforts of the Retired Enlisted Association, the National Association of Uniformed Services, the National Military and Veterans Association, and the Retired Officers Association, have brought military health care to the forefront. 
   My amendment would allow the Senate Armed Services Committee to increase spending on military retiree health care while considering the fiscal year 2001 Department of Defense Authorization bill. It is important to note that my amendment must also be approved by the House and Senate conference committee on the budget resolution in order for the Senate Armed Services Committee to use the reserve fund. 
   A promise of lifetime health care has been broken. Testimony from military recruiters themselves, along with copies of recruitment literature dating back to World War II, show that health care was promised to active duty personnel and their families upon the personnel's retirement. 
   However, the creation on June 7, 1956, of space-available care for military retirees at military hospitals has led to a broken promise of health care coverage for these men and women and their families. Post-cold-war downsizing of military bases and their medical services have left many retirees out in the cold. A final insult is the fact that military retirees and their dependents are kicked off of the military's health care system, Tricare, upon turning age 65. 
   Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee and said: ``Sir, I think the first thing we need to do is make sure that we acknowledge our commitment to the retirees for their years of service and for what we basically committed to at the time that they were recruited into the armed forces.'' 
   Defense Secretary William Cohen testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee and said: ``We have made a pledge, whether it's legal or not, it's a moral obligation that we will take care of all those who served, retired veterans and their families, and we have not done so.'' 
   My oldest son, Brooks, served as a peacekeeper with the United States Army in Bosnia, and he was recently deployed to Kosovo. I know how important ``quality of life'' issues are to military personnel and their families. Our country asks young men and women to willingly work in combat zones and receive minimal pay compared to the private sector. As compensation, military personnel have been promised that their health care needs and those of their families will be taken care of now and upon retirement. Despite the best efforts of many talented health care providers in the military, this promise has been broken, and it is impacting a young man or woman's decision to make a career of the military. 
   The question is whether Members of Congress want to make military retiree health care a priority instead of an afterthought. I am hopeful that, working on a bipartisan approach similar to that seen with my reserve fund amendment, we in Congress can choose military retiree health care as a priority this session.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2097, which will help provide local broadcast coverage for all Americans. Under legislation we passed last year, satellite companies are for the first time free to broadcast local network broadcasting into local markets. What we are doing today will make that benefit a reality for Americans who live outside the largest 40 television markets across America. 
   As do many colleagues, I represent a State with rural viewers who should not be left out of the information age. South Dakota is one of the 16 States that do not have a single city among the top 70 markets. Without this loan guarantee, markets such as Sioux Falls and Rapid City simply will not get local service, despite the fact there is a great need for the reception of that local broadcasting. 
   This proposal is about more than just providing sports or entertainment programming over local channels. It is a critical way to receive important local news, public affairs, storm information, road reports, public safety, school closings, and so on. Rural Americans need the same opportunity to access their local networks as do our urban friends, and this legislation would go a long way toward making that a reality. 
   I want to thank the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator GRAMM, for his hard work on this important issue. He correctly raised several issues which have strengthened this bill, adding critical taxpayer protections to the program. I want to thank Senator SARBANES, the ranking member of the Banking Committee for his hard work on this legislation as well. 
   As a sign of the support we have for this package, I have agreed with Senators GRAMM and SARBANES to oppose all amendments to the bill with one exception. I will be offering shortly an amendment to correct a significant flaw in this bill. Other than that one change, I believe we have produced a substantive bill that will produce this service to all Americans without resorting to risks for the American taxpayers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, we have reached concurrence on the core of this legislation, and I commend Senator GRAMM for his work with us on that matter. We have had bipartisan cooperation. 
   We have one remaining issue in particular, however, that remains to be resolved. Senator GRAMM has an amendment which opens up the possibility of CFC financing but under very circumscribed conditions, which I contend are so severe as to make CFC financing very unlikely. The question is: What can we do to lower the cost of financing to make this programming available to rural Americans and yet do so in a responsible, fiscally prudent manner? 
   The amendment offered by Senator GRAMM does essentially three things: 
   First, it requires that any lender that is a nonprofit, such as a CFC, cannot provide financing under this act unless the board determines the credit rating of the lender will not decline upon the approval and funding of the loan. 
   Second, it requires that nonprofit lenders sell any loans guaranteed under this act if their credit rating declines. 
   Third, it excludes GSE lenders, such as CoBank, from participating in this program. 
   It is inappropriate, I believe, to require the board to make a judgment on the impact on the credit rating of a nonprofit lender, such as a CFC, because, one, it places the burden of proof on the lender to show why its rating would not decrease. Under the proposed amendment, the board would need to predict future actions of credit rating agencies, and I do not believe this is a reasonable requirement to impose on a governmental board. 
   In reaching the bipartisan compromise in this legislation, I went along with the creation of a board. This was a good idea on the part of Chairman GRAMM. It involved the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, as well as the Department of Agriculture, to oversee this lending to make sure we have that extra element of prudence. But I believe it is simply not fair to put a burden of proof on the board to certify in advance what, in fact, is going to happen to a rating on the part of a CFC or another nonprofit. 
   Wall Street credit rating agencies make determinations on credit ratings on a continuous basis. This is a real world market discipline that is imposed on lenders by the capital markets. A board of three people, qualified as they may be, is not an appropriate substitute for market discipline. It makes no sense, I believe, to charge this board with the requirement to predict that the credit rating of any lender will not decline. 
   CFC raises funds in the private capital markets through sale of bonds, sale of equity hybrid securities, and by equity investments by CFC owners. All of these entities have expressed their confidence in CFC, and that is a real test of the CFC's strength. 
   The CFC has demonstrated over its 30-year life that it understands rural energy and telecommunications markets. It has done a fine job of evaluating credit risks and has made sound credit decisions. CFC is not a new or untested entity in the marketplace. 
   It may be argued that all CFC loans are to ``utilities with captive customers.'' This is not true. Many rural electric and telephone cooperatives do have a monopoly position in their service areas, just as other utilities do. However, in the electric area, deregulation is being implemented in a number of States, and co-ops and other utilities in those States are, in fact, facing a competitive marketplace. 
   In the telecommunications area, CFC, through its controlled affiliate, the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative, has made loans to a number of projects that include highly competitive services, including wireless telephone services, PCS, and CLEC service in rural areas that were previously poorly served by incumbent providers. 
   The question then is: Why add an additional layer of bureaucratic review to one class of lenders--CFC and other nonprofits--when that level of review is not imposed on other lenders? This delays implementation in this needed program, adds costs, and provides a competitive advantage to for-profit finance companies. 
   The amendment does not require banks to be within the highest three ratings categories, and most are not. 
   Why would this provision be applied to nonprofit lenders and not to for-profit banks? 
   I have a chart here which I think is interesting. The bottom line shows the Cooperative Finance Corporation's AA- rating under S&P and Aa3 rating under Moody, which compares with the largest banks in America. I think it is of interest that even if there were a decline, the CFC would still have a rating higher than most of the largest banks in the United States. 
   A second point has to do with the requirement that a lender sell its loan if its credit rating declines. The requirement that a nonprofit lender sell a loan guaranteed under this act if its credit rating declines is an onerous provision that would cause significant financial stress and costs to the lender. If such a decline in a lender's rating should occur, a forced sale at that time could result in still further financial losses. 
   This is basically, I believe, a poisonous provision designed to exclude nonprofit lenders, such as the CFC. Even if the credit rating of an AA rated company would decline to AA-, it would still have a significantly higher credit rating than the vast majority of banks in America. No similar requirement is being imposed on banks. I believe the idea of requiring a lender to sell loans is not the proper remedy. 
   The last point I would make is, I believe the exclusion of lenders under the program is an unwise public policy. The exclusion of lenders under this program will only increase the cost of funds to borrowers and ultimately to rural and other TV viewers. 
   The bill already establishes a sound process for the evaluation of projects applying for financing. This process includes approval by a board that includes the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Agriculture, advice from NTIA, evaluation, underwriting and analysis by the Rural Utilities Service, and the commitment of private lenders that are on the line to take a very substantial risk in the event of default by a project funded under this program. 
   I believe that much of what we have accomplished in this legislation--the creation of a board and an 80-percent guaranteed loan rather than the 100 percent which, frankly, was the idea being pushed in the House and which I originally thought might be the way to go--we have diminished to an 80-percent guarantee; we have set up a board. I think we have a responsible approach to this guaranteed loan process. 
   But I do believe that Senator GRAMM's amendment would go one step further to the point of, in effect, making it very difficult, if not impossible, for the board and institutions, such as a Cooperative Financing Corporation, to participate in the program. 
   Keep in mind, our amendment does not require that the CFC be involved at all. It simply makes it an alternative financing strategy that would be available for the board, with the Secretaries of Commerce, Treasury, and USDA to evaluate. I have great confidence in their leadership. 
   I think if we were to adopt this second-degree amendment, we would be back to what I believe would be a clean bill. 
   I look forward to additional debate.

I express appreciation particularly to Senators THOMAS of Wyoming and GRAMS of Minnesota for their work and their staffs' work on this legislation.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, if I might take 1 minute--I know there are a number of others who want to address this legislation, and I have to return to the Budget Committee as well for a series of votes--let me observe, having listened carefully to the chairman's remarks, that I think the differences we have are fairly straightforward, in a sense. 
   On the one hand, our amendment says we have already come up with some safety provisions with an 80-percent guarantee rather than 100 percent, and so on. But what we are suggesting is that guidelines be adopted by the board, by Mr. Greenspan, by Treasury, and by USDA. They certainly have it within their prerogative to develop whatever guidelines they feel appropriate to ensure that the lending practices are secure and sound from the perspective of the taxpayers. 
   The Senator from Texas, rather than relying on the Fed, the Treasury and USDA, is suggesting that he will impose guidelines statutorily. We now have, I believe, the consequence of, in effect, shutting out the CFC from participating in the program. 
   I think we have a solid piece of legislation with the Johnson-Thomas-Grams amendment. We would then turn to the board as the chief instrument for any further fine-tuning of what kind of provisions might be helpful to them in seeing to it that these loans are handled in due course and in the proper fashion. 
   I think that is the difference we have between the underlying Gramm amendment and our second-degree amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   I commend Senator GRAMM, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and his staff, Senator THOMAS, Senator GRAMS, Senator BURNS, Senator SARBANES and his staff, and others who have worked diligently on this. We have spent a lot of time on it. 
   I believe we are almost at the moment where we can offer a compromise amendment and resolve this once and for all. We just received a copy of the amendment. There are one or two points that are being checked with counsel. Within literally minutes, we should be able to confirm the language is exactly what we think it is. 
   I am appreciative of the bipartisan effort that went into making this legislation a reality. The legislation last fall was a good bill. It permitted the broadcast of local signals to local areas, but we did need the guarantee loan provisions to get into the smaller television markets. 
   It has just been confirmed to me the language is as we thought. 
   Again, I applaud Senator GRAMM and others for their work in that regard.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, this week the Senate Budget Committee is about to proceed with a markup of the budget resolution, an effort that is overdue. Nonetheless, it will be taken up this week. I think we should examine the context in which the budget resolution will be considered in the Senate. 
   There was some awfully good news for American families this weekend. It was announced this weekend that the Federal income tax burden for American families has shrunk to the lowest level in 40 years. Who says this? Studies by both liberal and conservative tax experts, the administration, and two arms of the Republican-controlled Congress confirmed that the Federal income tax burden for families in America is lower than it has been for 40 years. 
   The middle fifth of American families, with an average income of $39,100, paid 5.4 percent in income tax last year compared to 8.3 percent in 1981. 
   A four-person family, with a median income of $54,900, paid 7.46 percent of their income in income tax--the lowest since 1965. And a median two-earner family, making $68,605, paid 8.8 percent in 1988, which is about the same as in 1955. 
   In fact, one-third of American families no longer pay income tax. 
   That is the context in which we need to take up what we are going to do as a people relative to our newfound economic prosperity that is being projected by so many. 
   We need to remember, too, how we arrived at this point. 
   In 1993, when President Clinton took office, he inherited a budget with a record deficit of $290 billion per year. In 1993, we passed the Budget Act without a single Republican vote--none in the House; none in the Senate. In fact, Vice President AL GORE cast the deciding vote on this floor in the Senate and created a framework for a remarkable turnaround. 
   From almost 30 years of continuing hemorrhaging red ink and growing deficits, we then had 7 years in a row of declining deficits--in fact, the last 3 in surplus, even over and above that required for Social Security. 
   For fiscal year 2000, we are looking at a $26 billion surplus over and above Social Security. In the meantime, that set the framework for 107 consecutive months of economic growth. There have been 20.4 million new jobs since 1993. Home ownership is up a record 67 percent. Real wages have increased since the beginning of the Clinton administration by 6.6 percent, reversing a two-decade-long trend of declining real wages. 
   From 1993 to 1998, the number of poor people in America declined by 4.8 million and the number of poor children went down by 2.1 million. In these past 7 years, 7.2 million have left the welfare rolls--a 51-percent decline in the welfare rolls. Welfare recipients now account for the lowest percentage of the U.S. population since 1967, the height of the Vietnam war. 
   In 1999, Federal spending was the smallest share of our gross domestic product since 1966. Lower- and middle-income Americans had the smallest tax burden in 40 years, as noted by the study that came out this weekend. And we are now paying down debt. 
   By the end of fiscal year 2000, the Treasury expects to have reduced our debt held by the public by about $300 billion--that is ``billion'' with a ``B''--from where it was only 3 years ago. 
   Now we have this great national debate. The experts in both the House and the Senate are projecting about a $3 trillion surplus over the coming 10 years, thanks, in very large part, to the decision made in 1993 to set that framework for prosperity and growth. We are talking about a $3 trillion surplus. And $2 trillion of that is attributable to Social Security. To the good credit of the President of the United States, he said: Save Social Security first. Our Republican friends have concurred. That is off the table. 
   The next question is, then: What do you do about the remaining $1 trillion over the coming 10 years? The first thing is to be very cautious. Indeed, we have a hard time projecting 1 year in advance, much less 10 years in advance, what is going to happen to our economy. 
   We cannot get too giddy about how to spend or give back or do whatever with $1 trillion that may or may not materialize. But that is the debate that is going on today. It is going on between the two Presidential candidates. It has been going on between the parties. The American public themselves are trying to digest what kind of vision we have for America in the first 10 years of this century, the first 10 years of this millennium. 
   George W. Bush has said he knows what to do with the $1 trillion dollars: 
   essentially give it all back in a tax cut, commit to that now. If $1 trillion doesn't actually show up, too bad, because Social Security, Medicare, and virtually everything else we do will be in jeopardy. 
   There are others, including myself, who say, first, be prudent about whether this trillion is going to materialize. To the degree that it does, let us look at making sure that we protect the long-term viability of Medicare, which is in shaky financial condition. Most concur. Secondly, let us put some additional dollars towards paying down the debt. That will keep the interest rates down. It will continue to foster economic growth and prosperity. It will make the ability to buy a car, a house, to create new jobs, to run a farm or ranch all cost less. It will do more than many other things the Federal Government could do. 
   Third, let's make sure we do make key investments in our schools. We have crumbling schools all across the country. We have schools that have a greater need for better technology. We have teacher pay problems. We have problems all the way from Early Head Start through our graduate programs and research programs, including our technical and vocational programs. Let's put some dollars there as well. That will create a foundation for continued economic growth and prosperity, if we continue to invest in the minds of American citizens. 
   We are in a global economy today. The world is full of people who work as hard as any American for a dollar a day. The question is, Do American workers bring to the table more than just a willingness to work hard but also bring with them the technical skills and intellectual abilities to do things other people in the world cannot do? That is where we need this growing, developing, and constructive partnership between the Federal, State, and local government, public and private, whereby we empower more American citizens to take care of their own needs, to grow the economy, and to make sure America remains the foremost economic power in the world bar none. 
   Yes, in the context of how to use this $1 trillion, let's try to find some room for tax relief, too, but let's target it to middle-class and working families, families who have the most difficult time meeting their bills. When you look at George W. Bush's proposal, it is blown on a tax cut, with nothing for the schools, nothing to invest, nothing to reduce the deficit, nothing to protect Medicare, at least not to the degree that it needs to be done. Then look and see who are the winners and losers on this. 
   The typical middle-class family gets about a $500 tax cut; a-million-dollar-a-year income gets about a $50,000 tax cut. That is not fair, not when we are being told we don't have the money to build new schools. We can't pass a bond issue in most of the counties in my State of South Dakota. Real estate taxes are through the roof. Our ag economy is not doing well. We are wondering how to replace all those 1910, 1920 vintage schools across my State. We are looking at still a great many children who would benefit from Early Head Start programs, Head Start programs. We are looking at the need for better law enforcement. We are looking at the need for investing in our infrastructure, including our rural water. We are looking at all the things we need to do to prepare ourselves for the increasingly challenging economy of this coming century, the coming millennium. 
   That is where the American public is in concurrence with 
   those of us who say, first be prudent about that $1 trillion, making sure that we stay in the black, that we don't go back into the bad red-ink days of the Reagan-Bush  years and the years before that which were bipartisan; both parties were in the red prior to 1993, for over 30 years. We don't want to go back to those days. 
   To the degree we have these dollars to utilize, let's make sure we cover an array of needs we have: paying down further debt; protecting Medicare; investing in our schools, education, making us a more competitive society; doing some things for our families; and, yes, some tax relief as well. But let's do it all in that package rather than some sort of radical libertarian vision of America where the role of the Federal Government is to guard the border and deliver the mail. Many of our friends seem to think we shouldn't be delivering the mail anymore either. 
   I think most Americans have a more moderate, mainstream view. The American people are not ideologues. They are not far to the left. They are not far to the right. They don't want the Government to do everything, and they don't want a situation where the Government does nothing. They are commonsense about their vision of where we need to be. I think we should use caution in taking public opinion polls too seriously around this place. 
   Time after time, poll after poll taken reveals the American public is on the side of this more balanced, thoughtful, deliberative approach to how we are going to position ourselves to be in a situation of strength in the years to come. A lot of people's eyes glass over when we talk about budget issues, dollars and cents, talking about trillions of dollars. It is almost unfathomable. Yet at the heart of it all, where our real values and priorities lie is determined by those dollars-and-cents decisions we make in this body and on which we are about to begin this week. 
   The rhetoric is never lacking. The rhetoric is always in favor of almost everything. But when it comes time to see whether we are going to protect the environment, whether we are going to help our kids, whether we are going to rebuild schools, strengthen Medicare, whether we are going to do something about prescription drugs and health care, as Senator DORGAN from North Dakota has noted, whether we are going to do these kinds of things is, in large measure, dictated by the dollar-and-cents decisions we make on this floor. 
   This is going to be a very crucial week. We will be establishing a budget resolution. I am fearful from what I see headed our way that there is a likelihood that it will be another partisan political exercise at a time when the American public is rightfully frustrated by the lack of ability of the two parties to work together as well as they should. If that is the case, we will see, as we go through the 13 separate appropriations bills or omnibus bill in the end, as may wind up being the case, whether we come out in a way that is, in fact, balanced, which does, in fact, use the resources necessary. 
   It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Two generations have gone by waiting for this opportunity to have our Federal Government in the black and to make some policy decisions about how we can partner together to continue opportunity and prosperity for all of our citizens and not just a few. How tragic it would be if we were to lose this opportunity, if we would say, no, there is no role for the Federal Government to improve Medicare, to keep our rural hospitals open with a decent 
   level of reimbursement, to rebuild our schools, to do the things that need to be done while at the same time providing some tax relief and paying down debt. What a loss that would be if we were to miss that opportunity. 
   There is no more fundamental decision to be made in this the 2nd session of the 106th Congress than these budget issues that are before us this week. We can be proud and we can take some satisfaction in the fact that taxes for middle-class families are now the lowest in 40 years, that we have had 3 years in a row of budget surpluses over and above that required for Social Security, and that our economy has had 8 years in a row of continuous GDP growth. But there is no automatic pilot on which to put our economy. It requires difficult decisions to be made each and every year by the Congress to set the stage for continued prosperity. 
   That is the challenge before us. I am hopeful that before we adjourn at the end of this year, we will be able to look back at this 2nd session of the 106th Congress as truly a watershed time, a fork in the road where we chose the right road to go down in terms of strengthening our society and creating a framework for continued growth and prosperity. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Wayne S. Knutson, of Vermillion, South Dakota, a distinguished member of the arts community. On December 11, 1999, the University of South Dakota renamed Theatre I of the Warren M. Lee Center for the Fine Arts in Dr. Knutson's honor. This is an honor he richly deserves. 
   Dr. Knutson has had a distinguished career as an educator, artist, and administrator at the University of South Dakota and in the state arts community over the past fifty years. His tenure at USD began in 1952 as Professor of Speech and Dramatic Art and Director of University Theatre. Subsequently, he has also held the positions of Professor and Chair of the Department of English (1966-1971), Dean and Professor of Fine Arts (1972-1980), Vice-President for Academic Affairs and Professor of Fine Arts (1980-1982), and Professor of English and Theatre (1982-1986). In 1987, Dr. Knutson was appointed by the South Dakota Board of Regents as the first University Distinguished Professor. 
   As a member of the arts community, he has also served on the Literature Panel of the National Endowment for the Arts (1975-1977) and as chairperson of both the South Dakota Arts Council (1971-1978) and the South Dakota Humanities Council (1989-1991). 
   Dr. Knutson's honors include a Distinguished Service Award from the Speech Communication Association of South Dakota, the Governor's Award for Distinction in the Arts, the Burlington-Northern Faculty Achievement Award, a South Dakota Arts Council Senior Fellowship for Play Direction, and an award for Outstanding Achievement in the Humanities from the South Dakota Humanities Council. 
   In addition to his instrumental work as a professor and an actively involved member of the arts community, Dr. Knutson is also an accomplished author, director, and playwright. He wrote ``The Dakota Descendants of Ola Rue'' and ``Dream Valley'', as well as a number of articles on theatre for Dramatics magazine and a short history of the University of South Dakota. He has directed over sixty-five plays and musicals for USD, the Black Hills Playhouse, Pierre Players, Lewis and Clark Theatre, and the Group Theatre of Rapid City. He has also written ten plays and opera librettos, one of which was aired on Voice of America. 
   Mr. President, Dr. Knutson has a immensely enriched life in South Dakota and the honor of having Theatre I at USD renamed the ``Wayne S. Knutson'' is one he highly deserves. He has been an extraordinary pioneer and supporter of the arts. He is a man of great scholarship and knowledge, and will continue to shape the arts community for years to come. It is an honor for me to share the accomplishments of Dr. Wayne S. Knutson with my colleagues and to publicly commend him on his talent and commitment to the arts and education.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend Girl Scout Troop 290 of Yankton, South Dakota.  
    The girls of Troop 290 have worked especially hard this last year, donating their time and energy to the community. Their wonderful efforts to enhance the lives of many unfortunate South Dakotans at Christmas and Thanksgiving, to assist the community's elderly, to aid impoverished people in Haiti, and to undertake many other key projects has had a very important positive impact in the world around them. 
   Sadly, on November 24, 1999, Brianne Cox, a member of Troop 290, was killed in a tragic accident. She was active not only in Scouts, but enjoyed soccer, softball, dance, violin, trumpet, cross country, basketball, and many other activities. This young lady had a wonderful spirit that touched everyone who knew her. 
   In her name, the Troop 290 scouts have undertaken a very special project. These wonderful girls want to keep Brianne's memory alive and stay close to her family. To this end, they hold a fundraiser every summer to raise money for the `Brianne Cox Memorial Fund'. This effort, in the name of a special girl, will designate funds to other middle school students who wish to participate in the many activities Brianne enjoyed, and who otherwise could not afford it. 
   Mr. President, these girls are true examples of charity and goodness. Their work to elevate the spirit of their hometown is inspiration in itself, but added to their work to keep Brianne Cox's memory alive, is truly extraordinary. I am pleased to be able to share their story with my colleagues and to be able to publicly commend their work.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today is a particularly important day for American seniors. With a unanimous vote, the Senate passed H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom To Work Act which will abolish a Depression-era Social Security restriction that lowers benefits paid to seniors ages 65 to 69 who earn more than a specified amount each year. Earlier this month the House passed H.R. 5 by a vote of 422 to 0. As a proud cosponsor of the Senate version of this bill, I am elated that Congress moved swiftly to pass this long overdue legislation. 
   Presently, the Social Security earnings test reduces benefits $1 for every $3 over earnings of $17,000 for retirees age 65 to 69. Due to the cap on earnings, older Americans, many of whom live on fixed, modest-incomes, are burdened with a 33.3 percent tax on their earned income. When this is combined with Federal, State, local and other Social Security taxes, it amounts to an atrocious 55-65 percent tax or even higher. Such a policy defies the principals of self-reliance and personal responsibility on which America was founded. Seniors who have substantial outside income from investments have never had a similar tax penalty to pay. 
   By eliminating the retirement earnings test, older Americans can now decide whether and how much they want to work without a reduction in their current Social Security benefits. 
   An estimated 800,000 Americans lost all or part of their Social Security benefits in 1999 because they were employed and earned more than the limit. Even a part-time job can put someone over the earnings limit. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the elimination of the earnings test will affect approximately 1,153,000 retirees and auxiliary retirees nationwide, including 3,462 seniors throughout South Dakota. 
   I believe older Americans ages 65 through 69 should be able to work and supplement their Social Security without a benefit reduction, just as other beneficiaries can supplement, without restriction, their Social Security with pensions and unearned income. 
   At a time when labor shortages loom on the horizon and people are living longer, we should encourage, not penalize, older workers. 
   Faced with serious health care expenses, escalating prescription drug prices, long term care needs, and other expenses in caring for a spouse or other family members, older Americans are choosing to stay in the job market longer. By eliminating the earnings test today we have just improved the personal and financial well-being of thousands of seniors throughout South Dakota and our nation. 
   I am very pleased that President Clinton is supportive of the legislation and has indicated that he will sign the bill into law immediately. 
   Today marks a strong vote for older Americans. Seniors are one of our nation's most valuable resources and we should honor and respect them by providing the means necessary to live long, fulfilling lives without worrying about whether or not they can afford to pay their rent, heating bill, and other necessities. As we move forward with the 106th Congress, I look forward to working with my fellow colleagues to implement further programs and a strong legislative agenda which strengthens crucial programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and establishes prescription drug coverage, nursing home reforms, new efforts on long-term care, tools to fight crimes against seniors, new plans to secure retirements and protect pensions, and other initiatives that meet the needs of our growing population of seniors.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to support legislation on the Senate floor today that improves and expands the crop insurance and risk management tools available to farmers in the United States. After months of uncertainty on this issue it is my hope that farmers desiring enhanced crop insurance and risk management options will be reassured that Congress will take a positive step and enact reform this year. 
   Beyond the day-to-day uncertainties facing family farmers and ranchers, matters are complicated today by current economic conditions in rural America. Collapsed crop and livestock prices, weak export demand, and agribusiness concentration continue to threaten the viability of our independent family farmers and ranchers. Crop insurance provides many agricultural producers with a risk management tool, but Congress needs to reform the current program at this time to avoid allowing both low prices and an inadequate safety net to force farmers out of business. 
   Nonetheless, I must caution that no matter how well crop insurance is improved, it is not a substitute for a sound farm policy or safety net. Instead, crop insurance is an important part of that farm safety net. It is my desire to also participate in a farm bill debate this year so Congress can reform the underlying farm bill. But, we must take advantage of this day to act on crop insurance. 
   In 1994, I chaired the House of Representatives subcommittee charged with reforming crop insurance. At the time one of our goals was to improve insurance to a point where the government would not need to develop ad hoc disaster programs. Ad hoc disaster programs are difficult to create, difficult to administer, and are politically unpopular. While I am pleased with many of the reforms we made in 1994, action in Congress to pass crop loss disaster programs in the last two years reminds us that crop insurance has not fully replaced the need for ad hoc disasters. 
   Crop insurance is critical to the farmers of South Dakota. Nearly twenty South Dakota grown crops are currently eligible for crop insurance, and among our major commodities, participation in the crop insurance program is high. Ninety-five percent of our corn acreage is enrolled in crop insurance while 92 percent of our soybean acres are in this program. Wheat producers in South Dakota place 76 percent of their acreage in crop insurance. After the reforms made to the program in 1994, over 10 million acres of farmland in my state have been enrolled in crop insurance. 
   I am pleased to co-sponsor a bipartisan reform bill that is a modification of S. 1580, the Kerrey-Roberts Crop Insurance for the 21st Century Act. Our bill clearly recognizes improved crop insurance is absolutely necessary for farmers in the future. Our underlying bill closely mirrors the crop insurance reform bill enacted in the House of Representatives last year. Finally, our bill addresses some of the most serious concerns of the current crop insurance program; affordability, dependability, and flexibility. 
   The major reform proposed in our bill ensures greater affordability for farmers, especially for higher levels of protection. Nearly every farmer I talk to wants the opportunity to purchase higher levels of coverage, but most have found that a threshold exists were buy-up coverage becomes cost prohibitive. The Kerrey/Roberts bill makes coverage more affordable by providing higher subsidies for higher levels of coverage. South Dakota farmers support this provision of our bill because affordability seems to be the most pressing issue facing crop insurance today. 
   In recent years, the issue of coverage dependability has come into serious question. Farmers in South Dakota and elsewhere have suffered under multiple years of weather related disasters. 
   The bill I support ensures greater coverage dependability by providing relief for producers suffering from insurance coverage decreases and premium increases due to multi-year crop losses resulting from natural disasters. The bill adjusts actual production yield history--APH--for farmers by allowing producers who have suffered under three natural disasters in five years to drop their lowest APH. It also provides APH credit to assist beginning farmers and those who are diversifying with new crop rotations. 
   Finally, the proposal I support authorizes the development of cost of production crop insurance policies. This should eventually be a new, useful tool for producers. It also provides livestock producers hope that the development of some type of livestock coverage is a priority. Livestock producers are the major contributor to South Dakota's agricultural economy, and risk management options are essential for these producers. 
   However, our proposal, S. 2251, differs somewhat from our underlying bill, S. 1580, as well. Months of debate between members of the Senate Agriculture Committee has resulted in a certain degree of compromise on the overall issue of crop insurance and risk management. Some in our Committee believe a lump sum risk management payment  is preferred by farmers in parts of the United Sates. While I am very concerned that a de-coupled, lump sum payment is the wrong approach to take for several reasons, I understand the need to have comity and reasonable compromise in the Senate. Therefore, our proposal includes a pilot project to give farmers a choice between either crop insurance coverage or a risk management payment on a commodity by commodity basis. Yet, there are differences between the two risk management pilot programs offered by our coalition and those supporting large direct lump sum payments. 
   I am concerned the de-coupled payment alternative offered by others of the Committee is flawed. First, dividing a limited amount of money among many producers with a risk management payment fails to ensure the need for ad hoc disaster programs is eliminated. These direct lump sum payments will also be capitalized in land values and make it difficult for small and beginning farmers to compete for land. 
   Moreover, the alternative bill pushed by others in the Committee allows ``double dipping'' of benefits which I oppose. Those who choose a risk management payment are then also eligible for crop insurance under the current premium subsidy structure in the alternative supported by others today. This leads to a problem of complexity in terms of administration because crop insurance agents would be required to be able to quote two sets of premium rates available for farmers. 
   Nonetheless, members of the Senate have every right to propose risk management alternatives that they believe suit the interests of the farmers they represent. So with caution, I understand the need to offer a compromise bill with my colleagues on the floor today that offers some degree of ``choice'' and compromise. So, while the bill I support today also includes a risk management payment choice, it requires a more rigorous set of conditions through certification and random auditing to ensure program compliance. Therefore I believe the risk management payment in our approach is more responsible. That said, I would be remiss if I did not state, unequivocally, that I deeply appreciate the chairman's leadership in the Senate Agriculture Committee, and I respect the fashion in which he allowed the mark-up hearing to take place on March 2. 
   I want to mention one final issue very critical to the overall acceptance and viability of a taxpayer funded program like crop insurance. The issue of potential abuse in the insurance program was discussed in Congressional hearings on crop insurance reform last year. I do not believe fraud or abuse is of epidemic proportion in the crop insurance program. In fact, I believe the lion's share of interests (farmers, agents, loss adjusters, industry, and government) working in and around federal crop insurance are doing so with the highest degree of integrity. However, I am cognizant that questionable claims and potential abuse were of great concern last year. That said, unless steps are taken to bolster compliance and oversight the public support for this vital program may diminish. 
   I am pleased to learn that earlier this month the risk Management Agency announced a major commitment to work with the private insurance industry to strengthen the integrity of crop insurance. I am hopeful this joint effort begins to end the concerns of this important program. I commend those involved in taking this positive step.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, in the absence of Chairman GRAMM and Chairman ENZI, in order to expedite consideration of this very important legislation, I will go forward with a brief discussion and my view of the Export Administration legislation. 
   I rise today in support of the Export Administration Act. I have worked closely on export control issues with Senators ENZI, GRAMM, and SARBANES, and I am pleased that we have reached consideration of this important issue by the full Senate. There are several different classifications of exports. Items which can have both civilian and military applications are considered to be dual-use technology, and those goods are governed by the EAA. 
   There have been numerous attempts to reauthorize the EAA in the years since it expired in 1990. It is unfortunate that this legislation has gone unauthorized for most of this decade, and I strongly urge the Congress to not forgo this opportunity. Reauthorization becomes even more critical as legal challenges to the continued reliance on the expired EAA through emergency powers winds its way through the courts. After ten years of congressional silence, I am fearful that one of these challenges will ultimately succeed, leaving us without any control over sensitive dual use technologies. At that point, even technology which is universally agreed to be dangerous could be freely exported to countries considered to be direct threats to the United States. Reauthorization of the EAA in of itself adds a tremendous component to our national security. 
   I want to especially thank Chairman ENZI for his work on this issue. Without his hands-on leadership, we frankly would not be at this point today. S. 1712 is a testament to MIKE's hard work and the widespread support this bill enjoys derives from Chairman ENZI's commonsense approach to issues. 
   I want to note the important roles played by Banking Committee Chairman GRAMM and Ranking Member SARBANES of Maryland. We have had constructive participation across the board, and that bipartisan cooperation has brought us to this point. That spirit contributed to the unanimous 20-0 vote in support of S. 1712 in the Banking Committee. 
   We had a simple goal when we embarked on this effort: reduce or eliminate controls on items that do not have security implications and tighten controls on items that raise security concerns. While most everyone can agree on these principles, it is much more difficult to draft the language to accomplish that end. 
   We worked very closely with concerned Senators, the national security establishment, the administration, and the impacted industries. I believe we addressed the major concerns of each entity. We increased the penalties, making violators of export control laws pay a real price. We made the foreign availability and mass market standards a true measure of what items could be accessed regardless of U.S. sanctions, and provided for those items to be decontrolled.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that President Clinton announced yesterday his decision to visit Pakistan during his upcoming trip to South Asia. During my recent visit to Pakistan, I met at length with General Musharraf and discussed a number of critically important issues including the prompt restoration of democracy in Pakistan, nuclear arms restraint by both India and Pakistan, and the need to fight global terrorism. The President's upcoming trip will provide an opportunity to continue this dialogue with both Pakistan and India in a manner that can, hopefully, bring lasting peace and economic stability to the region. The fact that both Pakistan and India have nuclear weapons makes it imperative for the United States to facilitate a resolution of a major problem in South Asia--the Kashmir dispute.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my colleagues who have been talking over this past week or so about one of the most critical issues facing America today relative to health care, and that is the lack of affordability and lack of access to prescription drugs for all of our citizens, but particularly for seniors in America. 
   As I go home across my State of South Dakota, one of the issues I hear the most about in every community I go to--large and small--is the cost of prescription drugs. 
   Medicare was created by President Lyndon Johnson as one of the Great Society programs back in the 1960s. At that time, the great unmet health care need for American seniors was the cost of hospitalization. Medicare is not a perfect program, but it has gone a long way toward solving the enormous problem seniors faced at that time--the cost of hospitalization. 
   But no prescription drug benefit was added back then, and medicine has changed radically over the course of the last 35 years. There is a greater reliance on prescription drugs now. Drugs have become increasingly sophisticated. People are living longer. The quality of their lives have been enhanced by the availability--where they can afford it--of prescription drugs. But now the cost of prescription drugs is the highest expenditure and highest financial burden of all on seniors' health care needs next only to the cost of health insurance premiums themselves. Yet while there is a great deal of rhetoric around Washington, there has been too little action up until now on this profound issue. 
   I wind up talking to a great many seniors in particular on this issue. In my home State of South Dakota where we have a lot of people who are former farmers, ranchers, small business people, and employees of small business who had no deluxe pension plan or health plan to fall back on, for a great many of them Social Security is their lion's share if not their total retirement benefit. Medicare is their key health care benefit. 
   Thirty-five percent of seniors in America today have no Medigap coverage whatsoever. In South Dakota that rate would be even higher, and people wind up caught in a terrible predicament. It has put a tremendous financial burden on a great many people who very frequently have hundreds of dollars a month in prescription drug costs. But the problem is all the more challenging for the great many South Dakotans I talk to who have no Medigap policy, who cannot afford that, and then who wind up literally choosing between groceries and staying on their prescriptions. What happens then is all too often they either don't fill the prescription or they take half of the pills or they don't take the pill until they become ill again at which time again they show up at the emergency room with an acute illness. Then Medicare picks up the tab. Then the taxpayers pick up that cost at a much higher cost than would have been the instance if they had been able to stay on prescription drugs in the first place. 
   We wind up with a growing problem, which is the inflationary rate for the cost of prescription drugs. They are going up far higher than the rate of inflation for the rest of the economy. People are on relatively fixed incomes. They are on Social Security and do not have the means oftentimes to pay for any of these bills at all, or pay for enough of them. All too often what little COLA--cost-of-living adjustment--comes along with Social Security is either consumed entirely by the Medicare premium increase or other cost-of-  living increases before they even get to deal with the cost of prescription drugs. 
   I was in a community in South Dakota not too long ago talking to some seniors at a senior center. This is a phenomenon I had never heard ever before, frankly, where they were telling me--these are some seniors who are a little better off than many of the people I talked to; they have a little more financial means--they were going to Texas and to Arizona to snowbird during the winter, but they are paying for the entire cost of their snowbird expense by going across the line to Mexico and buying their prescription drugs for less than half of what they were paying in the United States. The prescription drugs they are buying in foreign countries for half the price are the same branded FDA-approved drugs that people buy in the U.S. 
   It is an outrage when you think about American citizens having to go to Canada, having to go to Mexico, and going other places to get their medication cheaper. It seems sometimes that nobody in the industrialized democratic world pays bills anything like our seniors pay or our citizens in general pay for prescription drugs because it isn't only seniors, although clearly seniors who comprise about 12 percent of the United States population consume well over a third of the prescription drugs. That isn't surprising given the fact that as people grow older they run into health care 
   problems that are more intense and that will require the attention of prescription drugs. But there has to be a remedy for this. 
   I appreciate we are talking now about a Medicare benefit that would include prescription drugs. But, frankly, the bipartisan agreement isn't there yet. I am hopeful it will be during the course of this short legislative year. 
   There are a lot of people out there who I think are cynical about how much Congress is going to accomplish this year given the fact it is a Presidential year, and all too often time is spent trying to paint differences, drawing lines and drawing the parties apart than coming together in a bipartisan kind of cooperation that I think the American public deserve and what they want to see happen. I think most Americans are not left- or right-wingers, but they want the Government to work fairly efficiently and come together on these key issues. 
   This is one where I believe we can find some common ground on--not necessarily with huge public expenditures, although if we are going to have a Medicare benefit in the end some additional budgetary implications are certainly involved. And, yes, I think it can be addressed without some massive bureaucracy. We can do that as well, although I worry some when I see these ``Flo ads'' on TV paid by the pharmaceutical industry having to hire an actress to portray a senior by the name of Flo who then goes on about her worries that somehow the Government might do something about prescription drugs and that would be having the Government enter the medicine chest. This is a fear tactic. It is designed to make people worry that if Congress does anything about the cost of prescription drugs somehow that will involve some sort of intrusive federalization of our health care. That is a foolish argument and, unfortunately, one that is backed by millions of dollars of TV ads and one that I think is cynical in terms of trying to dissuade people from believing that there are steps we can take so the United States no longer is the only democracy in the world paying the kind of bills that we pay. 
   I had a study done by one of our committees in the other body to look at the prescription drug costs in South Dakota, and to also look at costs around the world. This is no surprise. I have long heard talk about going to Winnipeg and going to Mexico to buy drugs for less. I thought perhaps that was anecdotal, and that perhaps it was a systemic situation, but in fact it is reality. 
   The recent studies indicate that if you go to Canada, or to Mexico, or to France, or to Britain, or to Germany, or to Italy, or to virtually any other industrialized democracy, the cost of prescription drugs is about half what it is in the United States. Nobody pays the kind of bills we pay in the United States. We pay about double what anybody else in the industrialized world pays. That to me is so utterly unacceptable and unfair. This all comes at a time of great national prosperity overall--though you wouldn't always know that in rural America. The great pharmaceutical industry is making profits running about three times higher than any other sector of the American economy. They are enormous profits. Of course, we always hear pleas that if we had to develop drugs at a reasonable price, as everything else in the world, that would negatively impact our ability to do research. It is nonsense. The profits being earned are far higher than a research budget. We want the pharmaceutical industry to make a reasonable profit. We want them to invest money in research. But they make money off research. That is what gives them new things to sell. 
   I don't think that some reduced cost for American citizens in line with what everyone else in the world is paying is going to have some sort of catastrophic consequence with the pharmaceutical industry at all. All we are looking at is a fair deal, one more consistent with what everybody else gets. 
   There are a couple of ways to approach this. Keeping in mind that if we do nothing not only is the current severe problem going to grow even worse, it is going to grow worse because the inflationary numbers for prescription drugs are increasingly going up far higher than the rate of inflation. 
   There are a couple of different responses that I think we could take in this that do not require us to wait around until we reach some sort of grand, bipartisan compromise under the entire revamping of Medicare. Something is going to have to be done long term about Medicare. We all know that. I am not sure if this is the year it is likely to happen as we get into sort of a Presidential-politics-strewn year and it doesn't even happen. We don't have to wait until then to do something. 
   I sponsored, with my colleague Senator KENNEDY, S. 731, the Prescription Drug Fairness For Seniors Act. 
   There is a corresponding bill in the House of Representatives, H.R. 664, with over 140 cosponsors. 
   This legislation simply says to the pharmaceutical industry that we will not set prices, we will not have a bureaucracy sitting in the basement of a building in Washington trying to figure out a fair profit. Some suggest that is what we ought to do. We have done that with utilities. Many States have public utility commissions. Recognizing there is no competition in certain sectors of America's economies, they set what a fair profit is and what the prices and profit will be. That is not where I am going with this legislation despite the fact many other countries do. 
   This legislation is consistent with free market. It is nonbureaucratic. It simply says to the pharmaceutical industry, if this industry is going to sell their products to other favored buyers, then cut Medicare beneficiaries, seniors and the disabled on Medicare, in on the deal, too. Right now a large HMO or Federal agency, is buying prescription drugs at 40 percent to 50 percent less than what everybody else in the U.S. is paying. 
   This proposal does not provide free drugs for anyone, but it does put American seniors and those disabled individuals on Medicare, who are the ones that purchase the majority of prescription drugs in this country, on the same playing field as citizens of other nations, who pay less. When the pharmaceutical industry sells their products to favored customers such as large HMOs, Federal agencies, or other countries for that matter, they are not selling the drugs at a loss. They are making a very handsome profit. We are suggesting if that is enough profit for the industry from those customers, why not the same for American citizens? Why not give the same price system to American citizens? 
   Perhaps their negotiated price will go up; it cannot go higher than what it already is for American citizens. We are suggesting, do not discriminate against American citizens, and certainly not against American seniors. This legislation involves no price fixing, it involves no bureaucracy, it involves no tax dollars. 
   I am pleased in my home State of South Dakota, we now have over 5,000 citizens who have written to me asking to be named as ``Citizen Cosponsors''  my legislation, S. 731, the Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act. I invite other people and my fellow colleagues who believe we need to do something about this issue now, who believe there should be no discrimination against American seniors, to join me as a Citizen Cosponsor. Contact me at my office in Washington. I am happy to sign citizens and my colleagues on. We will indicate to the world this is not an issue that will go away. It is an issue that has enormous grass roots support and one that we can do something now about to help with the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. 
   We have a second bill, as well, that Senator DORGAN, my colleague from North Dakota, has been the principal sponsor of that takes a somewhat similar tact--again, involving no bureaucracy, no tax dollars. I call it ``what is good for the goose is good for the gander'' legislation, but the formal name of the bill is the International Prescription Drug Parity Act, S. 1191. 
   This legislation says if companies sell these drugs to Canada, Mexico, or elsewhere, allow our pharmacies to reimport these drugs back into the United States. Currently, a citizen can go to these other countries and pick up about a month's supply of drugs for their own personal use, but that is it. 
   We would monitor the drugs to make sure they are not tampered with; that is not an insurmountable problem. 
   In effect, every other country in the Western World seems to have found a way to address this issue, except the U.S. The world's greatest democracy, the world's greatest economic and military power, is the only country that seems not to have found something to address these costs. We say let the drugs be imported back into the United States. We will ride piggyback on the progressive policies of other countries where the drugs have been 
   sold for profit, but are branded FDA-approved drugs; bring them back into the United States. Why should South Dakotans have to get on a bus and go to Winnipeg? Why should they have to take a side trip during the wintertime to Mexico? Why should any of this be necessary? This is foolishness. We deserve far better. 
   There are some who say this is common sense; why is there any controversy? The resistance to some of this legislation has been fierce. The pharmaceutical industry has been running attack ads against my colleagues in the other body who have sponsored this legislation. Television ads, radio ads, and print ads can be intimidating. I am hopeful we can sit down at the table together. 
   I don't want to demonize or villainize the pharmaceutical industry. We are proud of the research and development that they do. We want them to continue doing that. We want them to continue to make a profit. This is not some sort of confiscatory plan. We want them to sit down in good faith. If not, we will proceed anyway. This issue has become too serious. It has to do with the health care integrity of our Nation. 
   I believe we can make progress with these two middle-of-the-road kind of bills, while at the same time working with the President who, to his great credit, has been talking about ways we can add Medicare prescription drug coverage to our health care system in this country. If we do that, we will have resolved one of the most severe problems our country faces this year. 
   We need to go on to broader range Medicare reforms. There are things that will have to happen with Social Security, as well. We all know that and hopefully we can reach some bipartisan resolution of those issues. In the meantime, every single day that goes by, there are South Dakota seniors and disabled individuals with high prescription drug bills, seniors from all over the country, who are skipping meals, who are not taking the drugs they should be taking, who are making terrible choices that the citizens of the world's richest democracy should not be compelled to make. It is just unconscionable that people are given these choices. We should not have to make those decisions. We should not have people showing up with acute illnesses in our emergency room where taxpayers then pick up the tab because they were not able to afford the prescription drugs they need. 
   There are a great many core issues we need to debate this year, from world trade issues to the scope and the nature of the Federal budget, to education and so on. However, I submit that among the very top tier of issues we need to resolve before this Congress goes home this fall, before it returns to more politics and campaigning, is to take up these two bills and to pass needed legislation to address the issue of prescription drug affordability. 
   I have no ego involved in the sponsorship here. We need to deal constructively now, this year, with the cost of prescription drugs, certainly for seniors, and hopefully for the entire American public. If we do that, this will have been a year well spent. 
   I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to inform my colleagues of a recent act of great charity by one of my constituents, Ms. Debbie Laakso of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. 
   In an astonishing act of kindness, the single mother of four donated a kidney to her friend and former boss, Verle Jucht. The odd twist is that Debbie and Verle met at John Morrell and Company where Verle was Debbie's supervisor. Though they separated as colleagues in 1993, they surprisingly remained friends for the last six years. When Verle's kidney began to fail last year, Debbie gave him hers. Knowing her jovial nature, Verle and his wife, Colleen, thought their old friend was kidding when she first offered to donate. 
   Luckily, Debbie and Verle were a match, and after surgery last November, both are doing well. This story, Mr. President, is a great testament to the truly good and giving nature of people. I rise today to thank Debbie Laakso for her good nature and good humor and to congratulate her and Verle Jucht on their bravery and courage. Debbie serves as a model of goodness and friendship for all Americans, and their story is an account for all of the importance of the ``Gift of Life.''

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my good friend, the Honorable Ikram U. Khan, M.D. 
   I have had the honor of knowing Ikram for several years and I am fortunate we have developed a good friendship. Because of that friendship, I am doubly pleased that Ikram has been appointed by President Clinton to the Board of Regents for the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. 
   This is an extremely prestigious appointment, one that Ikram richly deserves. During his twenty-one years of private practice, he has served not only his patients and the institution of medicine, but also his community and state. He has been honored by his hometown of Las Vegas and various local organizations for his community service and achievements. He has been nominated to serve on Nevada's State Board of Medical Examiners and on the state Legislature's Health Care Cost Containment committee. On the national scene, Congresswoman Barbara Vucanovich, in 1993, asked Ikram to adviser her on health care delivery issues specific to Medicare, and President Clinton, in 1995, recognized Ikram for his health care reform efforts. He is a very fine man, and his years of dedication to military medicine and to the health industry in general ensures he will perform a great service in this position. 
   Mr. President, I would like to again congratulate my friend, Dr. Ikram Khan, on his appointment to the Board of Regents and wish him the best on his new challenges managing the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences. I trust the University and Secretary Cohen will find him a valuable asset and a skilled adviser.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly congratulate two of my constituents, Mr. Leonard Lone Hill and Mr. Warren Giago, both of Porcupine, SD. I am pleased to announce to my colleagues that Mr. Lone Hill and Mr. Giago, partners in Thunder Cloud Construction, a Porcupine-based construction company, have been honored by the Small Business Administration as winners of the 1999 Minority Small Business People of the Year for South Dakota. As my colleagues may know, Porcupine is located in Shannon County on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Highlighted by the President during his New Markets Initiative tour, Shannon County is the poorest county in the country. 
   Thunder Cloud Construction is working to reverse the trend of Native American poverty on the Reservation by not only hiring minority workers, but by providing on-the-job training for new, unskilled employees. The activities of the company and its two owners, result not only in participation in the development of community infrastructure and resources but also a substantial contribution to economic growth and development of the Pine Ridge Reservation. Among its achievements, Thunder Cloud has recently completed a shelter for homeless children, the Casey Family Building. Following last years devastating tornadoes, the company won a substantial contract to build foundations and basements for twenty-two units of replacement housing. 
   Mr. President, Leonard Lone Hill and Warren Giago of Thunder Cloud Construction richly deserve this honor. After five years in business, they have twenty-two employees on the payroll and annual sales of $277,500. Their work has vastly improved the economic landscape of Porcupine and the Pine Ridge Reservation, and is a great model for other aspiring businessmen to follow. They have overcome many obstacles and I look forward to all of their future successes.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the passing of a dear friend and counselor, Mr. Wayne ``Haus'' Hauschild of Brookings, South Dakota.  
   Because of our state's immigrant past, many of my constituents are not originally from South Dakota. Wayne Hauschild is a good example. Born and raised in Davenport, Iowa, it wasn't until 1954 that, after graduating from Saint Ambrose College and serving in the U.S. Navy, he settled in Brookings. For his remaining forty-six years, Wayne Hauschild served the community of Brookings in many capacities. For a remarkable thirty-nine years, he taught high school U.S. history and government. In addition to his teaching duties, he coached high school basketball, football, golf, tennis, and the Brookings Cubs and American Legion baseball teams. 
   His government service began as a representative to the South Dakota State Legislature where he served five terms from 1971 to 1980. Though he retired from teaching in 1993, he remained a faithful servant of the public, serving as Brookings mayor from 1993 to 1999, presiding over Brookings changed to the city manager form of municipal government. 
   Whenever someone mentions Wayne Hauschild, I think of dedication. As a State Legislator and as Brookings mayor, he was dedicated to improving the lives of his neighbors and his fellow South Dakotans. As a teacher of thirty-nine years, he was dedicated to educating young people, and ensuring they remember the importance of civic participation and the lessons of history when that fundamental right is deprived. As a coach, he was dedicated to instilling the values of sportsmanship, fairplay, and hardwork. As all these things, he was always a father and a husband, dedicated to his family. I will truly miss him, because, to me, he was always a dedicated friend. 
   Mr. President, this is a sad time where we are forced to bid farewell to a man who was a fixture of the Brookings community for the last forty-six years. However, this is also a time when we can remember a dedicated man who led a truly extraordinary life, no matter the measure.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator PAUL COVERDELL and Senator JOHN MCCAIN today in introducing the Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act. This legislation honors our nation's commitment to the men and women who served in the military by upholding the promise of health care coverage in return for their selfless dedication. 
   Last year, the Senate began to address critical recruitment and retention problems currently facing our nation's armed services. The pay table adjustments and retirement reform enacted in the fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense Authorization bill were both long overdue improvements for our active duty military personnel. However, these improvements do not solve our country's difficulty in recruiting and keeping the best and the brightest in the military. In order to maintain a strong military for now and in the future, our country must show that it will honor its commitment to military retirees and veterans as well. 
   For years, men and women who joined the military were promised lifetime health care coverage for themselves and their dependents. Prior to June 7, 1956, no statutory health care plan existed for military personnel. Even when the Civilian Health and Medical Program for the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) was enacted that year, the health care coverage was dependent upon the space available at military treatment facilities. Post-Cold War downsizing, base closures, and the reduction of health care services at military bases have limited the health care options available to military retirees. 
   In my home state of South Dakota, I have heard from many military retirees who are forced to drive hundreds of miles to receive care. As a final disgrace, military retirees are currently kicked off the military's Tricare health care system when they turn 65. This is a slap in the face to those men and women who have sacrificed their livelihood to keep our country safe from threats at home and abroad. 
   The Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act restores adequate health care coverage to all military retirees. For those retirees who entered the armed services before June 7, 1956, when CHAMPUS was created, my legislation will honor the promise of health care coverage for life. This will be accomplished by allowing military retirees to enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), with the United States paying 100 percent of the costs. Military retirees who joined the armed services after space-available care was enacted into law in 1956 will be allowed to enroll in FEHBP or continue to participate in Tricare--even after they turn 65. These military retirees who choose to enroll in FEHBP will pay the same premiums and fees as all other federal employees in the program. 
   The Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act has been endorsed by the National Military and Veterans Alliance and its member organizations. Companion legislation in the House of Representatives already has over 220 bipartisan cosponsors thanks to unprecedented grassroots support by military retirees nationwide. 
   A promise made should be a promise kept. We owe it to our country's military retirees to provide them with the health care they were promised. These men and women stood ready to answer the call to defend our rights, anytime and anywhere. It is now our duty to answer their calls for better health care. 
   We also owe it to ourselves to help attract and keep qualified men and women in our military by showing potential recruits and active duty personnel that our country honors its commitment to those who serve it. We have a long way to go, but I will continue to work to make sure our country's active duty personnel, military retirees, and veterans receive the benefits they deserve.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to address an issue of critical importance to millions and millions of Americans, an issue I have come to the floor previously to discuss and an issue that has become one of my highest legislative priorities, the lack of affordable prescription drugs. 
   Today, nearly thirty five percent of Medicare beneficiaries, 14 million people, have absolutely no coverage for prescription drugs. Unfortunately, these are also the same individuals who consume the majority of prescription drugs in our country. Studies indicate that eighty percent of retirees take at least one prescription drug every day and those over the age of sixty-five take on average, eighteen and a half prescription drugs per year. 
   Older Americans spend a tremendous amount of money out of pocket on their health care expenses. It is estimated that seniors spend an average of fourteen percent on hospital admission costs, thirty one percent on physician visits, thirty four percent on prescription drugs and twenty one percent on other health care related expenses. Prescription drugs have become the number one health care expense for senior citizens in our country. 
   I came to the floor a few weeks ago to talk about this very same issue, but I am addressing this issue again because I believe this matter is too critical for Congress to ignore. It appears as though Congress will not reach an agreement before we adjourn for the year, or even have a meaningful discussion, on how we will provide relief to the millions of needy seniors throughout our country and my state of South Dakota who struggle every day to pay for their medications. 
   While prices for the prescription drugs most often used by older Americans are skyrocketing far beyond inflation, recently the pharmaceutical industry reveled in record breaking stock prices and an announcement of a proposed multi-billion dollar merger between Warner Lambert and American Home Products. This proposed deal would form the biggest merger in the history of the drug industry and create the largest drug maker in the world. The transaction between Warner Lambert and American Home Products is worth nearly seventy three billion dollars, billions more than the federal government spends on most of their thirteen individual appropriation bills. 
   News of this proposed merger, prompted another drug industry giant, Pfizer, Inc. to announce a counter offer to buy Warner Lambert at a cost of eighty two and a half billion dollars. 
   On the heels of the pharmaceutical industry's financial exploits, ``Families USA: The Voice for Health Care Consumers'' recently released a report indicating that more than two thirds of the fifty most commonly prescribed drugs for seniors increased in price nearly two to three times faster than the rate of inflation. Last 
   year, wholesale prices for fifty prescriptions commonly filled by the elderly rose by six and a half percent even though the overall inflation rate that year was just one and a half percent. 
   For example, the drug Lorazepam, used to treat Parkinson's disease, increased three hundred and eighty five percent over the last five years. The report also found that while the median profit for all Fortune five hundred companies was four and a half percent, manufacturers of drugs most commonly prescribed to seniors relished in profits at or above twenty percent in 1998. 
   The findings in the Families USA study reflect similar results that I found in a study that I had requested from the House Government Reform Committee on drug prices paid by South Dakota seniors. 
   The South Dakota study found that South Dakota's elderly pay more than twice as much for their prescription drugs as does a pharmaceutical company's favored customers, such as HMO's, large insurance companies or the federal government. The study found that price differentials are as high as one thousand four hundred and sixty nine percent for some drugs. 
   For the last several months, I have been holding meetings in communities across South Dakota on the subject of prescription drug prices. The response from seniors and young people alike on this issue has been overwhelming to say the least. 
   I have received nearly five thousand postcards and hundreds more letters in response to my request for South Dakotans to contact me with their opinions on this issue. I have asked South Dakotans to become a Citizen Cosponsor of the prescription drug legislation that I introduced with Senator KENNEDY, called the Prescription Drug Fairness For Seniors Act''. Our bill would allow Medicare beneficiaries access to the same low prescription drug prices that the drug companies offer their ``favored'' customers, such as HMO's, large insurance companies and the federal government. This bill ends the price discrimination that now exists against the segment of the society who rely on prescription drugs the most, older Americans. South Dakotans have told me that they support this effort to make prescription drugs affordable. 
   Mr. President, we are forcing our senior citizens to make the unimaginable choice between ``heating and eating'' or buying their medication. This is a choice that no human being should have to make. 
   With the proposed drug industry merger between Warner Lambert and American Home Products, and the recently released Families USA study, today highlights two more examples which reinforces my belief that we need legislation to help lower the high cost of prescription drugs for American consumers. 
   A seventy three billion dollar drug industry merger has the potential to decrease any competition that still exists in the industry. Stock prices for the pharmaceutical industry are at an all time high which adds to their record profits. The losers for all of this are the American consumers who are forced to pay increasingly higher prices for prescription drugs. 
   By joining forces, these two drug companies expect a total cost savings of over one billion dollars over three years by spreading the cost of developing new drugs, while increasing the sales force needed to market old and new products. If this merger deal goes through, I wonder if the drug companies would be willing to pass along any of their one billion dollar savings to the thousands of seniors that I have heard from across South Dakota who cannot afford their monthly medication bills? 
   I ask that a summary of the Families USA study be inserted into the RECORD following my statement.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from South Dakota, Senate Democratic Leader TOM DASCHLE, as a cosponsor of the Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Place Act, which will establish the Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Place in Ft. Pierre, South Dakota. The Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Place would be an important cultural and interpretive center, in part to compliment the National Lewis and Clark Trail, but with the unique perspective of the Sioux tribes and the impact of the Lewis and Clark encounter on tribal culture and economics. 
   During the Lewis and Clark expedition, Captains Merriweather Lewis and William Clark anchored their river boats where the Wakpa Sica, or Bad River, flows into the Missouri. After four months of travel from St. Louis, history was made on September 24, 1804. The next day 44 men landed on the west bank of the Missouri and paraded under the United States flag. 
   These men then joined Chief Black Buffalo and braves from the Teton Sioux for council in the chief's buffalo skin lodge. This was a key and pivotal meeting between representatives of the great Sioux tribes and those of the United States of America. This meeting was less than amicable. 
   Throughout the rest of South Dakotas history the relationship between native peoples and non-natives has not been a peaceful one. Today we are still facing the challenging experience of working and living together side by side. I am proud of the South Dakotans  who set their differences aside and came together and created the Mni Wiconi water project. There is a growing need for a Reconciliation Place. 
   The Reconciliation Place would occupy the site in which Captains Lewis and Clark, and the members of the tribes came together to meet for the first time--which is a fitting site to bring Indian and non-Indian peoples together. It is my hope that this center will bring people together to learn about the culture and the rich history this area of the United States holds. Through this understanding, it is my hope that we may be able to achieve better relations between Tribal and non-Tribal peoples. 
   This project is a cultural center which will serve as a home for Sioux law, history, culture and arts for the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota peoples. It will also serve as a repository for Sioux historical documents, which are currently scattered throughout the West. Many native people do not have access to these documents. With the construction of this facility the native people will be able to house these documents close to home. This will allow interested parties to research their rich past. 
   The Reconciliation Place will also be the home of the Sioux Nation Supreme Court. This will serve to be a stable legal setting to assist in achieving greater social and economic welfare in Indian Country. Increased legal stability will help promote business investment in the vast human resources that are situated on the reservations in my state. This will bring about more self sufficiency, and less reliance by tribes on the federal government. Similarly, the Native American Economic Development Council will be located in this same facility. This council will assist tribes and tribal members to provide opportunities for economic development. The council will assist in opening the doors to private investment and other resources that are designed to promote development and job creation.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President. I would like to alert my colleagues to an issue raised by H.R. 434, the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin Initiative, regarding trade with Israel under the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Area Agreement. Notwithstanding our free-trade agreement with Israel, the CBI provisions of this legislation would unfairly discriminate against U.S. imports from Israel. 
   Under that legislation, most U.S. textile products made with Israeli inputs, such as yarn, fabric or thread, would not be eligible for duty free treatment when assembled into apparel in the Caribbean. To illustrate the contrast with current law, today, if a U.S. company uses Israeli yarn in manufacturing fabric, the products made from such fabric would be eligible for CBI benefits. The trade bill creates a unilateral change from the status quo in our trade with Israel and a major barrier to U.S. companies using Israeli-origin inputs.

   Mr. JOHNSON. I do not think that it is the intent of the CBI legislation to undermine our trade with Israel. Preserving our existing trade with Israel will not in any way lessen the trade benefits we extend to the CBI countries. And it is critically important that we consider our existing trade agreement with Israel as we develop further trade measures. I urge my colleagues to address this issue as this bill moves forward, so that we do not prejudice our trade with Israel under the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Area Agreement.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which would increase the acreage cap currently in place for the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) under the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
   CRP continues to be a popular alternative for landowners who wish to take a portion of their land out of production for conservation purposes. While the program serves a multitude of beneficial purposes, there are items of the program that we must continue to work on in Congress. As a start, I am introducing companion legislation to Congressman COLLIN PETERSON's (D-MN) bill in the House to increase the acreage allotted in CRP up to 45 million acres. 
   CRP has undergone significant changes as a result of the 1996 Farm Bill. Wildlife benefits provided by certain grass species and conservation practices are now heavily emphasized in the Environmental Benefits Index (EBI) which sets forth eligibility into the program. While many of these changes have been welcomed because of the favorable effect they have on conservation and the environment, I have some concerns with certain requirements farmers face in relation to the EBI requirements. 
   First, producers with existing CRP contracts that have tracts of land accepted for re-enrollment into CRP have indicated that in certain cases, they were required to plow under at least half of the existing grass stand on those tracts in order to plant new grass seeds to meet the EBI criteria. Those participants are concerned this may lead to soil erosion instead of soil conservation on tracts that are already highly erodible because plowing up half of grass stand exposes that land to the unpredictable forces of weather. Moreover, it often requires more than one growing season for new grass species to take root and establish adequate cover in order to protect habitat. That said, both producers and conservationists have expressed concern to me that this requirement may place habitat protection in a precarious position in some instances. Finally, the costs of seed varieties called for in the EBI, especially for native grass species, have skyrocketed to a point here it is oftentimes cost-prohibitive for producers to meet the requirements of establishing a new grass stand. These and other matters I plan to address with the input of all interested parties as we proceed with the legislation. 
   However, on the whole CRP remains a very popular program in my home state of South Dakota and across the country. During the twelve signups held between 1986 and 1992, 36.4 million acres were enrolled in CRP. USDA estimates that the average erosion rate on enrolled acres was reduced from 21 to less than 2 tons per acre per year. Retiring these lands also expanded wildlife habitat, enhanced water quality, and restored soil. The annual value of these benefits has been estimated from less than $1 billion to more than $1.5 billion; some estimates of these benefits approach or exceed annual costs, especially in areas of heavy participation. While major changes cannot occur to CRP until we undertake a renewed effort to change the Farm Bill, I am hopeful that Congress reconsider the current Farm Bill in 2000. 
   In addition to supporting CRP, I have co-sponsored S. 1426, the Conservation Security Act of 1999. This bill creates a voluntary incentive program to encourage conservation activities by landowners. This bill includes a variety of solid conservation practices that landowners may choose from in order to qualify for certain incentives. Some of the conservation practices include conservation tillage, runoff control, buffer strips, wetland restoration, and wildlife management. 
   I believe the Conservation Security Act is a strong piece of legislation that would benefit agriculture producers, wildlife, and the environment. I will continue to support and work with Senator HARKIN in seeing this legislation move forward.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support and cosponsorship to S. 1452, the Manufactured Housing Improvement Act. Rural America, and my state of South Dakota in particular, is in the midst of an affordable housing crunch. In South Dakota, approximately four of ten new single family homes are manufactured homes, and with an average cost of around $42,000, manufactured homes enable many individuals, young families, and retired South Dakotans to enjoy the benefits of homeownership. Nearly one-quarter of the new homes nationwide are manufactured homes, and an estimated 8% of the American population lives in manufactured homes. 
   Despite the increasing number of manufactured homes, the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act has not been updated since its creation in 1974. Over the past twenty five years, manufactured homes have evolved from being predominately mobile trailers to permanent structures that contain the same amenities found in site-built homes. The inability of regulations to keep pace with changing technology and the nature of manufactured housing frustrates manufactured housing builders and consumers alike.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my appreciation for the hard work of Julie Roling, a Brookings Institution Fellow who has worked as part of my staff for the past six months. Julie has been a tremendous asset to my legislative staff, and I am fortunate to have had her assistance. When she returns to the National Security Agency in December, I know she will be missed by me and my staff. 
   Very often, Brookings Fellows have reputations that precede them in Capitol Hill offices. Known as some of the best and brightest government employees, they are considered secret weapons to the Members they assist. Julie has been no exception. She came to my office with a wealth of government experience and policy knowledge, as well as a model work ethic and positive attitude. While her expertise lies in defense procurement, Julie welcomed projects in a broad array of new issue areas and contributed a great deal to my legislative staff. 
   Throughout the past six months, Julie has worked on a number of projects dealing with the environment, natural resources, agriculture and trade. Julie led research efforts regarding a controversial wetlands policy during her time in my office. The unfortunate circumstances surrounding this issue pitted the interests of agricultural producers against environmental groups. It was imperative that my staff and I have access to the most recent information, in order to effectively address the concerns of my constituents. Julie's research provided my office with up-to-date and unbiased information that enabled me to communicate clearly with both farmers and environmentalists during this time. Julie handled frequent communication with government agencies and almost daily communications with South Dakotans. 
   Julie also provided valuable assistance on crop insurance legislation this year as well. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate introduced numerous bills to reform the crop insurance program in this Congress, an issue of great importance to the farmers of South Dakota. Julie collected and synthesized information that enabled me and my staff to decide which crop insurance reform bills most effectively addressed the concerns of South Dakota farmers. 
   One of the most challenging tasks Julie undertook was the creation of a comprehensive resource guide regarding restructuring of the electricity industry. The end result of Julie's work was a thorough index of restructuring terms, industry positions, key issues and legislative proposals. Anyone who is familiar with the complexity of deregulation proposals can appreciate the hard work and attention to detail required to create such a resource, which will be invaluable to me as the Senate Energy Committee continues to discuss and evaluate restructuring legislation. 
   Again, I wish to express my deep gratitude to Julie for a job well done. I wish her the very best in her future endeavors.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to David A. Jungemann, a U.S. Air Force retiree with over 22 years of active military service and a great citizen from South Dakota who recently completed a very successful two-year term as Chairman of The Retired Enlisted Association TREA Senior Citizens League TSCL Board of Trustees. During his chairmanship, TSCL expanded its efforts to defend and protect the earned retirement benefits of older Americans. Through his leadership, TSCL was successful in expanding its legislative lobbying goals and objectives and, as a result, increased the League's membership from 600,000 to over 1.5 million members and supporters in just two years. 
   Dave was born on November 11, 1938 in Wolsey, SD. He graduated from Wolsey High School in May 1956, and in the following month, enlisted in the United States Air Force (USAF) and headed for Parks Air Force Base, California, for Basic Training. During his military career, Dave was stationed in Colorado, Texas, Florida, California, and Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota. His military career also took him to many overseas locations including Japan, Guam, and Thailand. During a nine-month period of Temporary Duty to Andersen Air Force Base on the island of Guam, he served in support of the ARC Light Missions over the Republic of Vietnam and in 1968, flew 10 combat missions over Vietnam as a Bomb/Navigation Systems Technician. His service gave him the opportunity to earn the Bronze Star Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal with one oak leaf cluster, and numerous other awards and decorations. 
   With his military career behind him, Dave worked for the Douglas School System for over 14 years and subsequently retired from service to the State of South Dakota. During this period, he also served a two-year term as City Councilman for the City of Box Elder, South Dakota, and currently serves as Trustee for the Zion Lutheran Church in Rapid City, South Dakota. 
   What is truly remarkable about Dave Jungemann is that in addition to all the accomplishments I just mentioned, he still made time to contribute to the success of TREA and the TREA Senior Citizens League. For instance, he served on the TREA Chapter 29 Board of Directors for 9 years and the TSCL Board of Trustees for 4 years, during which time he completed a two-year term as Chairman. Even today, Dave still participates in numerous parades and ceremonies to honor the veterans of the United States of America. 
   Today I rise in recognition of a great American, a solid citizen of South Dakota and a man who is a symbol of service to God, Country, State, veterans and older Americans. Congratulations on your accomplishments, Dave, and I wish you a Happy Birthday this coming Veterans' Day, a fitting time to celebrate the life of a distinguished American veteran.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, when I first came to Congress in 1987, efforts at financial services modernization had already been undertaken and failed many times. Last year, we came as close as Congress has ever come to achieving this critical goal. This year, as a member of the conference committee, I am pleased to say, we will finally accomplish this historic goal. 
   That we are here is a testament to the leadership of many, many participants. Much credit goes to Chairman LEACH, who tirelessly shepared this bill over his five years as chairman of the House Banking Committee and chairman of this conference. Senator GRAMM, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee relentlessly promoted his agenda, yet was willing to compromise on critical issues in a manner that resulted ultimately in bipartisan support of this bill. 
   My ranking member on the Banking Committee, Senator SARBANES, made invaluable contributions to the process. His tenaciousness, in depth understanding of the many highly complex issues, and ability to work within the caucus made this success possible. Of course, the ranking member on the House Banking Committee, Representative LAFALCE, and our friends from the House Commerce Committee, Chairman BLILEY and Representative DINGELL, made critical contributions to this process as well. Finally, I would note the active involvement of two Secretaries of the Treasury, Bob Rubin and Larry Summers. Bob has moved on to other things, but the role he forged in this process has been seamlessly filled by Secretary Summers. 
   There are many highlights to this bill. By eliminating the Glass-Steagall restrictions, we free our financial services industry to maintain its place as the world leader. The benefits of one-stop shopping will make financial services more accessible to all Americans. These reasons alone are sufficient to support this legislation. There are several other provisions to this bill that merit discussion, and they strengthen this legislation. First, the unitary thrift loophole is closed. I am pleased to have offered this critical amendment which closes the loophole that permits a dangerous combination of banking and commerce. While we tear down firewalls within financial services, we strengthen them around financial services. 
   Under current law, commercial firms can own and operate unitary thrifts. That is the only breach of the banking and commerce firewalls currently allowed under our financial services law. Of course, the Glass-Steagall repeal and other components of this legislation will open a range of financial activities to each other. However, the bill is carefully structured to prevent the mixing of banking and commerce. This single loophole remains where banking and commerce can mix. The conference report does not interfere with current ownership of thrifts. Any commercial firms that currently own a unitary thrift charter will be able to continue to own and operate their institutions without restriction. Their current status would be undisturbed. 
   The only limitation this amendment would impose involves the transferability of that charter. The charter would not be transferable to another commercial entity. Any bank, insurance company or security firm that wanted to acquire the charter could do so. A new entity could be created to operate the thrift. Included in title IV of the bill before us are provisions prohibiting new unitary thrift holding company applications filed after May 4, 1999, and prohibiting transfer of existing unitaries to commercial firms. In the context of comprehensive financial modernization legislation, these provisions achieve the intent of this Congress to block the inappropriate mixing of banking and commerce, even in the limited scope authorized for the thrift industry for the past several decades. The provisions in title IV protect granfathered companies but do not allow existing unitary companies to be acquired by commercial firms. By adopting my amendment in this conference report, it is the intent of Congress that the thrift regulator strictly enforce this provision and related laws which carefully define which companies qualify as unitary holding companies and which companies are grandfathered in this legislation. Only the current, limited universe of legitimate unitaries should be allowed 
   to exercise powers granted them in the Home Owners Loan Act, and transfer of unitaries to commercial firms will no longer threaten American taxpayers. 
   This provision will further the goals of financial modernization by leveling the playing field between banks and thrifts. It will also remove a dangerous threat to further weakening of the walls between banking and commerce. This bipartisan effort had the support of Secretary Summers and Chairman Greenspan. It overwhelmingly passed the full Senate. Representative LARGENT shepherded it through the House Commerce Subcommittee on Finance and Hazardous Material. Our joint efforts helped make this protection part of the conference report. We also improve the Federal Home Loan Bank System, creating greater access to wholesale capital markets for small banks and their customers. The improvements to the Home Loan Bank System will directly help South Dakota financial institutions and South Dakota consumers by making it easier for our institutions to join the Federal Home Loan Bank System. This portion of the bill recognizes the importance of small community banks and the role they plan in our towns and communities. With the massive shift of savings and investment to Wall Street and other nontraditional vehicles, small community banks are finding it more difficult to attract deposits at reasonable rates, and lack ready access to wholesale capital markets. 
   This bill will give them that access by making it easier for small banks to join the Federal Home Loan Bank System. That system gives small banks greater access to cheaper funds through wholesale capital rates. That access, in turn, will lead to more loans at lower rates to our small businesses, ranchers and farmers. It makes running a farm or ranch, running a business, expanding a business, buying a car, sending children to college--all of these endeavors more affordable for all South Dakotans, for all Americans. By enabling more affordable loans, this provision will help infuse the rural economy with capital in particular. This section of financial services modernization legislation is critical to keeping our community banks competitive as we move to tear down traditional firewalls and create new financial services giants within the realm of the financial service industries. 
   I want to briefly address the issue of financial privacy. With the explosive growth of the Internet, we are finding information can be accumulated and acquired with greater ease than previously imaginable. We must address this important consumer protection issue of financial privacy. I joined my colleagues, Senators BRYAN and SHELBY, in supporting an ``opt-out'' provision that would allow customers to prohibit their financial institutions from sharing their personal information. That effort failed and I am disappointed. We do add some new standards, including mandated disclosure of privacy policies and protection of certain critical information in the bill. I believe we can do better. I am pleased that we allow states to enact tougher privacy laws, establishing a minimum federal standard of financial privacy, but we can do better. Despite my disappointment, I am pleased we took the first steps in addressing financial privacy, and I believe Congress will revisit the privacy issue in the future. 
   It is critical as we move toward repeal of depression-era limitations that we recognize the vital role of community banks in rural areas. This legislation successfully frees our dominant providers to compete globally while strengthening the role of our community banks directly responsive to our small towns. It is that successful balancing that prompted me to sign the conference report, and I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this historic legislation. 
   I also want to take this opportunity to thank my staff, Paul Nash, for his tireless work on this legislation. His  dedication to this effort helped make the final product the balanced result which we will pass today. 
   I yield back such time as may remain.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the memory of a departed friend and trusted advisor, Harry VandeMore of Canton, South Dakota; a lifelong advocate for veterans and the citizens of Lincoln County, South Dakota. 
   Harry's dedication to community began with his own service in the Seventh Infantry Division of the United States Army. He served meritoriously on the frontlines of the Korean War, earning the Combat Infantryman Badge for Excellent Performance. Unfortunately, on October 14, 1952, he received serious combat injuries to the face, left arm, and left leg. For two years, he underwent thirty surgeries at Denver's Fitzsimmons Army Hospital to mend his injuries. As a result of his injuries, he was awarded the Purple Heart. 
   After being discharged, he returned to Hudson, South Dakota, where he married Rose Ann McNamara, his wife of forty-four years, and farmed the lands of Hudson with his parents and brothers. Community was second only to his family. Harry always brought his family to events he attended. Many people who worked with Harry knew his children just as well. 
   Harry dedicated his life to veterans ``because he went through it,'' according to Rose, his wife. His first service was to help the returning Vietnam War veterans who were facing mass rejection. Harry was honored by his peers when he was elected to the Disabled American Veterans National Executive Committee for the Fourteenth District, gaining wide respect serving a four-state region. His dedication was also present with his eighteen years on the state D.A.V. Executive Committee where he served as state commander; with his years as American Legion Post Commander in Hudson; and as president of the South Dakota Veteran's Council. 
   Many have dedicated their life only to this very important cause, but Harry also served the whole community with seven years as chairman of the Hudson School Board and his years on the Lincoln County Planning and Zoning Commission. It was on the commission where he helped make roads safer for fellow farmers because they were farm-to-market roads. 
   Harry was always a valuable citizen-counsel to me. He always helped to keep me abreast of veterans' hardships during my days as a state legislator, then as a member of the House, and  now, during my service in the U.S. Senate. I will forever miss his perspective on the uniquely tragic situation many of America's servicemen and women are in today. His life is a model to all South Dakotans and all Americans. 
   Harry VandeMore will be missed. He served by dedicating his life to his community and comrades, leading by example. As a soldier, a farmer, a husband and father, and as a public servant, he served not only the veterans, who are too often passed over, but the entire community, so others would not have to go through hardship.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I offer my strong support for the fiscal year 2000 VA-HUD Appropriations Conference Report and am pleased to join my Senate colleagues in passing this important piece of legislation today. Rural America, and my state of South Dakota, is in the midst of an affordable housing shortage crisis. According to reports, 5.3 million Americans pay more then 50 percent in their annual income to rent or living in substandard conditions. This is unacceptable for a society as wealthy as ours, and we must make real progress now to improve housing conditions for all Americans. 
   Although I supported the VA-HUD Appropriations Bill on the Senate floor last month, I was disappointed that the bill failed to provide additional Section 8 rental assistance for the thousands of American families that desperately need it. Additional Section 8 rental assistance, like that proposed by the President, would have allowed 321 families in South Dakota to receive Section 8 vouchers to help them afford adequate housing. In addition, I objected to the elimination of the Community Builders program in the original bill. In South Dakota, Community Builders  have worked with local governments and housing authorities to provide needed rental assistance statewide. 
   I joined my Democratic colleagues on the Senate Banking and Housing Committee in writing to Chairman BOND and Ranking Member MIKULSKI, asking them to fund additional Section 8 vouchers and restore the Community Builders program during their negotiations with conferees from the House of Representatives. I am pleased that Chairman BOND and Ranking Member MIKULSKI were able to secure funding for an additional 60,000 Section 8 vouchers. The VA-HUD Appropriations Conference Report also reiterates the need for Community Builders in HUD to help bring important HUD programs to an increasing number of Americans. 
   This legislation will help address the affordable housing shortage in my state of South Dakota. Currently, South Dakota families in need of housing assistance spend an average of 9 months on a waiting list for current Section 8 vouchers. While not helping all of those in need, the additional Section 8 vouchers contained in the VA-HUD Appropriations Conference Report will begin to shorten the time it takes for low-income families to receive much needed assistance. 
   Community Builders will also be able to continue to work with South Dakota communities to increase access for affordable housing. In the past, Community Builders worked with the Northeastern Council of Governments in South Dakota to spread information to several northeastern counties on the services that HUD provides, and how to access these services. Community Builders have facilitated FHA loans for the construction of affordable homes in Rapid City, while also helping the Sioux Empire Housing Partnership become a HUD-approved housing counseling agency. The Community Builder program has begun to address the housing needs in historically underserved communities, including the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Community Builders have enabled tribal leaders to better utilize HUD's programs to the benefit of one of the most poor populations in the nation. 
   I would like to thank Chairman BOND and Ranking Member MIKULSKI for improving the VA-HUD Appropriations bill despite the strict budget constraints the committee faced. I believe it is a wise investment in our country's future when we ensure that our working families have adequate housing, and I look forward to continue working with my colleagues to find ways to help South Dakota families and families across the nation address their housing needs.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr President, I rise before you today to introduce legislation on behalf of Senators BOB KERREY, CHARLES GRASSLEY, CRAIG THOMAS, and myself. The RANCHER Act (Rural America Needs Competition to Help Every Rancher) is designed to reestablish a free, fair, and competitive market for independent livestock producers. 
   South Dakota family farmers and ranchers indicate to me that one of the most critical problems in agriculture today is the growing, unabated trend of agribusiness consolidation and concentration. Too often today, elected leaders overlook agricultural concentration with rhetoric and empty promises. But talk doesn't provide any assurance to a cow-calf producer in South Dakota worried about what he or she will sell feeder calves for this fall. Talk doesn't minimize the worries of a diversified farmer looking for competitive markets in which to sell his or her grain. And talk surely doesn't assure any feeder of livestock that he or she will have a fair opportunity to sell slaughter livestock in this concentrated market. 
   This bipartisan legislation would strengthen and amend Section 202 of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 by prohibiting meatpackers from owning livestock prior to purchase for slaughter. It does provide exceptions for farmers and ranchers who own and process livestock in a producer owned and controlled cooperative. 
   Mr. President, concern over meatpacker concentration is not new in the United States. Cartoons in the 1880s negatively depicted companies that pooled livestock together for sale as ``beef trusts'' engaging in monopolistic pricing behavior. In 1917 President Woodrow Wilson directed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate meatpackers to determine if they were leveraging too much power over the marketplace. 
   The FTC released a report in 1919 stating that the ``Big 5'' meatpackers (Armour, Swift, Morris, Wilson, and Cudahy) dominated with ``monopolistic  control of the American meat industry''. The FTC also found these meatpackers owned stockyards, rail car lines, cold storage plants, and other essential facilities for distributing food. This led to the Packers Consent Decree of 1920 which prohibited the Big 5 packers from engaging in retail sales of meat and forced them to divest of ownership interests in stockyards and rail lines. Then, Congress enacted the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 that--among other things--prohibited meatpackers from engaging in unfair, discriminatory, or deceptive pricing practices. 
   Unfortunately, we have allowed some in the meatpacking industry to once again dangerously choke free enterprise and market access. As in the past, producers again look to their elected leaders to take action. That is why I have introduced legislation in Congress to combat meatpacker concentration in livestock markets. My legislation will prohibit meatpackers from owning livestock for slaughter. 
   Within the last few weeks, we've heard from pork conglomerates Smithfield Foods, Murphy Farms, and Tyson Foods regarding Smithfield's intention to own all the hogs currently held by both Murphy and Tyson. If these deals are to go through, around 800,000 sows could be owned and controlled by Smithfield. Ask any pork producer, a breeding stock herd of this size could enable Smithfield to totally dominate the hog industry. 
   In response, we could seek a Department of Justice investigation of this deal, but it is clear to me that current anti-trust law may be simply too weak to stop a marriage of this nature. Some may believe we need trust busters with true grit in the Justice or Agriculture Departments to keep these deals from happening, but my experience in Congress tells me if we wait for this type of action, we won't have an independent farmer or rancher left--anywhere. 
   Mr. President, current anti-trust laws have failed to address concerns of livestock producers in the marketplace. Moreover, growing packer concentration creates an imbalance in bargaining power between a few meatpackers who buy livestock and several producers who sell livestock. The relative lack of buyers means the buying side of the market has much more power than the selling side. Envision an hourglass: it is wide at both ends and very narrow in the middle. The two wide ends aptly represent agricultural producers and consumers. The narrow middle of the hourglass is the number of processors and meatpackers that buy livestock from farmers and ranchers and then sell food to consumers. A decision on the part of one meatpacker may have a substantial effect on the marketplace. For instance, when Smithfield shut down the pork plant in Huron--formerly owned by American Foods Group--pork producers in South Dakota were left with merely a single market for their slaughter hogs in the state. Alternatively, a decision on the part of a livestock producer seller has little if any effect at all on price. What does this mean? It means the marketplace is not competitive. 
   Some so called experts'' in the industry claim that concentration leads to cheap prices for consumers. These experts believe concentration is simply unstoppable, and better yet, they point to the vertically integrated poultry industry as a successful guide or model for cattle and pork producers. They gloss over the real effects of concentration by touting economies of scale and productive efficiency. 
   Apologists for the corporate conglomerates can criticize my efforts to keep meatpackers from owning livestock if they want, but given a choice, I will side with a broad base of family farmers and ranchers over conglomerate agriculture any day. It boils down to whether we want independent producers in agriculture, or if we will yield to concentration and see farmers and ranchers become low wage employees on their own land. 
   Ultimately, if we continue to stand idle and watch control of the world's food supply fall into the hands of the few, consumers will be the real losers in terms of both retail cost and food safety. 
   So today, almost a century after President Teddy Roosevelt used a big stick to give livestock producers a square deal, we again face a choice between corporate takeover of agriculture and a fight for free enterprise. I proudly cast my lot with the free enterprise family farm and ranch agriculture that has served our country so well.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, agriculture across most of America is in a state of crisis. We are facing incredibly low livestock and grain prices, coupled with weather disasters in many parts of the country, all simultaneously. The legislation before us, as my colleague has noted so ably, is imperfect. Some have referred to it as throwing a leaking liferaft to a drowning person, and there is some truth to that. But it is urgent legislation. It is legislation we need to move forward because the need is immense and the urgency is critical. There is certainly no assurance, if we were to vote this particular bill down, that it would be back to us anytime soon or that it would come back to us in a better situation than it is now. 
   I think we need to recognize the inadequacies of the legislation, but at the same time that we move forward, we do so with a commitment to do better, still this Congress and in the coming year, to address the underlying problems that at least contributed to the crisis we have in rural America. Faulty agricultural policy brought to us by Freedom to Farm, combined with low prices, natural disasters, and weak export markets, resulted in an inadequate safety net--for family producers, in any event--across this country. 
   We have seen net farm income absolutely plummet from $53 billion in 1996 to $43.8 billion in 1999. Off-farm income in many of our States, including mine, South Dakota, is responsible for 80 to 90 percent of our family producers being able to stay 
   on the farm. If it were not for off-farm income, there would be an even more massive exodus off the farm and ranch than we are seeing. 
   Are there inadequacies in the bill? Certainly. I commend our colleagues, Senator COCHRAN, Senator STEVENS, Senator KOHL, and many others, for hard work on this legislation under circumstances that surely were trying, where the level of resources would certainly not permit what they would prefer to see happen. Nonetheless, I think we have to acknowledge we need a recommitment in this body and from our friends on the other side of the Capitol to address the underlying structural problems ag faces today. I believe that involves revisiting the Freedom to Farm legislation. I believe that involves strengthening our marketing loan capabilities. 
   I would like to see us pass my country-of-origin meat labeling legislation. I am still working with a bipartisan group of colleagues this week to put together legislation addressing vertical integration in the packing industry, so we do not turn our livestock producers into low-wage employees on their own land. I fear that is the road we are going down. 
   We have to address issues of trade, value-added agriculture, farmer-owned cooperatives, and crop insurance reform. All of these are issues that cry out for attention, above and beyond anything done in this legislation. 
   I do applaud the effort in this bill to include mandatory price reporting on the livestock side. I do applaud some modest funding, at least, for my school breakfast pilot project that is included in this bill. I am concerned, however, the process led us to legislation that involves a distribution process that may not be as equitable as what I think the American public deserves. I will quote briefly from an analysis by the Associated Press, Philip Brasher, where he observes:  
   Some of the largest, most profitable farms in the country would be among the biggest beneficiaries of Congress' $8.7 billion agricultural assistance package because it loosens rules that wee intended to target government payments to family-size operations. 
   An individual farm could claim up to $460,000 in subsidies a year--double the current restriction--and the legislation creates a new way for producers to get around even that limit. 
   The payment limits apply to two different programs: crop subsidies that vary according to fluctuations in commodity prices; and annual ``market transition'' payments, which were guaranteed to producers under the 1996 farm law. 
   Farmers are technically allowed to receive no more than $75,000 in crop subsidies and $40,000 a year in market transition payments under current law. But many farms, legally claim twice that much because they are divided into different entities. A husband and a wife, for example, can claim separate payments on the same farm. 
   The aid package would double those caps, so farms could get up to $300,000 in crop subsidies and $160,000 in market transition payments this year. 
   Last year, about 550 farmers nationwide claimed the maximum amount in crop subsidies, USDA officials said. 
   Critics of the looser payment rules fear they will encourage the consolidation of farms and hasten the demise of smaller-scale operations. ``Big farms will use the extra cash to buy up land from the neighbors, driving up land prices in the process,'' said Chuck Hassebrook, program director of the Center for Rural Affairs in Walthill, NE. 
   ``What is the purpose of these farm programs? Is it to help very wealthy, very large landowners get bigger and get richer?''  
   These are the kinds of questions and concerns many of us have. I think they are profound questions, having to do with the very nature of agriculture, the very nature of rural America. What road we are going down, in terms of ag and rural policy in America, policy responsible for feeding so efficiently and so effectively and in such an extraordinary manner the people of our Nation? 
   But for all its failings and shortcomings, many of which I briefly raised this morning, the fact is there is absolute urgency this legislation go forward, that we address the problems of income collapse, disaster all over America, with this legislation; and, hopefully, upon passage of this legislation, we recommit ourselves to going expeditiously forward to address the remainder of these other issues I have raised, and others of my colleagues have raised, reflecting upon the inadequacies and inefficiencies and the shortcomings of this legislation. They are many. But to stop this legislation now would only hasten the demise of still more family producers all across America. It would not guarantee a return to a better policy anytime very soon. We need to pass this bill, then go forward with additional legislation to redress these inadequacies. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on passage of this legislation and to work with us in a bipartisan fashion on the remainder of these agricultural issues and budget issues before the country. 
   I yield.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the United States Senate has the opportunity to take another important step in ridding the world of the threat of nuclear war by ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). It was three years ago when the United States joined nations from around the world in signing a treaty banning nuclear explosives testing. It is up to the Senate to ratify this treaty and re-establish the United States as the world leader in efforts to stop nuclear proliferation. 
   Over forty years ago, President Dwight D. Eisenhower began an effort to end nuclear testing. During this time, the United States and five other nations conducted 2,046 nuclear test explosions--or an average of one nuclear test every nine days. The United States has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1992 when Congress and President Bush agreed to a moratorium on nuclear testing. 
   Countries who sign the CTBT agree to stop all above-ground and under-ground nuclear testing. The treaty also sets up an extensive system of monitors and on-site inspections to help ensure that countries adhere to the treaty. Finally, the treaty includes six ``safeguards'' proposed by the President; the most important of which, allows the United States to remove itself from the conditions of the treaty at any point the Congress and the President determine it would be in the Nation's interest to resume nuclear testing. The current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, numerous former military leaders, and an equal number of acclaimed nuclear scientists and nobel laureates support ratification of the CTBT. 
   My support for the CTBT comes with an understanding of the limitations associated with stopping countries and rogue nations from developing, testing, and deploying nuclear weapons. Opponents of the CTBT claim that it is not a perfect document and therefore threatens the security of our Nation. While I agree that the CTBT is not the definitive answer in stopping nuclear proliferation, I contend that it is an important step in the ongoing process to prevent nuclear war in the future. 
   The CTBT will not threaten our national security. Most importantly, the treaty bans the ``bang'', not the ``bomb.'' The United States already possesses the largest and most advanced nuclear weapons stockpile in the world. I agree that maintaining a strong nuclear deterrent is in our country's national security interest. Data collected from over 40 years of nuclear testing, coupled with advanced scientific computing will ensure the reliability and safety of our nuclear weapons without testing. As I mentioned before, the United States can also withdraw from the CTBT at any time to conduct whatever testing our country feels is necessary. 
   In fact, the CTBT will enhance our national security. The CTBT will limit the ability of other countries to acquire nuclear capabilities, and it will  severely constrain the programs of countries that currently have nuclear weapons. With or without the CTBT, the United States has a critical national security requirement to monitor global testing activities. Verification requirements built into the CTBT will provide our country with access to additional monitoring stations we would not otherwise have. For example, the CTBT requires the installation of over 30 monitoring stations in Russia, 11 in China, and 17 in the Middle East. These are in addition to the on-site inspections of nuclear facilities that are also allowed under the treaty. 
   Additional monitoring stations and on-site inspections are only effective if the countries we are most concerned with actually ratify the treaty. Granted, there is no guarantee that the United States' ratification of the CTBT will automatically mean that India, Pakistan, China, and Russia will follow suit. However, it is an even greater chance that these countries will be less inclined to ratify the treaty if our country does not take the lead. For those who doubt the likelihood of other countries ratifying the CTBT, I point to the example of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). It can not be refuted that the United States ratification of the CWC facilitated ratification by Russia, China, Pakistan, and Iran. Ratification by the United States is required to bring the CTBT into force, and ratification by the United States will strengthen our diplomatic efforts to influence other states to sign and ratify the treaty. 
   The CTBT will not rid the world of nuclear weapons and it may not even prevent all nations from conducting some kind of nuclear tests. However, the CTBT provides the best tool available for the United States to continue its efforts to combat nuclear proliferation without jeopardizing our own national security. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this important treaty and restoring America's leadership on this issue.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Health Care Act introduced today that works to correct the inequities of Medicare reforms included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
   I commend Senator DASCHLE for his tremendous efforts on this issue and for his leadership with the introduction of this bill. As well, I congratulate a number of my other colleagues who have contributed immensely to the crafting of this critical piece of legislation, including Senators MOYNIHAN, KENNEDY, ROCKEFELLER, BAUCUS, CONRAD, and others. 
   As part of the effort to balance the Federal budget, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) provided for major reforms in the way Medicare pays for medical services. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) included numerous cuts in Medicare payments to health care providers. These changes were originally expected to cut Medicare spending by about $115 over five years, but recent CBO projections show spending falling nearly twice that much. In the face of these deep cuts, health care providers are struggling, and beneficiary access to care is threatened. The Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act is a targeted solution to certain specific problems that the Balanced Budget Act has created. 
   As implementation of these reforms proceeds, health care providers and patient advocacy groups have asserted that some of the reforms are having--or are likely to have--undesirable or unintended consequences. Areas in patient care such as rehabilitative therapy, skilled nursing facilities, home health services, and hospital outpatient services have already begun to feel the effects of the reforms set forth in 1997. 
   Not surprising, I have heard from many safety net providers in South Dakota about the devastating effects such reductions in reimbursements are having throughout the health care industry. Consumers are also feeling the pain, as many individuals are being turned away from hospitals and nursing homes who cannot afford to accept new patients because of the lower reimbursement rates included in the Balanced Budget Act. These cuts are devastating and feared to have severe implications on the quality and access of health care throughout our nation, including South Dakota, unless Congress acts immediately to correct these problems. In South Dakota, and other rural parts of the country, hospitals and other health care providers have an extremely high percentage of Medicare beneficiaries making these cuts in reimbursement even more devastating. If Congress does not act in a timely fashion many of these providers may be forced to close their doors. 
   I look forward to continue working with my colleagues on passage of the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Health Care Act which develops creative, cost-effective approaches to address the unintended, long-term consequences of the BBA. The proposed budget surplus provides Congress the unique opportunity to address many of the deficiencies in our nation's health care system. We need to address the valid concerns of teaching hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health providers, rural and community hospitals, and other health care providers who require relief from the consequences of the BBA.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, first I will speak in response to what I regard as the commonsense statesmanship demonstrated on the part of the President with his veto of the Republican tax bill. There is an acknowledgment that there is around $1 trillion that could come into the Treasury over the next 10 years, over and above that required for Social Security. 
   It was wise on the President's part to say, first of all, we ought to be very prudent about whether that trillion dollars will actually materialize or not. It is based on assumptions that may or may not come true. If they do come true, we should prolong the life of Medicare and pay down existing debt. 
   Everywhere I go in South Dakota people of both political stripes tell me: Pay down the debt, keep interest rates down, make our economy grow, and if you still have dollars left, make key investments in education, in economic development, child care and health care, and then if there are some resources remaining, do give some tax relief. 
   The President has submitted a request for $250 million targeted to middle-class and working families, the families that need it most. I believe that veto is a wise move. We ought to go on to a negotiated end to this budget dilemma that will be bipartisan in nature and will be much more deliberative, much more thoughtful, and much wiser about how to use $1 trillion that may or may not materialize.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, the second issue I want to talk about this afternoon is the issue of prescription drug costs. I am going to have to edit my remarks due to time constraints more than I really prefer, but I do want to talk about the prescription drug costs we face in this Nation. 
   American seniors 65 or older make up only 12 percent of our population but consume, understandably, 35 percent of all prescription drugs. Studies have  shown that the average senior citizen takes more than 4 prescription drugs per day and fills an average of 18 per year. Costs have skyrocketed in recent years, increasing an estimated 17 percent last year alone. 
   What impact has this drug price increase had on senior citizens? It has been catastrophic for all too many. A survey completed in 1993 reported that 13 percent of older Americans say they literally are choosing between buying food or their prescription drugs. 
   Sadly, I hear the same story everywhere I go in my home State. Thirty-five percent of the Medicare population, equivalent to 13 million people, have no prescription drug benefits of any kind under any kind of insurance plan. Seniors sometimes fail to realize that the Medicare program itself contains no prescription drug benefit. 
   I recently requested a South Dakota study of prescription drug prices for seniors in our State, a study that I asked the Government Reform and Oversight Committee of the other body to conduct, comparing the prices our seniors pay compared to favored customers such as HMOs, the Federal Government, and large insurance companies.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, the results of the South Dakota study are consistent with studies in other States finding that seniors in South Dakota pay inflated prices for commonly used drugs. In fact, seniors are paying twice the amount per prescription compared to the price the pharmaceutical companies sell their drugs to their favored customers. In fact, we found some individual prescriptions where the price differential was as high as 1,469 percent for the same drug. These price differentials are far higher for prescription drugs than for any other consumer good. 
   The average price differential for the five top selling prescription drugs for seniors is 121 percent, while the price differential for other items considered daily essentials for the consumer is only 22 percent. 
   The study also indicates that pharmaceutical manufacturers--not the drugstores, not the pharmacies--appear to be responsible for this huge differential. South Dakota pharmacies have relatively small mark-ups, between the prices at which they buy the drugs and the prices at which they sell them. 
   The question is, Where do we go from here? There is talk about a Medicare add-on for prescription drugs. I hope we can go down that road. Quite frankly, a bipartisan agreement about how to pay for it and administer it simply has not been reached. In the interim, there are alternatives. 
   The Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of 1999, which I have sponsored with Senator KENNEDY, will provide a mandate--without the use of tax dollars, or any new Federal bureaucracy--that the pharmaceutical industry sell prescription drugs at the same price to Medicare beneficiaries as they sell to their favored customers. No more discrimination. If the Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act was enacted, we could reduce the cost of prescription drugs available to seniors by approximately 40 percent. There would be no bureaucracy, no tax dollars, and a huge benefit for seniors all over America. Our pharmacists would use the existing pharmaceutical distribution system and not create any new bureaucracy. 
   It is estimated that we will reduce drug prices for seniors by approximately 40 percent. There will be no more devastating choices among groceries, rent, and prescription drug costs. 
   I am pleased our bill is gaining endorsement and currently has the support of 10 of our colleagues, including Senators DASCHLE, DODD, DORGAN, FEINGOLD, HOLLINGS, INOUYE, LEAHY, KERRY, WELLSTONE, and BINGAMAN. Earlier this year, Representatives TOM ALLEN, JIM TURNER, MARION BERRY, and HENRY WAXMAN were joined by 61 of their colleagues when they introduced the House version of this bill, H.R. 664. They have now over 120 cosponsors. 
   Several organizations endorsed our legislation, some of which include the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, TREA Senior Citizens League, Consumer Federation of America, and Families USA Foundation. Many South Dakota groups have also endorsed our bill, including the South Dakota Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities and the North Central Chapter of the Paralyzed Veterans of America. We now have well over 30 organizations actively supporting this legislation. 
   Currently, there are several prescription drug proposals in Congress. We ought to have hearings on this issue, and we ought to go forward as aggressively as we can. 
   Madam President, there is no need to wait. We can act on this now. We can give seniors now the benefit of this 40 percent reduction in prescription drug costs that they deserve and need. 
   What an irony it is that so many of our seniors wind up not taking their prescription drugs in order to save money and then fall ill with an acute illness and wind up in the emergency room, and then Medicare picks up the tab. Wouldn't it be better if we can find a way to make sure seniors can afford the prescription in the first place to avoid that kind of acute illness, that emergency room visit? The taxpayers will gain, the dignity of the seniors will gain, their physical health will gain. All Americans would be better off with the immediate passage in this Congress of the Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of 1999. 
   I yield back such time as may remain. 
   Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the state of the Union is strong. Our country's overall economy is at an all time high, unemployment is at the lowest it has been in years, education is rising, and American homeownership is increasing. Despite all of these factors, our nation--and rural America in particular--is in the midst of an affordable housing shortage crisis. According to reports, 5.3 million Americans pay more than 50 percent in their annual income to rent or living in substandard conditions. This is unacceptable for a society as wealthy as ours, and we must make real progress now to improve housing conditions for all Americans. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss two critically important housing assistance programs that are cut by the short-sighted funding levels in the fiscal year 2000 (FY2000) VA-HUD Appropriations bill. 
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides Section 8 rental assistance to nearly three million families through Housing Certificate Funds, including vouchers, certificates, and project-based assistance. The VA-HUD Appropriations bill that we are discussing today provides $11 billion for the Housing Certificate Fund--which is $724 million more than the FY1999 level. While I am pleased that the VA-HUD bill ensures funding for all expiring Section 8 contracts for FY2000, I am deeply disappointed that the bill does not attempt to meet the future need for housing assistance by including funding for an additional 100,000 vouchers. 
   In my state of South Dakota, families in need of housing assistance spend an average of 9 months on a waiting list for current Section 8 vouchers. Sadly, this is actually a better situation than most Americans face. More than 1 million Americans wait an average of 28 months, or over two full years, for Section 8 assistance. 
   The strong economy in South Dakota has contributed to a shortage of affordable housing in our larger cities. In many of our smaller towns, adequate housing is also at a premium. An additional 100,000 Section 8 vouchers would mean that an additional 321 South Dakota families would receive Section 8 assistance. I urge my colleagues to adequately fund the proposal for 100,000 new Section 8 vouchers because the Section 8 program, simply put, helps families find housing they can afford. 
   Another housing program that has been extremely valuable for South Dakota and the nation is the Community Builder program. Community Builders have enabled HUD to take a much-needed customer-friendly approach to serving low-income Americans. In South Dakota, Community Builders are working with local governments and housing authorities to provide needed rental assistance statewide. 
   Community Builders have also worked with the Northeastern Council of Governments in South Dakota to spread information to several northeastern counties on the services that HUD provides, and how to access these services. Community Builders have facilitated FHA loans for the construction of affordable homes in Rapid City, while also helping the Sioux Empire Housing Partnership become a HUD- approved housing counseling agency. The Community Builder program has begun to address the housing needs in historically underserved communities, many of which have never utilized HUD services in the past. One of my former staffers, Stephanie Helfrich, was a Community Builder Specialist for the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, and her work has enabled tribal leaders to better utilize HUD's programs to the benefit of one of the most poor populations in the nation. 
   In conclusion, I understand the strict budget constraints the committee faces in drafting this bill. While I support every effort to keep government spending low, I believe it is a wise investment in our country's future when we ensure that our working families have adequate housing. I will continue to work with my colleagues to find ways to help South Dakota families and families across the nation address their housing needs.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to have joined my colleague Mr. WELLSTONE from Minnesota in offering an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2000 VA-HUD Appropriations bill to increase funding for veterans health care by an additional $1.3 billion. This would create a $3 billion increase in VA health care funding --the level called for by the Independent Budget produced by a coalition of veterans organizations. 
   Before I begin, I would like to take a minute and make a few comments on the amendment that the Senate already has accepted. First, I want to thank Senators BOND and MIKULSKI for offering the amendment to add an additional $600 million for veterans' health care. By accepting this amendment, the total increase for veterans' health care in this piece of legislation is now $1.7 billion. I am pleased that my colleagues recognize the dire situation facing the Veterans Administration and our nation's veterans because of past negligence in meeting the needs of veterans health care. 
   I supported the amendment, and I have asked to be added as a cosponsor. However, as I understand it, this $1.7 billion will provide only momentary relief to a VA system which has been drastically underfunded for the past three years. That is why Senator WELLSTONE and I offered an amendment to give even more to veterans, who in service of their country gave everything they had to protect this democracy. 
   Mr. President, let me begin by saying that this is the fourth consecutive year, that the Clinton Administration has proposed a flat-line appropriation for veterans' health care in its FY 2000 budget request. The VA's budget included a $17.3 billion appropriation request for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Although, the Clinton Administration's request included allowing the VA to collect approximately $749 million from third-party insurers--$124 million more than in FY 1999, this cap on medical spending places a greater strain on the quality of patient care currently provided in our nation's VA facility, especially when meeting the needs and high health costs of our rapidly aging World War II population. 
   Our nation's veterans groups have worked extensively on crafting a sensible budget that will allow the VA to provide the necessary care to all veterans. They have offered an Independent Budget that calls for an immediate $3 billion increase for VA health care to rectify two current deficiencies in the VA budget. First, the VA has had to reduce expenditures by $1.3 billion due to their flatlined budget at $17.3 billion. These were mandatory reductions in outpatient and inpatient care and VA staff levels that the VA had to make due to their flatlined budget. 
   The remaining $1.7 billion is needed to keep up with medical inflation, COLAs for VA employees, new medical initiatives that the VA wants to begin (Hepatitis C screenings, emergency care services), long term health care costs, funding for homeless veterans, and treating 54,000 new patients in 89 outpatient clinics. 
   Although we have increased veterans' health care by a total of $1.7 billion, and which certainly will help relieve some of the VA's budgetary constraints, I believe that more needs to be done. The veterans community has requested that VA health care needs to be augmented by $3 billion to ensure the provision of accessible and high quality services to veterans. 
   That is why Senator WELLSTONE and I offered an amendment, and which I remind my colleagues the Senate unanimously accepted 99-0, during consideration of the budget resolution that raised VA health care to a total of $3 billion. The nation's top veterans groups (AMVETS, Blinded Veterans Association, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars and Vietnam Veterans of America) voiced their strong support for our amendment, however, the final budget resolution contained an increase of only $1.7 billion. 
   I agree with the coalition of veterans organizations that have put together a sensible and responsible alternative VA budget'' that an infusion of approximately $3 billion into the VA health budget is needed this year in order to avoid an unconscionable destruction of our nation's commitment to its veterans. Without such a funding boost, framed within a balanced federal budget, we will soon be witnessing enormous VA staffing reductions, degradation of VA health care quality, the termination of needed programs, and the closure of VA hospitals. Our hopes of establishing VA outreach clinics in such communities as Aberdeen, South Dakota will be impossible without an increase in funding. 
   That is why Senator WELLSTONE and I are offering this amendment. The veterans community has done all the research and is acutely aware of the glaring health care needs that the VA must contend with in order to care for our nation's veterans. Our amendment would take $1.3 billion from the non-Social Security surplus and designate it as emergency spending for veterans' health care. The funding required for this amendment represents a minute fraction of the total federal budget that we are debating here today. However, the funding we set aside to improve accessibility and quality of care within our veterans health care system will provide a tremendous boost for an already stretched and fractured VA medical system. 
   Mr. President, since I began my service in Congress over twelve years ago,  I have held countless meetings, marched in small town Memorial Day parades, and participated in Veterans Day tributes with South Dakota's veterans. As the years go on their concerns remain the same. To ensure that Congress provides the VA with adequate funding to meet the health care needs for all veterans. Without additional funding South Dakota VA facilities will continue to face staff reductions, cutbacks in programs, and possible closing of facilities. 
   Too often, I have received letters from veterans who must wait up to three months to see a doctor. For many veterans who do not have any other form of health insurance, the VA is the only place they can go to receive medical attention. They were promised medical care when they completed their service and now many veterans are having to jump through hoops just to see a doctor. 
   It is time for Congress to end this neglect and fiscal irresponsibility when it comes to providing decent health care for veterans. I think Senator WELLSTONE would agree with me that no one in this body would accept three years of flat-lined budgets if we were talking about the Department of Defense or national security funding. But that is exactly what we've done to our veterans. Every year we labor through the appropriations process and every year veterans funding is treated as an afterthought and not one of our first priorities. 
   As Congress makes spending decisions for fiscal year 2000, we also will have to decide what to do with the non-Social Security surplus for next year. Shouldn't we be able to use some of that surplus to address the immediate problems of veterans health care? I think our veterans deserve nothing less, and we should make a committed effort to give the VA all the resources it needs to operate effectively. 
   I want to thank my friend, Mr. WELLSTONE, for working with me on this endeavor to do what we feel is our obligation to our veterans. The veterans community is fortunate to have such a vigilant advocate in Senator WELLSTONE who has displayed tremendous passion and leadership when it comes to ensuring that our nation's commitment to our veterans is not forgotten. 
   As we enter the twilight of the Twentieth Century, we can look back at the immense multitude of achievements that led to the ascension of the United States of America as the preeminent nation in modern history. We owe this title as world's greatest superpower in large part to the twenty-five million men and women who served in our armed services and who defended the principles and ideals of our nation. 
   From the battlefields of Lexington and Concord, to the beaches of Normandy, and to the deserts of the Persian Gulf, our nation's history is replete with men and women who, during the savagery of battle, were willing to forego their own survival not only to protect the lives of their comrades, but because they believed that peace and freedom was too invaluable a right to be vanquished. Americans should never forget our veterans who served our nation with such dedication and patriotism. 
   Again, Mr. President, I applaud Chairman BOND and Senator MIKULSKI for recognizing the shortcomings in this VA-HUD Appropriations bill by increasing veterans' health care by an additional $1.7 billion. Senator WELLSTONE and I believe that we can go even further, and we ask for the Senate's support. We have an obligation to provide decent, affordable, health care for America's veterans. We should live up to our obligation to our nation's veterans and ensure that they are treated with the respect and honor that they so richly deserve.

<DOCNO>106-johnson-sd-2-19990922</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JOHNSON. Yes. 
   Let me say first, while I am very grateful for the effort that our colleague from West Virginia and our colleague from Missouri have undertaken to try to better fund the VA budget, I commend my colleague from Minnesota, Senator WELLSTONE, for clarifying and making it very clear that in fact while the budget picture is difficult--we know that--at the same time, if we were to fully fund everything that really ought to be done, it would require a $3 billion infusion, given the 3 years of flatline budget that the VA health care budget is already suffering through. 
   Certainly, I applaud the effort to bring the VA health care budget up $1.7 billion instead of $1.1 billion. I think that is a very positive thing. But it does concern me that when we talked about the full $3 billion increase, we were talking then about the opportunity, as I understand it--if the Senator agrees with me--that that would have been sufficient then to fund the hepatitis C screenings, emergency care services, and 54,000 new patients in 89 outpatient clinics around America. This is the kind of agenda we would have been able to proceed with if we had been able to secure the full $3 billion instead of $1.1 billion--or certainly $1.7 billion. 
   So I applaud again my friend, Senator WELLSTONE, recognizing we worked together on the budget resolution earlier this year to secure House agreement with a $3 billion increase. And we have been fighting ever since to try to hold the number as high as we can get it, recognizing that when it comes to veterans' health care, would the Senator agree with me, this ought to be the kind of budget priority that comes at the head of the line 
   rather than one that we fund with whatever is left over after everything else has been concluded. 
   In fact, these are the individuals who put their lives on the line, who disrupted their families, who did their duty, who gave their service to our Nation and made it possible for our liberty to be protected, for our democracy to be preserved. Yet, too often, when it comes to living up to the obligations that our Government has made to the health care of our veterans and their families, we cry poverty when in fact virtually everything else in the budget has already been taken care of. 
   It would seem to me that we do have a need to continue to put veterans' health care concerns among our very first priorities--in fact, right up there with our national security funding itself. I think that veterans' health care funding--if the Senator would agree with me--is part and parcel of our national defense strategy--at least it ought to be regarded in that respect--because it is part of what keeps so many of our best and brightest young people interested in a military service career at a time when we have too many people leaving the military, where we have retention problems. 
   It would seem to me that one of the reasons we have that problem is, we have too often reneged on and neglected our obligations on such fundamental things as veterans' health care and veterans' benefits in the past. 
   So again, I appreciate the effort to try to raise the visibility of our obligations to our veterans and to secure the best possible funding we can possibly get out of this conference report.

   Mr. JOHNSON. I thank my friend from New Jersey. 
   Our Nation deserves a thoughtful tax and budget plan from Congress that places an emphasis on paying down our existing accumulated national debt, while protecting Social Security and Medicare, and investing in key domestic priorities and providing targeted tax relief for middle-class and working families. 
   On the marriage penalty, for instance, most families in America get a marriage tax bonus, not a penalty. But for those who are penalized, we can address that in the Democratic plan while approaching this in a balanced fashion. But, sadly, the radical tax cut bill being considered by congressional Republicans could be described as simply ``foolish,'' were it not so seriously dangerous to the future prosperity and security of every American family. 
   There are obvious reasons why even leading Republican economists so vigorously are condemning this irresponsible bill, and why it has become the butt of so much ridicule. 
   First, the bill assumes that a $964 billion surplus over that needed for Social Security will absolutely materialize over the coming decades while our budget estimators in the past haven't even been able to estimate the economic growth over a year much less over 10 years. Common sense tells us that we should be careful about committing to use money that we do not yet have and may never have. 
   Second, this plan fails to use even a cent of the supposed $1 trillion surplus above Social Security to help pay down the $3.7 trillion public debt that our Nation currently owes. Paying down our debts would do more to keep the American economy growing than any other single thing the Government could do. 
   Third, in order to find room for a $792 billion tax cut, we would have to not only pay down the accumulated debt but we would have to cut defense buying power by 17 percent and domestic programs, meaning law enforcement, VA, health, education, school construction, medical research, national parks, and so on by 23 percent over the coming 10 years. If we decline to cut defense, under this plan we then would have to 
   cut these domestic initiatives by an outrageous 38 percent. What is even worse is that this tax bill is cynically constructed so that the drain on the Treasury will explode and triple in cost during the second decade after passage. 
   Fourth, economic experts all over the country tell us that this tax package would cause interest rates to go up. At the current time, the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and warning us that putting one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake is not a sensible economic policy for our country. 
   The small tax cut that most Americans would receive would be negated through higher costs for financing everything from a house, to a car, to college education, to business expansion, and farming and ranching operations. If this bill becomes law, our middle-class families will wind up with fewer and not more dollars in their pockets. 
   Fifth, this bill does absolutely nothing to prolong the life of Medicare much less provide for drug coverage payment reform that hospitals and clinics and medical institutions all over our country are in dire need of securing. 
   Specifically, this legislation outrageously provides an average $22,500 tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. But a typical American family--a family in my State of South Dakota with an income of $38,000--would get a couple of bucks a week while paying higher interest costs for everything they buy. 
   Wouldn't it make more sense to use a large portion of any surplus that actually materializes to pay down the accumulated national debt and then provide for targeted tax relief for middle-class and working families, protect Social Security and Medicare, and make some key investments in education, in the environment, infrastructure, and the things that we need to continue the economic growth in America? 
   I yield the remainder of time that I may have to my colleague from New Jersey, Senator LAUTENBERG.

    Mr. JOHNSON. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, the 401(k) Right To Know Act, to require that 401(k) plan providers implement procedures to disclose the administrative fees that they charge their customers. However, I hope the need for the legislation can be effectively eliminated by voluntary action on the part of the plan providers to disclose fees. 
   I am concerned that millions of American families work and save for their retirement through 401(k) plans without having an opportunity to fully evaluate and compare the costs of such plans. National news publications have suggested that some plans may be charging plan participants up to 2.5% of assets annually to manage their accounts. While I believe families should be free to choose among competing plans and to participate in retirement savings vehicles of their choice, I am troubled that information about fees is not fully disclosed. 
   I believe that we have an obligation to make sure that families have access to basic information about fees. Congress encourages people to participate in 401(k) retirement plans by providing considerable tax advantages. We should give equal care to making sure that  businesses and families have the information necessary to protect their nest eggs from excessive, undisclosed fees that threaten to siphon off the rewards of their work and prudence. 
   Recently the Department of Labor, the American Bankers Association, the American Council of Life Insurance, and the Investment Company Institute announced a plan to address these concerns and provide information about 401(k) fees. I applaud this responsible and important effort. The agreements reached should be given fair consideration and an opportunity to be implemented. It is my sincere hope, that these efforts will be supported by all 401(k) plan providers and that consumers will utilize and benefit from fee disclosure. 
   Nonetheless, I want to go on record to articulate my lingering concern for the lack of disclosure currently provided and make known my conviction to pursue legislative action should the industry fail to fully implement the goals of disclosure recently agreed upon. Again, I want to reiterate that I believe the recent announcement is an important step to resolve this issue. My goal is to make sure consumers have accurate and timely information about fees readily available to them. I will be monitoring the progress closely and remain hopeful that legislative action will not be necessary to achieve disclosure of 401(k) fees.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada. I associate myself with the remarks of my friend and colleague from Iowa, Senator HARKIN, on this issue. 
   Today the Senate is considering the reinstatement of rule XVI, the Senate rule preventing authorizing legislation from being included on appropriations bills. 
   The reason the Senate is forced today to consider the reinstatement of rule XVI is because the Republican majority overturned the ruling of the Chair in 1995. Prior to 1995, it always was the rule that no authorizing language could be added to an appropriations bill. 
   Having had several years of experience under this new regime, the majority comes back with a proposal now to go back to that old rule, whereby authorizing language way not be added to an appropriations bill. If debate were being brought forward on the floor of the Senate in the way that it had over most of the history of this institution, I do not think there would be very much resistance to going back to rule XVI. 
   But what needs to be pointed out is the context we find ourselves in post-1995, the way in which, frankly, the current majority party seems to be bringing legislation to the floor, and the fact that this process has changed radically, and for the worse, not only for the minority party but for the American people. 
   If debate on amendments were brought forward in a fair fashion, with the majority party and the minority party being allowed to bring amendments and legislation to the floor, to have a reasonable discussion of those issues--whether it be about HMO managed care reform, whether it be about campaign finance reform, whether it be about minimum wage, whether it be about farm disaster legislation--regardless of what it might be, I do not think there would be any opposition to bringing those amendments up outside the context of an appropriations bill. 
   In recent years, it has become common practice, in fact the usual practice, for authorizing legislation, when it is brought to the floor of the Senate, to be brought with what amounts to a gag order on the minority party. By a gag order, I mean legislation is frequently now brought to the floor by our majority leader with the amendment tree filled, meaning that no minority amendments are permitted whatsoever to authorizing legislation, allowing for no additional amendments to be offered. Then cloture is filed before there is any debate on anything relative to the amendments the minority party ordinarily is allowed to bring. 
   What does the majority fear? Why is there this concern? Is it really a matter of saving time? As my colleague from Iowa has noted, we go days at a time around this place with no constructive legislative progress being made on the floor of the Senate, with a quorum call in progress, with no one here. Is it really to save time or is it, in fact, a concern on the part of the majority that the American people should not be allowed to share the discussion and debate on the floor about key issues that ought to be before the American public, about where this country ought to be going relative to its domestic and international agendas. Is there a gag rule for some reason other than saving time? One would have to conclude that, yes, that is the case; that apparently the majority finds it embarrassing to have Members of this body discussing an agenda that is not being addressed by the Senate. 
   All of this really amounts to the minority party being shut out of the process, being denied the right to amend legislation when that legislation comes to the floor. 
   An example, Mr. President, is when legislation to create a so-called lockbox for the Social Security trust fund was brought to the floor on several occasions earlier this year. Grossly inadequate lockbox legislation was being brought to the floor. It belied what most people would think of when they think of a lockbox. But there was no opportunity for amendments to be offered or even considered. 
   The minority party understands it is the minority party. It may lose a vote on a proposed amendment. But that party ought to be allowed the opportunity to point out the deficiencies of legislation and to have a fair up-or-down vote. There are times when Democrats will vote with Republicans, and Republicans will vote with Democrats. That is the way the process ought to work. Yet that opportunity is being denied this body. 
   The question for all of us to consider, again, is, What is the majority afraid of? Do they not believe Senators in the minority have the right to offer amendments, or that any Senator in the majority might from time to time vote with the minority? It is a sad commentary about the bipartisan politics of this body if that, indeed, is the case. 
   I had the honor of serving in the other Chamber for a number of years. Over there, where they have 435 Representatives, there is a Rules Committee that decides which amendments will be considered and when, and how that legislation is brought to the floor. In the other body, that process is sometimes abused but probably is necessary, given the sheer size of the body. The possibility of 435 Members offering multiple amendments obviously boggles the mind and could, indeed, slow down the process. 
   But one of the great strengths of the Senate has been, 
   because of our smaller size and the historic collegiality that has existed most of the time in this body, we don't have that kind of Rules Committee, that kind of power. Here we bring these issues to the floor for an open and fair and balanced debate; obviously, with the majority and the minority dividing the time and proceeding with debate in an orderly, constructive fashion but with an opportunity to address the key issues facing the Nation, whether brought by the majority or brought by the minority, to have that discussion. Unfortunately, the current majority--and this is out of precedent going back throughout the history of our country--wants to deny Senators in the minority a chance to offer the amendments they believe need to be offered.  
   I think there would be few Senators on the part of the minority who would object to reaching bipartisan agreements on the amount of time to be spent on particular legislation or the number of amendments to be offered. It is very common that these agreements about numbers of amendments and time agreements are reached in a bipartisan fashion so that we can continue to proceed in an orderly fashion so that there is no real risk of debate on these issues somehow clogging up the process and denying the ability of the Senate to move forward with its agenda. This is not a tradeoff between orderly development of legislative issues and the opportunity for the minority to bring up amendments and discuss them in a reasonable manner. 
   I think it is important for everyone who is following this debate, then, to keep these circumstances in mind, to fully understand what the restoration of rule XVI really is all about. It is not about orderly progress of legislation. It is not about saving time. It is about trying to gag the minority party with no opportunity to bring up legislation which the majority party is ignoring. It is a means of preventing the minority party from pointing out the deficiencies and inadequacies, as they see it, of legislation being offered by the majority. It is the majority party's effort to see to it that their own Members don't cross the aisle to vote with the minority party on selected pieces of legislation and to save themselves from that apparent embarrassment. 
   I point out another important issue that must be discussed again in this context. That is Senator DASCHLE's amendment to reinstate the scope of conference point of order.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Prior to 1996, a point of order could be brought in conference committee against an amendment that had not been offered and debated in either the House or the Senate but was included in one of their versions of the bill. The majority is also overturning that rule, meaning they have the opportunity, then, to deny minority amendments on the floor of the Senate, but then, when they are in conference committee behind closed doors, with no media, no press, the majority party can amend legislation any way they wish, without regard to action of the House or the Senate on the floor. 
   I hope in the context of all of this the Senate will remain consistent with precedent in supporting Senator DASCHLE's effort to make sure there is some continuity of action in those conference committees. This is particularly important in light of the changes being proposed on rule XVI. 
   I yield back such time as I have to the Senator from Nevada.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on the floor of the other body today and coming to the floor of the Senate this coming week is going to be legislation having to do with taxation, having to do with tax cuts. Just when we think we have seen just about everything in terms of irresponsibility and foolishness, we see something literally taking the cake. We are seeing some pandering irresponsibility of record proportions that would be so serious and so injurious to this Nation's economic future and to the priorities of this country that we simply have to begin to speak about this issue today. 
   What does this issue revolve around? It revolves around the Congressional Budget Office's projections that we will have about a $964 billion budget surplus over the coming 10 years, over and above what is needed for Social Security. Those are projections 10 years out, incredibly tenuous given the fact that in the past we haven't been able to make projections for a year out that have been accurate, much less for 10 years. But nonetheless, that is the baseline for this debate. 
   Given the economic prosperity this administration has brought us, particularly the 1993 Budget Act, passed without a single Republican vote in either body, we do have a unique opportunity now to do some extraordinary things for ourselves and for the coming generation of Americans in terms of eliminating the accumulated Federal debt, make some key investments and, yes, assisting with some targeted tax relief to those families who need it most. 
   But what do we see coming to us from the other body? What do we see coming on this floor this coming week? We see a tax plan from our Republican majority friends suggesting that with this $964 billion, if you even believe it is going to happen, first of all, nothing be set aside for the preservation and the strengthening of Medicare, nothing. 
   Second, in order to give essentially this entire amount of money back as  tax relief--primarily to the most wealthy people who are making the political contributions in this body; the typical American family gets about a buck a week tax relief--we will have to then reduce over the coming 10 years defense spending buying power by about 17 percent, at a time when we are having a hard time trying to figure out how to maintain our security responsibilities around the world as it is. This tax package would assume, then, that we will have a 23-percent reduction in domestic spending buying power over the coming 10 years. 
   If you buy into this tax package, that means you close veterans hospitals. That means you have significant reductions in Head Start programs, education programs. That means you give up on the idea we will have some sort of partnership for rebuilding our schools and bringing new technology into our schools. It means gutting education and agricultural programs. It means severe cuts in parks, law enforcement, in medical research, all the things most Americans think are crucial to our Federal, State and local, public and private partnerships that make this the great country it is. 
   On top of that, if you think that is not bad enough, there is zero set aside for the reduction of the accumulated Federal national debt we have accumulated over the 200-year history of this country but which primarily came about during the 1980s, during the Reagan and Bush years and now stands at $5.6 trillion. It does nothing to buy down that existing debt. 
   And if the decision is made down the road we are not going to knock defense spending down by 17 percent, then the consequence of that, under this plan, would be that we would have to reduce domestic spending--Head Start, education, parks, law enforcement, medical research, VA hospitals, agriculture, all that range of initiatives, by 38 percent. 
   This is a radical, extremist agenda for the Nation. The American people deserve better than this. 
   Just when you think that is as bad as things can get, you look at the way this tax package is constructed, with the tax reductions, especially back loaded for the very wealthy, and then what do you find on the next page? Not only have you given up your entire domestic agenda, not only have you done nothing to reduce the accumulated Federal deficit, not only have you done nothing for Medicare, but the cost of this recipe explodes to double the cost in the next 10 years. What a radical agenda. It would be foolish, were it not so serious and so injurious to our Nation. 
   Then one last thought: The Federal Reserve has recently raised interest rates by about a quarter percent. Some are attempting in this tax package to put one foot on the gas while the other foot is on the brake. If we were to do this, the obvious next consequence would be a significant increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. There is already a rise in interest rates now, without any tax cut whatever. That is a silent tax on every American. 
   On every parent who wants to send a child to college or a vocational school, and on everyone who wants to buy a house, or buy a car, or a farmer who wants to finance his operation, or a businessperson who wants to expand his business and create new jobs, that is a killing tax. It is a higher interest rate as a consequence of this incredible irresponsibility that we see going on in the House today and coming to the Senate this coming week. 
   Thank goodness for the future of America President Clinton has indicated he will veto this nonsense. But wouldn't it be better if we could work together in a bipartisan fashion on a constructive, positive agenda that, yes, would provide some tax relief to working class people, working families, the families who struggle to make a car payment, a house payment, and to keep jeans and tennis shoes on the kids, the people who make the economy go. Let's provide tax relief there, but let's pay down some of the national debt, which is probably the single-best thing we can do in any kind of budget plan. We should make sure we make key investments in education, in Head Start, in medical research, and keep the VA hospitals open. We can do all of these things with thoughtful balance and moderation. But moderation seems to be the last thing in the world our Republican friends want to bring to either the other body or this floor in terms of tax and budget agendas. 
   I think where you put your money says a great deal about the character of any government because rhetoric is cheap. Everybody is for everything around here, until it is time to put some money where your mouth is and do the balancing that needs to be done. That is what we see not happening on the other side. What we are seeing is pandering and irresponsibility and 
   radical agendas that may make a statement for the coming elections. Who knows? It seems to me it makes a very negative statement. 
   But we deserve better than that. This Nation deserves better, and this Nation needs better than that. We need to come up with a budget and tax reduction package that is moderate, thoughtful, and deals with some of the tax relief that is needed but makes investments that are needed and pays down the accumulated Federal debt. That will keep the cost of money down and make it easier to send a kid to college or vocational school, buy a house, buy a car, or keep a farming or ranching operation going, all of those things, if we make the right decisions. 
   But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Many of us thought, in the years we have had the opportunity to serve in Congress, several things would never happen in our lifetime: The fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the possibility that we would ever be on the floor arguing about what to do about budget surpluses. We have that opportunity. Let's not waste that opportunity. 
   Let's take a thoughtful, constructive, positive approach to how to use those dollars as we embark on this next millennium and revisit this tax package so we emerge from this debate with a package that, in fact, does address the priorities that I think the American people want us to address, and that does it, hopefully, in a bipartisan fashion and in a way that will leave our economy stronger and leave our families stronger going into the coming century than we are now and, certainly, far stronger than what would happen if we tragically actually passed and enacted the tax agenda that we see occurring on the House floor today and is coming to this body next week. 
   I yield back my time.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank Senator LANDRIEU for her leadership on this issue, as well as Chairman MURKOWSKI. 
   I think we have an enormous opportunity this year to at last reach a bipartisan agreement to increase significantly the funding for several critically important planned water and wildlife conservation programs. Several legislative efforts to establish mandatory funding for conservation programs utilizing Outer Continental Shelf, OCS, revenue are under bipartisan discussion. 
   I have been pleased to participate in hearings on these initiatives in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. All of the conservation legislation introduced this year proposed significant steps to support the restoration, preservation and conservation of our natural resources. The hearings in our committee have been extremely useful since, if we are to be successful this year, we have the daunting task ahead of us of drafting a compromise conservation bill which meets the diverse needs of all fifty states. Consequently, we need to hear as many perspectives and learn as much about the needs in the states as possible before we begin drafting a compromise bill. 
   Preserving our natural resources is an issue to which many of us in this body are committed. Earlier this year I joined 35 of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in sending a letter to Budget Committee Chairman DOMINICI and Senator LAUTENBERG requesting full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
   Further, during consideration of the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution, Senator BOXER and I offered an amendment to establish a conservation reserve fund. This amendment was unanimously approved by the Budget Committee, passed by the Senate but unfortunately dropped in the conference committee. Nonetheless, the strong support from the Senate for this concept signals a commitment to finding a way to fund additional conservation initiatives. 
   Additionally, one third of the Members of this body have cosponsored one of the conservation proposals which have been introduced. This level of interest indicates that while we have not come to an agreement on the details which should be included in a comprehensive conservation proposal, significant interest in this issue exists. This widespread interest offers an opportunity to find a bipartisan compromise to address this critically important issue. 
   I applaud Senator BOXER in particular for her efforts in this area, and I applaud Senators LANDRIEU and MURKOWSKI for their work on S. 25. 
   One of the primary reasons I supported the bill earlier this year is the sponsors' inclusion of the non-game wildlife initiative, often called Teaming With Wildlife (TWW). I am convinced that funding for specified nongame conservation programs must  be secured if we want to successfully work to keep species off of threatened and endangered species lists while also meeting the skyrocketing demand for outdoor recreation and education opportunities. 
   Currently, I am circulating a letter which I will be sending to Chairman MURKOWSKI and Senator LANDRIEU which advocates a higher percentage of funding for wildlife conservation than currently included in S. 25. Specifically, I am advocating increasing the funding allocation from 7 to 10. At this time other Senators joining me in sending the letter include: Senators CLELAND, FRIST, LINCOLN, DASCHLE, KERREY, GREGG, and BAYH--and more Senators may join in our effort. 
   I commend Chairman MURKOWSKI and Senator LANDRIEU for their support of the TWW concept and look forward to working with them to find an adequate level of funding for this important program. 
   There are other issues, of course, for which I have a great deal of interest, including the funding for the PILT program and funding for historic preservation efforts. 
   However, probably the largest outstanding issue--and the potential show stopper--for all of us who want to find a compromise conservation proposal is identifying whether we have room in the budget to increase funding for conservation. 
   The recent mid-session review paints a rosy picture of our current economic situation and I believe that targeted tax relief and paying down the publicly held debt must be our top priorities. However, I also believe that within the context of a balanced budget, the new economic projections give us room to consider modestly increasing funding for domestic priorities, such as conversation. 
   Again, we have an opportunity this year to find a bipartisan compromise which will ensure adequate funding for conservation, restoration, and preservation efforts across this country. I again commend Chairman MURKOWSKI and Senator LANDRIEU for their bipartisan effort and look forward to working with them in the coming weeks and month to craft a bill which can pass this body and 
   which will, in fact, be signed by the President of the United States. 
   I yield such time as I have remaining.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my appreciation of my colleagues for their overwhelming and bipartisan support for confirmation of Karen Schreier as a United States Federal District Judge for South Dakota. Karen Schreier has established an extraordinary reputation for skill and integrity during her years of private law practice, and as a very successful United States Attorney. 
   It is of historic note, that Karen is about to become the first female federal judge in South Dakota's 110-year history, and her outstanding achievements as an attorney, community leader, and federal judge will serve as a model for countless other talented young people throughout our state--both men and women. Most importantly, however, her ascension to the federal bench is a victory for justice and the rule of law. South Dakota and our nation will be very well served by Karen Schreier's tenure as Federal District Judge for South Dakota. 
   I also must observe that even the most talented of individuals does not achieve the highest career success without the support and assistance of other important people in their lives. I had the great honor and pleasure of serving in the South Dakota legislature with Karen's father, Harold Schreier. Harold represented the very best of public service in our state, and I know that Karen's success would be of enormous pride and satisfaction to him. Karen's mother, Maysie Schreier, has been a wonderful resource in the Flandreau community in her own right, and her values and determination are reflected in her daughter. Karen's husband, Tim Dougherty, is a talented lawyer, community leader and source of never-ending support and encouragement. Tim's father, Bill Dougherty, has for many years been one of South Dakota's foremost political leaders and voice for common-sense and progressive public policy. Bill has been the father of a great deal of legislative accomplishment in our state, but I have a feeling that Karen's success will always be one of his greatest sources of pride. 
   Mr. President, it is with wonderful personal satisfaction, that I can today offer my congratulations to Karen Schreier on her confirmation. Congratulations as well, to the Schreier and Dougherty families--outstanding South Dakota families, and valued personal friends!

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my warmest congratulations to Pioneer Memorial Hospital in Viborg, SD. 
   Pioneer Memorial Hospital is celebrating 40 years of dedicated service to the residents of Viborg and the surrounding area. It is an outstanding example of continued excellence in the delivery of health care services to rural South Dakota. 
   In an era when the high cost of medical care has driven a wedge between the patient and the provider, small, rural hospitals like Pioneer Memorial Hospital remind us of the true ethic of medical care; compassion, commitment and dedication to those in need. There is no reward great enough for the hard work and long hours that the staff at Pioneer Memorial Hospital have sacrificed on the behalf of others. They have brought into the world the newborn babies of friends and neighbors and cared for those who have lived long and noble lives. Perhaps most importantly, they should be recognized for the hand that they extended to those whom they did not know but reached out to in times of need. 
   Therefore, it is with great honor that I recognize Pioneer Memorial Hospital for its dedication to service and excellence in providing quality medical care to Viborg and the surrounding area. I applaud the efforts of every individual involved with the hospital throughout the years and offer my best wishes for another 40 years of service and excellence.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my warmest congratulations to the South Dakota State University Central Research Station in Highmore, SD. 
   Today the experiment station is celebrating one hundred years of dedicated service to the agriculture industry in the Northern Plains. It is an outstanding example of the continued application of technological advancements by our farmers and ranchers in an ever-changing competitive environment. 
   The Highmore Research Farm, also known as the Central Crops and Soils Research Station, was the first research farm created in the north-central United States. It was created in 1899 at the request of livestock producers who desired drought-resistant forage plants on the prairie. It was determined that a substation was to be established between the James and Missouri Rivers and a location was eventually secured near Highmore. Initially the work at the experiment station was centered around testing drought-resisting forage and devising ways and means for livestock producers to obtain winter forage as well. Later, crop production and rotation became an integral part of the research station. 
   Affiliated with South Dakota State University in Brookings, this experiment station has been a leader in providing and conducting state-of-the-art agriculture research. In Highmore and at the various other South Dakota Agricultural Experiment Stations across the state, researchers cover a variety of aspects of agriculture, ranging from crop to livestock production. Over 150 different projects demand the time and effort by these dedicated researchers at this time. Through sound science and a problem solving attitude these researchers expand the knowledge base for all of agriculture and those affected by it on a daily basis. 
   In this critical time in production agriculture while depressed crop and livestock prices are driving agriculture producers from their operations, it is all the more essential that we encourage the research taking place at the experiment stations. As we enter a new millennium we must develop ways for producers to afford and adapt to the technological advancements that can make United States agriculture more competitive. This is crucial in order for South Dakota to compete in the ever-changing global market. 
   The research and knowledge gained from these experiment stations benefit not only agriculture producers, but also consumers living in rural towns and urban cities. Learning from the past and building towards the future is a daily mission at the Highmore Experiment Station. I applaud the efforts of each researcher and all of those who dedicated their time and effort to this farm in the last 100 years. I extend my best wishes to the Central Research Station in Highmore for another 100 years of successful research and service to South Dakota agriculture.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support of S. 880, the Fuels Regulatory Relief Act. This bill will provide relief to hundreds of propane suppliers, farmers, and ranchers in my State of South Dakota. 
   The Fuels Regulatory Relief Act would exempt propane from being included under the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program, or RMP, rule. The RMP rule was crafted as a way to increase awareness among state and local governments and the public of hazardous chemicals in communities. The thinking behind this rule was that if chemical companies had to develop and make public information about a worst case scenario in the event of an accidental release, the companies would take steps to lower the possibility of such an accident. Also, the authors of this rule thought local emergency teams would be able to respond more quickly and efficiently to an accident at a hazardous chemical site if the teams knew in advance how much damage to expect. 
   I do not have any problems with the RMP rule in that respect. I think communities can benefit from knowing the potential for chemical accidents that could happen within their borders. I do, however, have deep concerns about the inclusion of substances that are not toxic but are flammable. The RMP rule was not created to regulate flammable substances, as demonstrated by the EPA's decision not to include gasoline under the rule. Yet propane is included under the rule, and people who have more than 16,000 pounds of propane on their property will have to submit an RMP. 
   Complying with this rule is a great burden on propane suppliers, farmers, and ranchers, as the cost per site may be as much as several thousand dollars.  I have been contacted by a number of propane suppliers in my State who have expressed their frustration with having to submit an RMP, and the American Farm Bureau has voiced its concerns about the effects of this rule on farmers who use propane for fuel purposes. Small business owners, farmers, and ranchers who possess and use large amounts of propane should not be forced to comply with a rule directed at curbing accidents involving hazardous chemicals, especially when flammable substances are subject to a number of other federal regulations. 
   For these reasons, I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 880, the Fuels Regulatory Relief Act. I believe that exempting propane from inclusion under the RMP rule is consistent with the purpose of the rule, as it does not change the way hazardous and toxic chemicals are regulated. The Fuels Regulatory Relief Act will save propane users and suppliers in my State thousands of dollars in compliance costs, and I urge my colleagues to support its expeditious passage.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to KELO television in Sioux Falls, which has earned the ``Friend in Need'' Service to America Award from The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB). The station is being recognized for its outstanding efforts before, during, and after the devastating tornado which struck the town of Spencer, South Dakota last spring. 
   As weather conditions deteriorated on May 30, 1998, KELO provided quick, expert warnings to the Spencer area, giving viewers 20 minutes of advance warning. While we lost six citizens in the tornado, the losses could have been much worse if not for the advance warning that gave the community the critical time needed to take cover. KELO provided continual coverage throughout the night of the storm, without regard to the advertising revenues that would surely be lost. 
   KELO did not stop there. After the tornado ripped through Spencer, KELO documented the widespread destruction of homes, businesses, and infrastructure. The community desperately needed help, and KELO turned their cameras on themselves to host a telethon which raised more than $750,000 to assist victims as they struggled to rebuild their homes and lives. During the rebuilding efforts, KELO continued extended coverage that helped bring closure to the tragedy. 
   Our broadcast stations provide many important community services, but none as important as tracking severe weather and providing warnings. KELO has proven it is a true community partner, and South Dakota will be forever grateful to KELO and our other broadcasters who often put themselves in harm's way to serve others. I congratulate KELO on this very special recognition from the National Association of Broadcasters and extend my personal thanks for a job well done.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the important contribution Taiwan has made to the international effort to provide humanitarian assistance to the refugees of Kosovo. Taiwan recently announced that it will grant $300 million in an aid package to the Kosovars. The aid package will include emergency support for food, shelters, medical care, and education for Kosovar refugees who were driven from their homes and forced to live in exile. In addition, I am pleased that Taiwan has offered short-term accommodations for Kosovar refugees in Taiwan along with technical training in Taiwan to help the refugees be better equipped for the restoration of their homeland upon their return. 
   Slobadan Milosevic initiated a brutal and calculated effort to rid Kosovo of ethnic Albanians and fracture Europe. The United States and its NATO allies moved quickly and decisively to stop the massacres of innocent women and children inside Kosovo, and the international community joined the effort to provide relief to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled homes burned by Yugoslav police. 
   Over two months of NATO bombings resulted in the withdrawal of all Yugoslav military and police from Kosovo and Milosevic's acceptance of a NATO-led peacekeeping force to secure Kosovo for the refugees return. The rebuilding and recovery efforts that are now beginning in Kosovo will take many years and many resources. Taiwan has contributed significant financial and technical resources to this effort. However, more importantly, Taiwan's generous actions should give comfort to the people of Kosovo that the world's leaders will help them through this difficult time.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as we enter the twilight of the Twentieth Century, we can look back at the immense multitude of achievements that led to the ascension of the United States of America as the preeminent nation in modern history. We owe this title as world's greatest superpower in large part to the twenty-five million men and women who served in our armed services and who defended the principles and ideals of our nation. 
   Before we embark upon the Twenty-First Century, the American Legion will celebrate its 80th anniversary serving our nation's veterans. Since the first gathering of American World War I Doughboys in Paris, France on March 15th, 1919, the American Legion has upheld the values of freedom, justice, respect and equality. The American Legion eventually was chartered by Congress in 1919 as a patriotic, mutual-help, war-time veterans organization. A community-service organization which now numbers nearly 3 million members--men and women--in nearly 15,000 American Legion Posts worldwide. 
   The American Legion's support for our nation's veterans has been exemplary over the last eighty years. Shortly after it's founding, the American Legion successfully lobbied for the creation of a federal veterans bureau. With the American Legion's support, the agency developed a veterans hospital system in the 1930s. In 1989, another American Legion plan became reality: the elevation of the Department of Veterans Affairs as a cabinet-level agency. The American Legion also successfully advocated for the compensatory rights of veterans, victims of atomic radiation, PTSD, Agent Orange, and Persian Gulf syndrome. 
   Over the past eighty years, the American Legion also has been active in promoting the values of patriotism and competition with our nation's young people. There are many sons and daughters participating in American Legion sponsored programs such as American Legion Boys and Girls State, Boys and Girls Nation, the National High School Oratorical Contest, and the Junior Shooting Sports and American Legion Baseball. 
   Throughout my service in Congress, I have long appreciated the leadership of the South Dakota American Legion for its input on a variety of issues impacting veterans and their families in recent years. The American Legion's insight and efforts have proven very valuable to me and my staff, and I commend each and every one of them for their leadership on issues of importance to all veterans of the armed forces. 
   Mr. President, as Americans, we should never forget the men and women who served our nation with such dedication and patriotism. I close my remarks by offering my gratitude and support for all the achievements performed by the American Legion. For eighty years now, the American Legion has been the standard bearer in the representation of our veterans. I want to extend my sincerest appreciation to the American Legion for its continued leadership.

We owe this title as world's greatest superpower in large part to the twenty-five million men and women who served in our armed services and who defended the principles and ideals of our nation. 
   Before we embark upon the Twenty-First Century, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) will celebrate an historic milestone. On September 29, the VFW will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the organization's founding. For over one hundred years, the VFW has supported our armed forces from the battlefields to the home front. From letter-writing campaigns in WWI to ``welcome home'' rallies after the Persian Gulf War to care packages sent to Bosnia, the VFW continues to take pride in supporting American troops overseas. 
   The VFW's support for our nation's armed forces has been exemplary over the last one hundred years, but it is the VFW's work with our nation's veterans that has been most impressive. The original intention of the VFW, in fact, was to ensure that the veterans of the Spanish-American war would not be forgotten and that they received medical care and support in return for their service and sacrifice. The VFW's motto, ``Honor The Dead By Honoring The Living'', resonates to this day and will carry forth into the next century. Since organizing the first national veterans service office in 1919, to today's nationwide network of service offices, the VFW provides the assistance veterans need in order to obtain much-deserved benefits. 
   To celebrate this prestigious occasion, a resolution, S. J. Resolution 21, has been introduced in the United States Senate designating September 29, 1999 as ``Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States Day'', and the President of the United States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon all Government agencies and the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities. I am a proud cosponsor of this resolution which honors the VFW's recognition of military service and remembrance of the sacrifices made in our nation's defense. I feel this resolution presents an opportunity to recognize, honor, and pay tribute to the more than 2,000,000 veterans of the armed forces represented by the VFW, and to all the individuals who have served in the armed forces 
   Throughout my service in Congress, I have long appreciated the leadership of both the South Dakota VFW and the Ladies Auxiliary for their input on a variety of issues impacting veterans and their families in recent years. Their insight and efforts have proven very valuable to me and my staff, and I commend each and every one of them for their leadership on issues of importance to all veterans of the armed forces. I was honored to have the  VFW's strong support when I offered my amendment to increase veterans health care in this year's budget to $3 billion. Even though it wasn't the full amount of my amendment, the final Budget Resolution contained a $1.7 billion increase above what the Clinton Administration had requested for veterans health care. This never would have been possible without the grassroots support of the VFW. 
   Mr. President, as Americans, we should never forget the men and women who served our nation with such dedication and patriotism. I close my remarks by offering my gratitude and support for all the achievements performed by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. For a century, this organization has been the standard bearer in the representation of our veterans, as well as their undying patronage to our armed forces and support for the maintenance of a strong national defense.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment for myself and Senators THOMAS and KERREY. I thank Senators DASCHLE, DORGAN, KOHL, and LINCOLN, who are also cosponsors of this amendment. 
   I believe that several of my colleagues plan to speak in behalf of this important effort. 
   This amendment addresses the issue of unitary thrift charters. 
   Initially this amendment also dealt with an unnecessary owners provision that needlessly penalizes thrifts by removing the FICO insurance differential from the underlying bill. However, Chairman GRAMM has offered an amendment that accomplishes that portion of the original amendment. Nonetheless, the remaining unitary thrift issue must be addressed, and that is what this amendment does. 
   Thrifts are different from banks. Many believe that a thrift charter is superior to a bank charter. It gives thrifts more flexibility. It also demands certain specific things of them. 
   We recently went through an extensive debate over the merits of the thrift charter. I don't want to open old debates. I do seek, however, to close a loophole that permits the dangerous combination of banking and commerce. Under current law, commercial firms can own and operate unitary thrifts. That is the only breach of the banking and commerce firewalls currently allowed under our financial services law. Of course, the Glass-Steagall repeal and other opponents of this legislation open a range of financial activities to each other. But this bill is carefully structured to prevent the mixing of banking and commerce and closes the single loophole that remains where banking and commerce can mix. 
   Let me explain what this amendment would to. There has been some misperception floating around about it. But I have made the language available for review now for a number of days. 
   The Johnson-Thomas-Kerrey amendment does not interfere with the current ownership of thrifts. Any commercial firms that currently own a unitary thrift charter will be able to continue to own and operate their institution without restriction. Their current status would be undisturbed. Existing unitary thrifts would be grandfathered and can still sell themselves to any of the thousands of other financial entities that exist in our country. There will remain a strong market for the sale of unitary thrifts--no doubt about that. 
   The only limitation this amendment would impose involves the transferability of the charter. The charter would not be 
   transferable to another commercial entity. Any bank, insurance company, or security firm that wanted to acquire a charter could do so. A new entity could be created to operate that thrift. 
   This amendment brings the two issues that concern the thrift industry to a consensus compromise which addresses the issues most critical to average banks and average thrifts. It restores the language agreed to in last year's agreement effort in H.R. 10. That agreement, which is embodied in this amendment, was supported by the banks and by the thrifts. It also received the overwhelming support of the Senate Banking Committee. House Banking Committee Chairman LEACH also supports closing this loophole. 
   Moreover, this amendment would further the goals of financial modernization by leveling the playing field between banks and thrifts and remove the dangerous threat of further weakening the walls between banking and commerce.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I commend the chairman for his work on the differential issue, which was originally a component of the Johnson-Thomas amendment. But we need to go further. It is an opportunity for this body to implement a financial services policy consistent with where both the banking and consumer organizations of the country want to go to implement policy that is agreed upon, in the agreed-upon direction that Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Rubin want to go. This is an opportunity that we cannot allow to be missed.

   Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator. It would seem to me at this point there is no constitutional mandate that for some reason we must go down the road of mixing banking and commerce, that that is some of an irretrievable decision that is made and we are unable now to change that policy. This is an opportunity, I believe, to do what needs to be done in this legislation. One, to strike the provision of the bill which would, as it stands, permit commercial firms to acquire any of the 500 existing unitary thrift holding companies. And our amendment inserts a provision to allow existing unitary thrift holding companies to be transferred only to financial firms. 
   There are thousands of financial firms. The marketability of these unitary thrifts will remain high; there is no question about that. So I believe this is an amendment that is badly needed if this bill is going to ultimately be signed by the President. But it is also an amendment that is necessary for us to embark on what I think is a sensible and prudent fiscal policy, financial policy for this country. I ask support for the Johnson-Thomas amendment. 
   I yield back such time as I may have remaining.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, financial modernization should go forward but without mixing financial services and commerce. Preserving the unitary thrift loophole should not be allowed. Who believes this should be closed? Chairman LEACH, Chairman of the House Banking Committee, Fed Chairman Greenspan, and former Fed Chairman Volcker, Treasury Secretary Rubin, and banking and consumer organizations. There is bipartisan and, frankly, overwhelming support for loophole closure. I think there is a sense we do not want to go down the road of financial services and commerce mixing at this particular juncture. Allowing financial modernization to go forward should occur, but allowing unitary thrifts to merge with other financial institutions is the road to go rather than allowing merger with commerce at large. 
   I think we need to heed the urgent warnings of our Nation's leading economic minds. We appreciate that this issue is arcane in the minds of many in this body, no doubt. But when we have the support for closure of this loophole coming from the chairman of the House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Rubin, and Mr. Volcker, I think that ought to be compelling support for taking this step to make sure, in fact, we get a financial modernization bill out of this body that will, in fact, be signed by the President and will serve this country in good stead. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Railroad Car Visibility Act, which would require all railroad cars--including those on passenger an commuter trains--to have some form of reflective marker. 
   This legislation provides a simply way to improve rail car visibility at rail crossings and sidings, sites where many accidents have occurred in recent years. When crossings and sidings are in rural areas or near small towns--as is often the case in South Dakota--they usually are unlit or very poorly lit, increasing the potential for disaster. While locomotives are required to use lighting such as ditch lights to increase visibility, rail cars are often unmarked, which means they are difficult for automobile drivers to see. This legislation attempts to remedy this problem by requiring that all rail cars display some form of visible marker, such as reflectors of reflective tape. 
   Last year, the Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a memorandum on reflective markings and their effectiveness for increasing visibility. DOT tested several different types of reflectors, including different colors and patterns, The memorandum concludes that ``bright color patterns distributed to give an indication of the size or shape of the rail car make the most effective marking systems.'' Fitting rail cars with reflective materials would be relatively inexpensive but, by increasing visibility, would reduce the number of accidents, unnecessary injuries and deaths at rail crossings and sidings. As one railroad executive has said, ``It's sort of a tragedy that something that makes so much common sense has to be legislated. Everyone should do it. The railroad industry is its own worst enemy sometimes. 
   This legislation has the support of both South Dakota's legislature and Governor Janklow. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and work with me to secure its passage.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to recognize an extraordinary group of citizens who came together to address their community needs in building a new fire hall. The old facility, which has served so faithfully for so many decades, had reached the limits of its productivity in February 1997, when the record snowfall created great stress on the roof. The need for action was immediate, and the Sisseton Community responded quickly. Members of the Sisseton Fire Department and Roberts County Rescue mounted a financial campaign to raise the additional money needed above what national, state, tribal, and local governments were able to provide. Fire fighters and rescue volunteers donated extra time by holding fundraising activities in addition to their fire and rescue responsibilities. Local businesses and individuals responded generously. The new fire hall is now a reality. It has become a true emergency operating center that the entire Sisseton community can look toward with pride. 
   I commend the entire community for this exemplary effort, and hold it up as a shining example of the sense of community which still exists in places like Sisseton, SD.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like to talk briefly on the critically important hearings being conducted in Congress regarding the alleged national security breaks at our Department of Energy nuclear weapons laboratories. As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I am committed to finding the answer to what may have happened and ensure that our national security is just that--secure. 
   I share the concern of most Americans that starting during the Reagan Administration, Chinese spies reportedly stole secrets from New Mexico's Los Alamos National Laboratory to assist China in developing advanced nuclear weapons. I am also concerned with the perceived inaction by individuals and agencies within our government for almost ten years. However, I strongly discourage my colleagues and others in framing this issue in partisan terms because the timeline we are discussing here today includes three Administrations of both parties. The goal of placing blame on Republicans or Democrats is counterproductive to the ultimate need of finding answers that lead to solutions. 
   The American public is entitled to know whether critically important secrets were stolen from our nuclear laboratories. We, as citizens of a democracy, also have the right to know what steps our government took--or failed to take--to protect our interests and livelihood. The accusations surrounding the Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory have shaken the trust Americans have in our national security, our government, and our developing relationship with China, the most populated country in the world. It is the responsibility of this committee, Congress as a whole, and the Administration to provide the American public with the answers they deserve. 
   Accountability and accuracy must be established in this matter. However, knowing what happened and who was responsible is not enough. I am hopeful that out of this committee hearing and  subsequent investigations by other Congressional committees and governmental agencies, we can make sure our national security secrets are safe in a world where it is inevitable and necessary that scientists from different countries work together. 
   Action must be taken if it is found that security lagged and individuals failed to respond in a timely and appropriate manner. Action must also be taken if it is found that foreign governments actively spied in our nuclear laboratories. However, we will not know what action is necessary until all the information is presented. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this issue and will continue to work to ensure that important questions are answered fully.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank Senator LAUTENBERG for his leadership on this budget resolution. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, it has been an honor and, I have to say, also, unfortunately, somewhat of a frustration to have participated in this process in the committee and to see now what has come to the floor. 
   I am saddened that what could have been a watershed opportunity for the American people--to lay out a budget that makes sense, which establishes the proper priorities for the coming years--apparently is going to be missed and profoundly missed in a very unfortunate way. 
   It is remarkable how we arrived at this point. When I first came to the Congress as a Member of the other body some 12 or 13 years ago, I had some doubts that I would ever see the collapse of the Soviet Union, the fall of the Berlin Wall, or debate how to utilize a Federal budget surplus, but here we are. 
   We do have that opportunity, last year having been a surplus year, at least under a unified budget. And this year, which ends September 30, the projections are that we will be at least $130 billion in the black for this coming fiscal year. Again, let me be clear that in the unified budget, all of those surplus dollars are attributable to Social  Security, lest anyone gets too carried away about spending the surpluses that are here in the near term. 
   It seems to me that throughout this debate that there are four principles that ought to be followed as we craft a roadmap for where we go from here, from this fork in the road that we thankfully have come to. This crossroads follows on the heels of the 1993 budget agreement and was supplemented by the 1997 budget agreement, both of which I voted for. It seems to me we ought first protect Social Security and Medicare--not just Social Security, but protect them both. 
   It seems to me that a significant portion of resources that we come into ought to be used to pay down already-existing debt. When Jimmy Carter concluded his Presidency, this Nation had an accumulated debt of around $1 trillion. That exploded to $5.5 trillion, mostly through the borrow-and-spend policies of the 1980s. Now we have an obligation to pay that debt down, reduce debt service, reduce the cost of money, and free up resources for the private sector so buying a house, buying a car, sending a kid to college, and expanding a business become more affordable. 
   Third, we do need to look at tax relief, but we need to do so in a careful manner. We should not commit dollars that we do not have, those that are only projected far, far into the future. There is talk on this floor about how we are going to spend surpluses available to us 15 years down the road, surpluses of massive proportions. We have seen in the past what has happened with budget projections from both the OMB and CBO. We know the availability of those dollars may or may not occur. It seems to me a great deal of restraint ought to be used on the part of both political parties, for both spending and tax relief, when making plans premised on dollars that may or may not be available in the future. 
   But I do believe over the near term we ought to try to design a budget package that will provide some level of tax relief for people in this country, primarily for middle-class and working families. There is a very legitimate role to be played for a tax relief package, but it can only be part of an overall strategy. 
   Last of the four items that I think we need to take into consideration are the key investments that need to be made. I think the American people feel the same way. The American people want some tax relief, but they also want to see Social Security and Medicare protected. They also want to do some things for our schools, environment, kids, and communities. It is that kind of balanced agenda that makes some sense. To repudiate the ability to make the key investments that need to be made, I think, reflects an ideological orientation to this budget that is far away from where the American people are. 
   There is little wonder in my mind, frankly, why poll after poll shows the American people overwhelmingly rejecting what has become the Republican budget agenda in the House and the Senate. The Republican agenda is lopsided--not balanced, thoughtful, or progressive--and it does not do the things the American people want to see happen. All of the money essentially goes toward tax relief, aside from an increase in defense and a couple of other assorted very narrow increases. Because of this budgeting, we are going to wind up by the year 2004, which is only 5 years down the road, with cuts growing from 11 percent this year to some 27 percent. These are, in effect, shutdown types of cuts for programs like Head Start and Meals on Wheels and toxic waste cleanup and for Women, Infants, and Children, and Border Patrol, not to mention community health clinics, environmental initiatives, funding for our national parks and rural development. All of these programs 
   are at tremendous jeopardy because of the very one-sided, very lopsided, and, I think, unthoughtful approach that we are being presented on the floor of the Senate today. 
   On top of that, while there is some provision for an increase in education funding in this budget resolution, it is far smaller than that included in the Senate budget resolution; the increase of $2.6 billion is now only $259 million for fiscal year 2000. This budget puts out of reach our ability to deal constructively with the need to renovate and build new schools, to provide the numbers of new teachers we need, and to supply the technology we need in our schools. 
   In my State of South Dakota we are seeing bond issue after bond issue go down all across the State because people find they simply do not have the resources to make the investments in school facilities that need to be made. Yet we are walking away from what could be a very constructive and commonsense partnership--where the decisionmaking is left at the local school level but the financial partnership is among Federal, State, and local governments--that could make quality educational opportunities for our kids a realistic possibility in the next century. 
   The situation is similar for child care. While the Senate accepted the amendment of Senators DODD and JEFFORDS that provided an additional $12.5 billion over 10 years for existing childcare and development block grants, the conference report cuts that by $9.5 billion. So, again, we are denied the ability over the long haul to make the investments needed, even in a block grant fashion. It leaves the decisionmaking and flexibility to the States to invest in the kinds of programs that I think every American sees need to be made for our kids--afterschool programs, day-care programs. These are the things we need to do if we are going to invest in the minds of children so they can go on to have successful lives and take care of their own needs. 
   I am pleased because the amendment that Senator WELLSTONE and I offered on the Senate floor, which would have resulted in a total increase of $3 billion in VA health care funding and which was accepted here, has been, for the most part, retained. This conference report calls for a $2 billion level of increase. That is not as much as I would like to see or Senator WELLSTONE would like to see. It is not what our veterans' groups would like to see. It is an improvement, however, over where this body was earlier. It will make a significant positive difference. We will come back and see what we can do in future years to augment funding for veterans' health care. But I think getting $2 out of $3 billion when we started with zero is progress. It is a step in the right direction, I would have to say. 
   I want to share with Senator BOXER my profound disappointment at the deletion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Reserve Fund. This was an opportunity we had. We had bipartisan support in the Budget Committee and bipartisan support on the floor of the Senate to have the opportunity to set aside offshore drilling resources to be utilized for the benefit of the environment and our National Park System in this country. Yet we are going to be denied that opportunity because of the deletion of that provision from this budget resolution. No matter how we come together in future debates, authorizing legislation about reinvigorating our park system with some additional resources from oil revenues, we are not going to have the opportunity to be as effective as we could have been. So I am disappointed about that portion of the conference report as well. 
   It is remarkable that we arrived at this point where we can talk about surpluses. There are many people who are no longer with us because they voted, with courage and with integrity, for past budget-balancing legislation--most notably the 1993 budget agreement that passed with no support from any Republican in either the House or the Senate. A great many Democrats lost their seats because of that vote. Yet now we find ourselves not with the $292 
   billion annual deficit that this country had 6 years ago but with a $131 billion surplus. 
   President Bush, to his credit, supported the 1990 budget agreement. I have to say, in all candor, a contributing factor to his loss of the Presidency was the fact that he supported the precursor to our 1993 budget agreement. Again, in politics sometimes, no good deed goes unpunished, and that has been the case with some of our past budget legislation. 
   I will have to say now we are at this watershed opportunity. There are some positive provisions in the budget resolution, and I applaud the sponsors for that. I applaud Senator DOMENICI for that. But there are so many missed opportunities; a roadmap to where the  American people want to go simply is not there. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue. I think commonsense, moderate, mainstream Americans know where they want to go--providing some tax relief but also paying down some debt; making key investments in our kids, our communities, and our schools. Those opportunities, unfortunately, in this roadmap are lost. 
   I yield such time as I may have.

   Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I thank my colleague from South Dakota, Senator DASCHLE, for his great work on this amendment. 
   What we have here is a very fundamental priority decision that this Congress needs to make. The question is not whether we will have tax relief or not. Certainly we will have tax relief. The question is whether we have a commonsense kind of budget that also allows for some key investments, in this case in agriculture. Are we going to preserve the strongest agricultural system in the world that provides the highest quality, most affordable food in the world or not? 
   To say that we have an $800 billion tax relief package and there is no room for $6 billion of investment in our ag sector simply makes no sense. The American people see through the budget resolution on the floor. They know that they want some tax relief, especially if it is targeted to middle-class and working families. But they also know that we need to make some key strategic investments in important sectors of our economy. Nothing is more important than agriculture as we craft ways to get a better price out of the market, as we craft ways to keep a fine meshed system of family farms and ranches all across America. But as things are going right now, we are headed for a catastrophic train wreck in agriculture.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I was pleased that I was able to join with my colleague Mr. WELLSTONE from Minnesota in passing an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2000 budget resolution to increase funding for veterans health care. This amendment will help correct a serious injustice to our nation's veterans that I believe demands urgent attention by Congress and the Clinton Administration. 
   This will be the fourth consecutive year, that the Clinton Administration has proposed a flat-line appropriation for veterans' health care in its FY 2000 budget request. The VA's budget includes a $17.3 billion appropriation request for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Although, the Clinton Administration's request includes allowing the VA to collect approximately $749 million from third-party insurers--$124 million more than in FY 1999, this cap on medical spending places a greater strain on the quality of patient care currently provided in our nation's VA facility, especially when meeting the needs and high health costs of our rapidly aging World War II population. 
   In a memo to VA Secretary Togo West, Under Secretary for Health Dr. Kenneth Kizer expressed concern that the Administration's FY 2000 requested budget ``poses very serious financial challenges which can only be met if decisive and timely actions are taken.'' He indicates that cuts must be made now to preclude even deeper cuts such as ``mandatory employee furloughs, severe curtailment of services or elimination of programs, and possible unnecessary facility closures.'' Dr. Kizer also states that ``..... changes are absolutely essential if we are to prepare ourselves for the limitations inherent in the proposed FY 2000 budget.'' 
   I have met with several representatives of South Dakota's veterans' organizations who have expressed their justifiable fears and frustrations that the VA's flat-lined health care budget is causing mandatory reductions in outpatient and inpatient care and VA staff levels. Since 1992, over 150 full-time employees at the Ft. Meade VA facility have been cut do to insufficient budgets. There are legitimate fears in South Dakota that inpatient care will be eliminated from one of our VA facilities if an immediate solution is not found to augment the VA's budget. 
   Peter Henry, Director of the Ft. Meade/Hot Springs VA facilities has been raiding from other budgets and has been forced to close other services in order to provide health care for veterans in western South Dakota. If the FY 2000 VA budget is not increased, Dr. Henry will soon be forced to reduce inpatient care and could result in possible denial of certain category veterans. 
   South Dakota's veterans are tired of hearing what the VA cannot do for them. It is time for Congress and the VA to tell veterans ``Yes, we can and will help you.'' 
   Many of South Dakota's 70,000 veterans contend that four years of flat-lined budgets for VA health care has left the system in danger of losing as many as 8,000 employees nationwide, eliminating health care programs and possibly closing VA facilities like the one in Sioux Falls. I have heard from people like Harry VandeMore, a Korean war veteran, who said, ``There was plenty of money to send me to Korea. There was plenty of money for hand grenades, plenty of money for rifle shells. I guess the government would like to throw me out in the weeds. I don't know where I would go for health care [without the VA]. The days of the hospital here in Sioux Falls are numbered if this keeps up.'' 
   Gene Murphy, a former national commander of the Disabled American Veterans and now state adjutant for the South Dakota DAV, feels that ``. . . our government is always happy to send us off to war, but apparently they're not so happy to take care of us when we come back.'' 
   Since I began my service in Congress over twelve years ago, I have held countless meetings, marched in small town Memorial Day parades, and participated in Veterans Day tributes with South Dakota's veterans. As the years go on their concerns remain the same. To ensure that Congress provides the VA with adequate funding to meet the health care needs for all veterans. Without additional funding South Dakota VA facilities will continue to face staff reductions, cutbacks in programs, and possible closing of facilities. 
   Too often, I have received letters from veterans who must wait up to three months to see a doctor. For many veterans who do not have any other form of health insurance, the VA is the only place they can go to receive medical attention. They were promised medical care when they completed their service and now many veterans are having to jump through hoops just to see a doctor. 
   Our nation's veterans groups have worked extensively on crafting a sensible budget that will allow the VA to  provide the necessary care to all veterans. They have offered an Independent Budget that calls for an immediate $3 billion increase for VA health care to rectify two current deficiencies in the VA budget. First, the VA has had to reduce expenditures by $1.3 billion due to their flatlined budget at $17.3 billion. These were mandatory reductions in outpatient and inpatient care and VA staff levels that the VA had to make due to their flatlined budget. 
   The remaining $1.7 billion is needed to keep up with medical inflation, COLAs for VA employees, new medical initiatives that the VA wants to begin (Hepatitis C screenings, emergency care services), long term health care costs, funding for homeless veterans, and treating 54,000 new patients in 89 outpatient clinics. 
   Mr. President, as a member of the Budget Committee I was encouraged that an additional $1 billion was added for veterans health care. Although this will help relieve some of the VA's budgetary constraints, I believe that more needs to be done. The veterans community has requested that VA health care needs to be augmented by $3 billion to ensure the provision of accessible and high quality services to veterans. That is why I offered an amendment during the Budget Committee mark up of the budget resolution that would have raised VA health care by an additional $2 billion. The nation's top veterans groups (AMVETS, Blinded Veterans Association, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars and Vietnam Veterans of America) voiced their strong support for my amendment in a letter that I shared with members of the Committee. Unfortunately, my amendment failed 11-11. 
   Therefore, I along with Senator WELLSTONE offered an amendment that once again increased veterans health care by $2 billion. I was pleased that the Senate accepted my amendment by a vote of 99-0. The future of health care for veterans at the Sioux Falls, Hot Springs, and Ft. Meade VA facilities and in VA hospitals across the country will be sustained by this $3 billion total increase for veterans health care. The VA must be provided with every resource to provide quality care for all eligible veterans who walk into a VA facility. 
   Mr. President, I feel that our VA facilities are on the verge of a catastrophic collapse if we continue to remain idle on this issue. In 1972, the Sioux Falls VA medical facility contained 269 beds for inpatient care. Today, they are down to 44 beds. This is a facility that saw 75,000 people walk through their doors last year. Some veterans have told me that when they go to the VA they see more janitors than nurses. This is unacceptable. If we want to provide care for all eligible veterans who walk into a VA facility Congress needs to act now. 
   The funding required for this amendment represents a minute fraction of the total federal budget that we are debating here today. However, the funding we set aside to improve accessibility and quality of care within our veterans health care system will provide a tremendous boost for an already stretched and fractured VA medical system. 
   As we enter the twilight of the Twentieth Century, we can look back at the immense multitude of achievements that led to the ascension of the United States of America as the preeminent nation in modern history. We owe this title as world's greatest superpower in large part to the twenty-five million men and women who served in our armed services and who defended the principles and ideals of our nation. 
   From the battlefields of Lexington and Concord, to the beaches of Normandy, and to the deserts of the Persian Gulf, our nation's history is replete with men and women who, during the savagery of battle, were willing to forego their own survival not only to protect the lives of their comrades, but because they believed that peace and freedom was too invaluable a right to be vanquished. Americans should never forget our veterans who served our nation with such dedication and patriotism. 
   Mr. President, I want to thank Senator WELLSTONE and my Senate colleagues for supporting my amendment. Acceptance of my amendment was just one victory in the war to provide decent, affordable health care for South Dakota's veterans. By passing this amendment we live up to our obligation to our nation's veterans and ensure that they are treated with the respect and honor that they so richly deserve.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I oppose the Republican Budget Resolution because it supports the wrong priorities. 
   1998 was an exceptional year in this country's modern economic history. We enjoyed the first budget surplus in 29 years and the economy exceeded expectations and continued to expand in the face of international instability--unemployment remained low; wages continued to increase; welfare recipients declined; home ownership increased; and interest rates remained low. All of is good news has allowed the White House, the Congress, and the American people to begin debating how to use future surpluses which are projected for the foreseeable future. 
   As a Member of Congress who arrived in Washington when the annual federal budget deficit was over $220 billion and still growing, I am extremely pleased and a little amazed that we have gotten to where we are today. That said, I think it is extremely important that Congress proceed carefully in the coming years to ensure we make wise choices that will keep this country's budget running in the black for years to come. 
   Writing the FY 2000 budget is our first test of how we will handle existing and future surpluses to ensure long-term economic growth and stability, and it is a test too important to coming generations for us to fail. I believe that this year's budget resolution should follow four principles: first, we must save Social Security and Medicare; second, we should pay down the national debt; third, we should support targeted tax relief to low and middle-income Americans; and finally, we should identify and support critically needed discretionary priorities. 
   Unfortunately, the Republican Budget Resolution doesn't follow these principles, which I believe are critical to balancing the many pressing needs of this nation. First, the Republican Budget Resolution does nothing to preserve Medicare. Second, while I support targeted tax cuts, I cannot support the  use of essentially all future on-budget surpluses for tax cuts at the expense of Medicare solvency and other critical discretionary investments such as veterans health care. Third, the Republican budget resolution reduces non-defense discretionary spending by $20 billion in FY 2000. Finally, while the resolution increases funding for some programs and protects others from cuts, the bottom line is that discretional programs such as agriculture, head start, law enforcement, and many other critically important programs could be cut by more than 12% under the Republican Budget Resolution. I support preserving the discretionary caps and acknowledge that the caps force many tough decisions on decisions on discretionary spending priorities. However, I firmly believe that we can do a better job of balancing discretionary priorities than what is included in the Republican Budget Resolution.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator EDWARD M. KENNEDY, today by introducing the ``Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of 1999''. Earlier this year, Representatives TOM ALLEN, JIM TURNER, MARION BARRY, AND HENRY WAXMAN were joined by sixty-one of their colleagues when they introduced H.R. 664, ``The Prescription Drug Fairness For Seniors Act of 1999'' in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   This legislation addresses the critical issue facing our older Americans--the cost of their prescription drugs. Studies have shown that older Americans spend almost three times as much of their income (21%) on health care than those under the age of 65 (8%), and more than three-quarters of Americans aged 65 and over are taking prescription drugs. Even more alarming is the fact that seniors and others who buy their own prescription drugs, are forced to pay over twice as much for their drugs as are the drug manufacturers' most favored customers, such as the federal government and large HMOs. 
   The ``Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act'' will protect senior citizens from drug price discrimination and make prescription drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries at substantially reduced prices. The legislation achieves these goals by allowing pharmacies that serve Medicare beneficiaries to purchase prescription drugs at the low prices available under the Federal Supply Schedule, similar to the Veterans Administration, Public Health Service and Indian Health Service. Estimated to reduce prescription drug prices for seniors by over 40%, this bill will help those seniors who often times have to make devastating choices between buying food or medications. Choices that no human being should have to make. 
   Research and development of new drug therapies is an important and necessary tool towards improving a persons quality of life. But due to the high price tag that often accompanies the latest drug therapies, seniors are often left without access to these new therapies, and ultimately, in far too many instances, without access to medication at all. This legislation is an important step towa4rds restoring the access to affordable medications for our medicare beneficiaries. I look forward to working on this important issue in the months to come and hope that Congress will work swiftly in a bipartisan manner to enact legislation that will benefit millions of senior citizens across our nation.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, yesterday, American men and women joined their military counterparts from 18 NATO countries in attacking the forces of Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia. I had hoped that recent diplomatic efforts by the United States and others would have led instead to a peace agreement in the Balkans. However, Slobodan Milosevic's continued aggression toward Kosovar Albanians and his unwillingness to seek a lasting peace could no longer go unchecked. 
   My wife and I know first hand what thousands of American families are  feeling today, seeing their husbands, wives, sons, or daughters in the military travel overseas to face combat. My son, Brooks, recently returned from a tour of duty with the U.S. Army in Bosnia where he was part of the multi-national effort to maintain peace in that war-torn country. The decision to commit U.S. troops overseas is never easy, nor should it be done without a clear understanding of our country's interests and goals. In the case of Kosovo, our country's interests are clear and warrant the current military action. A lasting peace is directly linked with stability in Europe, and it is our duty to participate in a multi-national effort to prevent the ethnic cleansing currently occurring in Kosovo. 
   This century's major wars started in the Balkans. Hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions of others around the world died as a result of conflict in this region. Slobodan Milosevic directly threatens the current political and economic stability of Europe, and today's military action against Milosevic is necessary to prevent an inevitable escalation of violence. The fighting in Kosovo could easily spread to neighboring Montenegro, Macedonia, and Albania, and has already destabilized the region. A sea of ethnic Albanian refugees have attempted to flee Kosovo, only to be denied entry in some countries while further straining age-old tensions in others. There is an undeniable possibility for widespread conflict among Kosovo's neighbors, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Greece, and it is in our national strategic interest to prevent a fourth Balkan war. 
   The United States and NATO have an opportunity to stop the cold blooded murders of thousands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Since Slobodan Milosevic began his reign of terror against Albanians in Kosovo, over 250,000 people--10 percent of the population--have been forced from their homes. Another 170,000 have fled the Yugoslav province in the past year. Milosevic's police forces and military have burned homes, preventing the return of entire villages. The reports of atrocities by Milosevic against the ethnic Albanians are sickening and invoke images of Bosnia and Nazi Germany. Since the first massacre of ethnic Albanians at Drenica, last year, thousands more ethnic Albanians have been killed by Serb paramilitary units and the Yugoslav Army, including the January 16 discovery of 45 slaughtered ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo village of Racak. 
   While I support air strikes now to prevent further bloodshed, I will continue to promote diplomatic efforts to ultimately resolve this crisis in Kosovo. This multi-national military action will illustrate to Slobodan Milosevic the resolve of all democratic nations in the world to reject oppression, and it is my hope that Slobodan Milosevic will bring the people of Yugoslavia back from the brink of one man's madness. 
   My thoughts and prayers are with our men and women overseas and their families here at home. I fully support their efforts to bring peace and stability to the region and wish them all a quick and safe return home.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I think we can engage in this debate in a relatively brief amount of time. But it is, I think, an issue that is fundamental. I applaud the Budget Committee chairman, Mr. DOMENICI, for working to try to find ways to augment the veterans' health care budget for the coming fiscal year. 
   The Presidential budget called for a flatline budget going on for 4 years. We have had 3 years already in the flatline budget at the VA, despite the fact that we have an enormous number of World War II age vets needing a greater amount of medical care and that we have increased inflation in health care costs. 
   The independent budget, prepared by prominent veterans organizations in this country, has proposed conservatively that we need an additional $3 billion for veterans' health care in the coming year. Chairman DOMENICI has provided for a $1 billion increase. I applaud him for that but recognize that still falls far short of where we need to go. 
   It is clear, from testimony that this Congress has received, that if we do not make some further adjustments upward we are going to wind up with a train wreck in terms of veterans' health care. We are going to wind up with mandatory employee furloughs, a severe curtailment of services, or the elimination of programs and, inevitably, facility closures around this country. 
   The amendment pending before the Senate would add the additional $2 billion to provide for that $3 billion increase for fiscal year 2000. The offset would come from an across-the-board reduction in the nondefense discretionary budget for this year. 
   Along with that goes a sense of the Senate that states:

   Mr. JOHNSON. As Senator WELLSTONE expressed so eloquently, this adjustment would allow for the VA to keep up with medical inflation and for them to retain the needed employees that they need to deliver these services. It would allow for new medical initiatives the Congress had been pushing the VA to begin, including hepatitis C screenings and emergency care services. It would allow for addressing long-term care costs, funding for homeless veterans, in compliance with any Patients' Bill of Rights legislation this Congress enacts. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator KYL in introducing the Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act. The Kyl-Johnson bill will require federal prisoners to pay a nominal fee when they initiate certain visits for medical attention. Fees collected from prisoners will either be paid as restitution to victims or be deposited into the Federal Crime Victims' Fund. My state of South Dakota is one of 34 states that have implemented state-wide prisoner health care copayment programs. The Department of Justice supports extending this prisoner health care copayment program to federal prisoners in an attempt to reduce unnecessary medical procedures and ensure that adequate health care services are available for prisoners who need them. 
   My interest in the prisoner health care copayment issue came from discussions I had in South Dakota with a number of law enforcement officials and US Marshal Lyle Swenson about the equitable treatment between pre-sentencing federal prisoners housed in county jails and the county prisoners residing in those same facilities. Currently, county prisoners in South Dakota are subject to state and local laws allowing the collection of a health care copayment, while Marshals Service prisoners are not, thereby allowing federal prisoners to abuse health care resources at great cost to state and local law enforcement. 
   I want to thank Senator KYL for working with me on specific concerns raised by South Dakota law enforcement officials and the US Marshals Service that I wanted addressed in the bill. I sincerely appreciate Senator KYL's willingness to incorporate my language into the Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act that allows state and local facilities to collect health care copayment fees when housing pre-sentencing federal prisoners. 
   I also worked with Senator KYL to include sufficient flexibility in the Kyl-Johnson bill for the Bureau of Prisons and local facilities contracting with the Marshals Service to maintain preventive-health priorities. The Kyl-Johnson bill prohibits the refusal of treatment for financial reasons or for appropriate preventive care. I am pleased this provision was included to pre-empt long term, and subsequently more costly, health problems among prisoners. 
   The goal of the Kyl-Johnson Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act is not about generating revenue for the federal, state, and local prison systems. Instead, current prisoner health care copayment programs in 34 states illustrate the success in reducing the number of frivolous health visits and strain on valuable health care resources. The Kyl-Johnson bill will ensure that adequate health care is available to those prisoners who need it, without straining the budgets of taxpayers.

    Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today is a great day for South Dakota and the nation as March 15, 1999, marks the  operation of a Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS) site in Clark, South Dakota. This morning, Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater officially ``flipped the switch'' on the Clark site, which activated the Coast Guard's expansion of its maritime global positioning system into the NDGPS. The Clark site, along with one in Whitney, Nebraska, will provide South Dakota with complete NDGPS service at no fee. 
   It is not often that a Senator from South Dakota has the opportunity to work with the Coast Guard on a project that benefits the people of my state. About two years ago, Rudy Persaud with South Dakota Department of Transportation contacted me about a technology that was developed to find ships out at sea. Rudy, along with a number of community development districts in my state, convinced me that this same technology could have enormous benefits on the prairies of South Dakota. In fact, the benefit to cost ratio for the NDGPS system is an astounding 150 to 1, with future uses for the technology appearing almost limitless. 
   Working with the development districts, the South Dakota Department of Transportation's goal was to map every mile of every road in the state of South Dakota to give the state and local governments the ability to develop their communities and allocate important highway funds. 
   I was pleased to introduce legislation in 1997 to expand the Coast Guard DGPS into a nationwide system. With the help of Senator DASCHLE, the legislation was added to the Department of Transportation's annual appropriations bill. 
   Throughout the process of securing funding for NDGPS, I have become aware of the numerous benefits NDGPS has for rural states like South Dakota. Four nonprofit planning districts in South Dakota currently use the technology for mapping roads. In some counties, NDGPS will be integrated with E-911 systems to provide accurate addresses for rural households. 
   NDGPS will allow hospital helicopters to electronically locate accident sites. The need for such technology was evident two winters ago when a Webster woman became stranded in her car in the middle of a blizzard. Running low on gas, and with the temperature around -50 degrees, it took rescue crews several hours to find her and take her to safety. 
   The US Geological Survey will also map potential flood areas in the state, potentially saving lives and millions of dollars in property. Considering the farms and communities already inundated with flooding from the past two years, I am pleased this technology will allow South Dakotans to take a proactive approach to identifying potential flood areas. 
   The Mid-Dakota Rural Water System is using NDGPS to locate PVC pipeline for its system that will provide clean drinking water to over 30,000 South Dakotans who currently rely on wells or municipal water trucked to their home. 
   One of the most promising benefits of NDGPS technology will probably come in agriculture, South Dakota's number one industry. I look forward to working with agriculture leaders in South Dakota to promote and support this technology in a way that makes NDGPS an affordable and accessible tool. NDGPS, used in precision farming, may save $5 to 14 per acre by showing farmers exactly how best to apply fertilizer and chemical inputs on their land, so as to treat the land well for future generations while cutting costs now. NDGPS-based field mapping helps determine more accurate yields and makes it easier to more accurately utilize fertilizers, chemicals, and crop inputs. This technology can also be used by farmers to keep better crop production records. For example, this technology makes it possible for a properly equipped spray rig to switch chemicals or rates of application to address a specific weed problem in a specific section of the field. 
   As of today, March 15, 1999, the NDGPS technology is available in every community in South Dakota. I want to commend Rudy Persaud and the many others involved with NDGPS for their dedication and hard work and look forward to working with them on future uses of this incredible technology.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, in expressing support for the underlying Ed-Flex legislation that we are taking up today. This legislation recognizes that the final thought in how to prioritize educational needs in our school districts and our States does not reside exclusively here in Washington. It will commit to a level of innovation that I think is needed in the 50 States, and with the proper accountability, provide for many different strategies designed to improve student achievement all across this country. 
   However, I think Congress would be remiss if it stopped there. I think there are a number of very constructive amendments being offered relative to this legislation, not least of which is the afterschool program amendment being offered by the Senator from California, Senator BOXER, to provide for what I believe is a commonsense kind of Federal, State and local partnership, to provide for an enhanced ability to deal with afterschool programs for children K through 12. 
   This is not a new idea and it is not the province of either particular political party. There has been a tremendous amount of effort through the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program across some 46 States today that have afterschool programs of one kind or another, in 800 different schools, involving some 190,000 students. This amendment would create the kind of partnership that would not involve Federal bureaucracy or Federal micromanagement, but would provide some additional resources for our States and our schools to expand afterschool efforts to 1.1 million additional students in the United States. 
   Our school budgets are strapped. Property taxes that fund school districts in many of our States are already too high. 
   It is apparent to anyone who has had any discussions with school leaders and community leaders and child advocacy leaders that they simply cannot go it alone, that this kind of effort requires a new form of partnership. 
   Not least of all, one of the great gains that we have already seen demonstrated by effective afterschool programs in this country has been a significant reduction in juvenile crime. At a time when we see crime rates going down nationally but yet crime rates among children, among young juveniles, in too many instances going up, there is a need for an additional strategy, an additional partnership to address that crisis. 
   Every study we have presented to the Senate indicates that most juvenile crime occurs between 3 o'clock in the afternoon and dinnertime. That is when experimentation with drugs, with alcohol, with sexual activity, and with gang participation most often occur, it is when it is initiated, and it is the  time when we most need this kind of partnership not just with our schools but with other community organizations and civic organizations to provide alternative kinds of activities for young people. 
   The studies have already shown that to the degree we have these effective programs in place, they have cut juvenile crime by anywhere from 40 to 70 percent. That is why we have such broad-based support from national law enforcement and police groups across this country. And it is why we can make a contrast between the modest expenditure required to significantly increase these afterschool programs and the alternative cost of incarceration. The cost of keeping a young person in a juvenile facility and ultimately in a prison equates roughly to the cost of sending them to Harvard for a year. For a much more modest expenditure, we can keep whole communities intact, have the kind of responsible adult supervision, and have the kind of focus in these young people's lives that they so badly need. 
   I have been holding meetings all across my home State of South Dakota, meeting with parents, with teachers, with law enforcement officials, with child care providers, and the need for expanding after school programs is obvious. More and more families are working. Both spouses are in the workplace, neither of them at home, because of the economic necessity of having a two income household. South Dakota has one of the highest ratios of two-spouse incomes in the Nation. More and more single-parent households as well find themselves confronting the latchkey option with their young people in the family. 
   As a consequence of this very apparent reality, South Dakota. Has struck a bipartisan level of cooperation and understanding about the need for these programs. My Governor, Republican Governor William Janklow, has been one of the more forceful advocates of an expanded State-local partnership on afterschool programs. I applaud his leadership on the issue. He has secured the services of Loila Hunking, the state coordinator for child care services and a long-time Democrat activist, to head up his afterschool program. It has been a model in many ways and reflects what States in other parts of the country have been doing to bring both sides together to set aside political polarization and, instead, to focus on what in fact is in the best interest of our kids and our communities. 
   But it is all too apparent--even though we have been building facilities and afterschool program facilities that can be used for afterschool programs, and day-care centers, even though we are scraping to find private funds to match local school funds and State funds--that the resources simply are not there, and all too often the communities where the need is the greatest are the communities that have the least financial capability of providing for these kinds of programs. 
   So, again, if we can come up with this amendment to authorize adequate funding for an afterschool program, we will, make a long stride forward not only to anticrime strategy but a pro-education strategy and one that both political parties can rally around. I think it compliments our Ed-Flex legislation. It compliments everything else that we are doing here on the floor today. 
   I want to again applaud Senator BOXER, Senator KENNEDY, and others who have worked hard to promote this afterschool amendment and the underlying Ed-Flex legislation as well. 
   Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will correct an unintended oversight in the federal administration of Native American housing programs, allowing Indian tribes to once again access Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) for housing development in some of this nation's most under-served communities. Joining me as original cosponsors of this bill are Senators INHOFE, CONRAD, KERRY, DASCHLE, INOUYE, WELLSTONE, SARBANES, KERREY, KENNEDY, DORGAN, REID, BAUCUS, BRYAN and BOXER. 
   In the 104th Congress, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act (NAHASDA) was signed into law, separating Indian housing from public housing and providing block grants to tribes and their tribally designated housing authorities. Prior to passage of NAHASDA, Indian tribes receiving HOME block grant funds were able to use those funds to leverage the Low Income Housing Tax Credits distributed by states on a competitive basis. Unfortunately, unlike HOME funds, block grants to tribes under the new NAHASDA are defined as federal funds and cannot be used for accessing LIHTCs. 
   The fact that tribes cannot use their new block grant funds to access a program (LIHTC) which they formerly could access is an unintended consequence of taking Indian Housing out of Public Housing at HUD and setting up the otherwise productive and much needed NAHASDA system. The legislation I am introducing today is limited in scope and redefines NAHASDA funds, restoring tribal eligibility for the LIHTC by putting NAHASDA funds on the same footing as HOME funds. With this technical correction, there would be no change to the LIHTC programs--tribes would compete for LIHTCs with all other entities at the state level, just as they did prior to NAHASDA. 
   This technical corrections legislation is a minor but much needed fix to a valuable program that will restore equity to housing development across the country. The South Dakota Housing Development Authority has enthusiastically endorsed this legislation out of concern for equitable treatment of every resident of our state and to reinforce the proven success of the LIHTC program for housing development in rural and lower income communities. 
   I have joined many of my colleagues in past efforts to preserve and increase the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program which benefits every state, and I ask my colleagues to recognize the importance of maintaining fairness in access to this program emphasized through this legislation and encourage my colleagues to support passage of this vital legislation.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. Chief Justice, the great question now before the Senate is not whether the rule of law will prevail--it surely will--both by the actions of this body and by possible proceedings within the judicial system. 
   The question before the Senate is whether we should take action against the President beyond that allowed for in our nation's courts. We are, I believe, confronted by two threshold questions which must first be resolved before consideration can or need be given to weighing the evidence presented by the House Managers. First, is whether the Articles of Impeachment have been adequately drawn to allow the accused to know with precision the wrong-doing to which he is accused, and to require that a 2/3 majority vote of the Senate be secured upon a single act of wrong-doing in order to convict. As a second threshold matter, if the Articles are at least adequately drawn, do they, if true, allege wrong-doing of sufficient import to justify for the very first time in our nation's long history, the over-turning of the people's will as expressed in a free, fair and democratic national election? I am troubled by the adequacy of the articles, but even accepting them, the second threshold question of impeachability is simply not met. 
   Only if these threshold questions are adequately met in the mind of an individual Senator, can that Senator proceed to determine whether the weight of the evidence is sufficient to convict. And even if both threshold questions are ignored, it is impossible for me to say that the circumstantial evidence presented reaches a ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' standard on either article. Reasonable doubt means that if there are multiple reasonable theories as to what occurred--if one of the reasonable theories is consistent with innocence, then an acquittal must follow. Especially relative to article two--I can understand the belief of some that a plausible scenario of obstruction was established. Some may even believe that the President was more likely than not obstructing justice. But the evidence is clearly not so powerful as to lead anyone to believe that no reasonable and innocent scenario remains. 
   I am both profoundly honored and humbled to have this historic responsibility to participate with my Senate colleagues, Republican and Democrat, in perhaps the most grave proceeding envisioned by the authors of our national Constitution. I have listened carefully to both sides of this dispute, and I have also carefully reviewed the thoughts of many of our nation's leading scholars of history and constitutional law. It is clear to me that the results of this trial have ramifications which go far beyond the fortunes of William Jefferson Clinton. 
   The decision made by the Senate this week will have an utterly profound impact on the relationship between the executive and legislative branches of our government for the rest of time. Accordingly, it is essential that the decisions made in this proceeding not be driven by transitory passions of partisan politics, but rather, with an eye toward the long-term stability and integrity of our democracy. 
   My humble reading of history leads me to believe that the never-failing bipartisan honoring of national presidential elections over these past two centuries has been one of the greatest sources of our national success. While holding a president accountable to all the same civil and criminal laws that apply to the general citizenry is absolutely essential, the writers of our Constitution properly intended for the reversal of fair elections at the hands of Congress to be exceedingly rare and difficult. 
   The learned opinions of our nation's leading scholars overwhelmingly support the understanding that presidents should not be removed from office by Congress short of some horrific personal misconduct or misconduct which arises from executive authority and threatens the nation--such as treason or bribery. By requiring a 2/3 vote for the over-turning of presidential 
   elections, the founders of our nation also made it crystal clear that such an extraordinary step should not and cannot be taken unless there is an overwhelming bipartisan outcry against the President's actions. 
   The American public and most Members of Congress, including myself, have criticized President Clinton's personal conduct in harsh terms. But the American public also seems to understand that at stake is not simply Bill Clinton's future, but the integrity of our election system and the long-term freedom of the executive branch from partisan congressional attack--this understanding about the need for stability, for proportionality, for continuity, is a natural and a deeply conservative inclination on the part of our citizenry. 
   The writers of our Constitution wanted some degree of proportionality between a president's conduct and the penalties applied--otherwise they would have made impeachment applicable to all crimes and misdemeanors. It is certainly conceivable that the will of the people expressed in an election may someday be rightly overturned by Congress. But it is also certain to me that while this president's personal conduct (involving immaterial testimony to a lawsuit dismissed by a federal court as having no merit) is deserving of public condemnation, and even possible prosecution within the judicial system, it simply does not rise to the level of extraordinary danger to the nation that justifies removal from office. 
   Some will no doubt say that I have set a high standard for overturning presidential elections. I would very much agree. Particularly as a recently former member of the House of Representatives, I have witnessed first hand the depth and the intensity of partisan anger that can occur from time to time in Congress and among portions of the national public. It is a reaction to that open partisanship demonstrated by the House and the Independent Counsel that surely is at the foundation of the American public's overwhelming contempt for this proceeding and the view that this process is politics as usual, an exercise in raw political power and beneath what should be the dignity of Congress. 
   I have no certain solutions for that sad and angry state of affairs, other than to attempt to conduct my own political life in as thoughtful and moderate a manner as I am capable, but I believe the Constitution provided our nation with a strong bulwark against negative and hateful partisanship by creating an executive branch which is largely shielded from congressional partisanship and which is instead disciplined by law and by the electoral will of the people. 
   I greatly fear that any lesser standard would result, even without an independent counsel law, in a situation whereby civil actions against standing presidents will be routinely brought as yet another destructive partisan political tactic. These multiple and nefarious actions will then be followed by never-ending legal discovery proceedings, and they in turn followed by impeachment articles or the threat of impeachment each time the House is controlled by a different political party than the Presidency. I fear the wrong decision here will lead our nation into an ever downward spiral where impeachment proceedings will be routine. 
   It is critically important, in my view, for this United States Senate to say, Stop!'' Enough!'' We must send an unmistakable message to the House, the nation and the world, that we will not permit the stability and independence of the executive branch of our government to be jeopardized by anything less than heinous crimes or gross threats to the nation. 
   This leaves, of course, other avenues for Congress and the public to express great displeasure with the President's dishonorable conduct. If illegal activity did in fact take place, that activity would be subject to discipline in the courts. While there are divided opinions on its wisdom, it is possible that  some sort of collective censure may be agreed upon by the Senate, and certainly individual Senators are free to place their condemnations of the President's personal behavior in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. The House impeachment of the President, the public humiliation of Bill 
   Clinton and his family, as well as the great private fortune this dispute will have consumed will also serve as punishment enough. But, I think it is also important for this Senate to understand that the writers of our Constitution did not create an impeachment process as one more form of punishment, but exclusively to protect the viability of our nation. 
   Given my sacred oaths as a United States Senator and as a participant in this impeachment trial, and given my abiding commitment to the Constitution and the well-being of our nation, I have no choice but to vote against both Articles of Impeachment. I do not know nor do I care what the political consequences might be of the decision I make here--I am a Democrat elected six consecutive times state-wide from my largely Republican state, and I have long been proud of the bipartisan support extended to me by the good people of South Dakota. In turn, I have long recognized that neither political party has a monopoly on good ideas or bad, good people or bad. But I know this--the issue before me is too grave for politics. At the end of the day, when my service in this body is done, I want my children, my family and myself to view my decisions here as honorable, as an exercise in responsible judgement, and in a small way, as efforts that strengthened the bulwark of democracy that our Constitution represents. 
   The President dishonorably lied to the American people, however, the two Articles before the Senate fail, first because they do not allege offenses that give rise to removal from office, and secondly, because it cannot be said that the evidence proves guilt of perjury or obstruction of justice beyond all reasonable doubt (to such a degree that no innocent and reasonable explanation exists). 
   I will vote not guilty on both Article one and Article two.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce legislation to authorize a critically important rural water system in South Dakota, the ``Perkins County Rural Water System Act of 1999.'' I am pleased to have my good friend and colleague from South Dakota, Senator DASCHLE, as an original cosponsor of this important legislation, which we introduced during the 105th. This legislation is also strongly supported by the State of South Dakota and local project sponsors, who have demonstrated that support by agreeing to substantial financial contributions from the local level. 
   During the 105th Congress the Perkins County Rural Water System Act was passed by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, as well as the full Senate. Unfortunately, this legislation was caught up in part of a larger legislative package, but I am hopeful the Senate will again support this important drinking water project and pass this legislation early this year. 
   Like many parts of South Dakota, Perkins County has insufficient water supplies of reasonable quality available, and the water supplies that are available do not meet the minimum health and safety standards, thereby posing a threat to public health and safety. 
   In addition to improving the health of residents in the region, I strongly believe that this rural drinking water delivery project will help to stabilize the rural economy as well. Water is a basic commodity and is essential if we are to foster rural development in many parts of rural South Dakota, including the Perkins County area. 
   The ``Perkins County Rural Water System Act of 1999'' authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to construct a Perkins County Rural Water System providing service to approximately 2,500 people, including the communities of Lemmon and Bison, as well as rural residents. The Perkins County Rural Water System is located in northwestern South Dakota along the South Dakota/North Dakota border and it will be an extension of an existing rural water system in North Dakota, the Southwest Pipeline Project. The State of South Dakota has worked closely with the State of North Dakota over the years on the Perkins County connection to the Southwest Pipeline Project. A feasibility study completed in 1994 looked at several alternatives for a dependable water supply, and the connection to the Southwest Pipeline Project is clearly the most feasible for the Perkins County area. 
   Mr. President, South Dakota is plagued by water of exceeding poor quality, and the Perkins County rural water project is an effort to help provide clean water--a commodity most of us take for granted--to the people of Perkins County, South Dakota. I am a strong believer in the federal government's role in rural water delivery, and I hope to continue to advance that agenda both in South Dakota and around the country. I urge my colleagues to support this important rural water legislation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to move forward on enactment as quickly as possible.

   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President. Today, I am proud to be introducing legislation, along with my colleagues, the Minority Leader Senator DASCHLE of South Dakota, Senator HARKIN and Senator GRASSLEY of Iowa, and Senator WELLSTONE and Senator GRAMS of Minnesota, to authorize the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System. We introduced similar legislation last Congress, and I am pleased with the progress we made in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The Committee held a hearing and passed the legislation during the 105th Congress, and I look forward to again working closely with my colleagues for timely consideration of this important measure. 
   The Lewis and Clark Rural Water system is made up of 22 rural water systems and communities in southeastern South Dakota, northwestern Iowa and southwestern Minnesota who have joined together in an effort to cooperatively address the dual problems facing the delivery of drinking water in this region--inadequate quantities of water and poor quality water. 
   The region has seen substantial growth and development in recent years, and studies have shown that future water needs will be significantly greater than the current available supply. Most of the people who are served by ten of the water utilities in the proposed Lewis and Clark project area currently enforce water restrictions on a seasonal basis. Almost half of the membership has water of such poor quality it does not meet present or proposed standards for drinking water. More than two-thirds rely on shallow aquifers as their primary source of drinking water, aquifers which are very vulnerable to contamination by surface activities. 
   The Lewis and Clark system will be a supplemental supply of drinking water for its 22 members, acting as a treated, bulk delivery system. The distribution to deliver water to individual users will continue through the existing systems used by each member utility. This ``regionalization approach'' to solving these water supply and quality problems enables the Missouri River to provide a source of clean, safe drinking water to more than 180,000 individuals. A source of water which none of the members of Lewis and Clark could afford on their own. 
   The proposed system would help to stabilize the regional rural economy by providing water to Sioux Falls, the hub city in the region, as well as numerous small communities and individual farms in South Dakota and portions of Iowa and Minnesota. 
   The States of South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota have all authorized the project and local sponsors have demonstrated a financial commitment to this project through state grants, local water development district grants and membership dues. The State of South Dakota has already contributed more than $400,000. 
   Mr. President, I do not believe our needs get any more basic than good quality, reliable drinking water, and I appreciate the fact that Congress has shown support for efforts to improve drinking water supplies in South Dakota. I look forward to continue working with my colleagues to have that support extended to the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System
