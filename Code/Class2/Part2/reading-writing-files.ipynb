    "### Raw Strings\n",
    "In Python, we use `r` before the beginning quotation mark of a string -- single or double quote -- to declare a raw string. A raw string ignores all escape characters it might encounter and prints them. Python considers the backslash as part of the string and not as the start of an escape character. Raw strings are helpful if you are typing string values that contain many backslashes, such as the strings used for regular expressions (which we will cover in our next meeting).\n"

Magazine.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology and pronunciation ==\\nThe previously separate towns of Buda, Óbuda, and Pest were in 1873 officially unified and given the new name Budapest. Before this, the towns together had sometimes been referred to colloquially as \"Pest-Buda\". Pest has also been sometimes used colloquially as a shortened name for Budapest.All varieties of English pronounce the -s- as in the English word pest. The -u in Buda- is pronounced either /u/ like food (as in US: ) or /ju/ like cue (as in UK: ). In Hungarian, the -s- is pronounced /ʃ/ as in wash; in IPA: Hungarian: [ˈbudɒpɛʃt] (listen).\\nThe origin of the names \"Buda\" and \"Pest\" is obscure. Buda was\\n\\nprobably the name of the first constable of the fortress built on the Castle Hill in the 11th century\\nor a derivative of Bod or Bud, a personal name of Turkic origin, meaning \\'twig\\'.\\nor a Slavic personal name, Buda, the short form of Budimír, Budivoj.Linguistically, however, a German origin through the Slavic derivative вода (voda, water) is not possible, and there is no certainty that a Turkic word really comes from the word buta ~ buda \\'branch, twig\\'.According to a legend recorded in chronicles from the Middle Ages, \"Buda\" comes from the name of its founder, Bleda, brother of Hunnic ruler Attila.\\nThere are several theories about Pest. One states that the name derives from Roman times, since there was a local fortress (Contra-Aquincum) called by Ptolemaios \"Pession\" (\"Πέσσιον\", iii.7.§ 2). Another has it that Pest originates in the Slavic word for cave, пещера, or peštera. A third cites пещ, or pešt, referencing a cave where fires burned or a limekiln.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early history ===\\n\\nThe first settlement on the territory of Budapest was built by Celts before 1 AD. It was later occupied by the Romans. The Roman settlement – Aquincum – became the main city of Pannonia Inferior in 106 AD. At first it was a military settlement, and gradually the city rose around it, making it the focal point of the city\\'s commercial life. Today this area corresponds to the Óbuda district within Budapest. The Romans constructed roads, amphitheaters, baths and houses with heated floors in this fortified military camp. The Roman city of Aquincum is the best-conserved of the Roman sites in Hungary. The archaeological site was turned into a museum with inside and open-air sections.The Magyar tribes led by Árpád, forced out of their original homeland north of Bulgaria by Tsar Simeon after the Battle of Southern Buh, settled in the territory at the end of the 9th century displacing the founding Bulgarian settlers of the towns of Buda and Pest, and a century later officially founded the Kingdom of Hungary. Research places the probable residence of the Árpáds as an early place of central power near what became Budapest. The Tatar invasion in the 13th century quickly proved it is difficult to defend a plain. King Béla IV of Hungary therefore ordered the construction of reinforced stone walls around the towns and set his own royal palace on the top of the protecting hills of Buda. In 1361 it became the capital of Hungary.The cultural role of Buda was particularly significant during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus. The Italian Renaissance had a great influence on the city. His library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was Europe\\'s greatest collection of historical chronicles and philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century, and second in size only to the Vatican Library. After the foundation of the first Hungarian university in Pécs in 1367 (University of Pécs), the second one was established in Óbuda in 1395 (University of Óbuda). The first Hungarian book was printed in Buda in 1473. Buda had about 5,000 inhabitants around 1500.\\n\\nThe Ottomans conquered Buda in 1526, as well in 1529, and finally occupied it in 1541. The Turkish Rule lasted for more than 150 years. The Ottoman Turks constructed many prominent bathing facilities within the city. Some of the baths that the Turks erected during their rule are still in use 500 years later (Rudas Baths and Király Baths). By 1547 the number of Christians was down to about a thousand, and by 1647 it had fallen to only about seventy. The unoccupied western part of the country became part of the Habsburg Monarchy as Royal Hungary.\\nIn 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed campaign was started to enter the Hungarian capital. This time, the Holy League\\'s army was twice as large, containing over 74,000 men, including German, Croat, Dutch, Hungarian, English, Spanish, Czech, Italian, French, Burgundian, Danish and Swedish soldiers, along with other Europeans as volunteers, artillerymen, and officers. The Christian forces seized Buda, and in the next few years, all of the former Hungarian lands, except areas near Temesvár (Timișoara), were taken from the Turks. In the 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz, these territorial changes were officially recognized to show the end of the rule of the Turks, and in 1718 the entire Kingdom of Hungary was removed from Ottoman rule.\\n\\n\\n=== Contemporary history after Unification ===\\n\\nThe 19th century was dominated by the Hungarian struggle for independence and modernisation. The national insurrection against the Habsburgs began in the Hungarian capital in 1848 and was defeated one and a half years later, with the help of the Russian Empire. 1867 was the year of Reconciliation that brought about the birth of Austria-Hungary. This made Budapest the twin capital of a dual monarchy. It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the history of Budapest, lasting until World War I. In 1849 the Chain Bridge linking Buda with Pest was opened as the first permanent bridge across the Danube and in 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with the third part, Óbuda (Old Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into the country\\'s administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Ethnic Hungarians overtook Germans in the second half of the 19th century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural Transdanubia and Great Hungarian Plain. Between 1851 and 1910 the proportion of Hungarians increased from 35.6% to 85.9%, Hungarian became the dominant language, and German was crowded out. The proportion of Jews peaked in 1900 with 23.6%. Due to the prosperity and the large Jewish community of the city at the start of the 20th century, Budapest was often called the \"Jewish Mecca\" or \"Judapest\".\\nIn 1918, Austria-Hungary lost the war and collapsed; Hungary declared itself an independent republic (Republic of Hungary). In 1920 the Treaty of Trianon partitioned the country, and as a result, Hungary lost over two-thirds of its territory, and about two-thirds of its inhabitants, including 3.3 million out of 15 million ethnic Hungarians.\\n\\nIn 1944, a year before the end of World War II, Budapest was partly destroyed by British and American air raids (first attack 4 April 1944).\\nFrom 24 December 1944 to 13 February 1945, the city was besieged during the Battle of Budapest. Budapest suffered major damage caused by the attacking Soviet and Romanian troops and the defending German and Hungarian troops. More than 38,000 civilians lost their lives during the conflict. All bridges were destroyed by the Germans. The stone lions that have decorated the Chain Bridge since 1852 survived the devastation of the war.Between 20% and 40% of Greater Budapest\\'s 250,000 Jewish inhabitants died through Nazi and Arrow Cross Party, during the German occupation of Hungary, from 1944 to early 1945.Swiss diplomat Carl Lutz rescued tens of thousands of Jews by issuing Swiss protection papers and designating numerous buildings, including the now famous Glass House (Üvegház) at Vadász Street 29, to be Swiss protected territory. About 3,000 Hungarian Jews found refuge at the Glass House and in a neighboring building. Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg saved the lives of tens of thousands of Jews in Budapest by giving them Swedish protection papers and taking them under his consular protection. Wallenberg was abducted by the Russians on 17 January 1945 and never regained freedom. Giorgio Perlasca, an Italian citizen, saved thousands of Hungarian Jews posing as a Spanish diplomat. Some other diplomats also abandoned diplomatic protocol and rescued Jews. There are two monuments for Wallenberg, one for Carl Lutz and one for Giorgio Perlasca in Budapest.\\nFollowing the liberation of Hungary from Nazi Germany by the Red Army, Soviet military occupation ensued, which ended only in 1991. The Soviets exerted significant influence on Hungarian political affairs. In 1949, Hungary was declared a communist People\\'s Republic (People\\'s Republic of Hungary). The new Communist government considered the buildings like the Buda Castle symbols of the former regime, and during the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the interiors were destroyed (also see Stalin era).\\nOn 23 October 1956 citizens held a large peaceful demonstration in Budapest demanding democratic reform. The demonstrators went to the Budapest radio station and demanded to publish their demands. The regime ordered troops to shoot into the crowd. Hungarian soldiers gave rifles to the demonstrators who were now able to capture the building. This initiated the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The demonstrators demanded to appoint Imre Nagy to be Prime Minister of Hungary. To their surprise, the central committee of the \"Hungarian Working People\\'s Party\" did so that same evening. This uprising was an anti-Soviet revolt that lasted from 23 October until 11 November. After Nagy had declared that Hungary was to leave the Warsaw Pact and become neutral, Soviet tanks and troops entered the country to crush the revolt. Fighting continued until mid November, leaving more than 3000 dead. A monument was erected at the fiftieth anniversary of the revolt in 2006, at the edge of the City Park. Its shape is a wedge with a 56 angle degree made in rusted iron that gradually becomes shiny, ending in an intersection to symbolize Hungarian forces that temporarily eradicated the Communist leadership.From the 1960s to the late 1980s Hungary was often satirically referred to as \"the happiest barrack\" within the Eastern bloc, and much of the wartime damage to the city was finally repaired. Work on Erzsébet Bridge, the last to be rebuilt, was finished in 1964. In the early 1970s, Budapest Metro\\'s east–west M2 line was first opened, followed by the M3 line in 1976. In 1987, Buda Castle and the banks of the Danube were included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. Andrássy Avenue (including the Millennium Underground Railway, Hősök tere, and Városliget) was added to the UNESCO list in 2002. In the 1980s, the city\\'s population reached 2.1 million. In recent times a significant decrease in population occurred mainly due to a massive movement to the neighbouring agglomeration in Pest county, i.e., suburbanisation.In the last decades of the 20th century the political changes of 1989–90 (Fall of the Iron Curtain) concealed changes in civil society and along the streets of Budapest. The monuments of the dictatorship were removed from public places, into Memento Park. In the first 20 years of the new democracy, the development of the city was managed by its mayor, Gábor Demszky.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Topography ===\\n\\nBudapest, strategically placed at the centre of the Carpathian Basin, lies on an ancient route linking the hills of Transdanubia with the Great Plain.  By road it is 216 kilometres (134 mi) south-east of Vienna, 545 kilometres (339 mi) south of Warsaw, 1,565 kilometres (972 mi) south-west of Moscow, 1,122 kilometres (697 mi) north of Athens, 788 kilometres (490 mi) north-east of Milan, and 443 kilometres (275 mi) south-east of Prague.The 525 square kilometres (203 sq mi) area of Budapest lies in Central Hungary, surrounded by settlements of the agglomeration in Pest county. The capital extends 25 and 29 km (16 and 18 mi) in the north–south, east–west direction respectively. The Danube enters the city from the north; later it encircles two islands, Óbuda Island and Margaret Island. The third island Csepel Island is the largest of the Budapest Danube islands, however only its northernmost tip is within city limits. The river that separates the two parts of the city is 230 m (755 ft) wide at its narrowest point in Budapest. Pest lies on the flat terrain of the Great Plain while Buda is rather hilly.The wide Danube was always fordable at this point because of a small number of islands in the middle of the river. The city has marked topographical contrasts: Buda is built on the higher river terraces and hills of the western side, while the considerably larger Pest spreads out on a flat and featureless sand plain on the river\\'s opposite bank. Pest\\'s terrain rises with a slight eastward gradient, so the easternmost parts of the city lie at the same altitude as Buda\\'s smallest hills, notably Gellért Hill and Castle Hill.The Buda hills consist mainly of limestone and dolomite, the water created speleothems, the most famous ones being the Pálvölgyi cave (total length 7,200 m or 23,600 ft) and the Szemlőhegyi cave (total length 2,200 m or 7,200 ft). The hills were formed in the Triassic Period. The highest point of the hills and of Budapest is János Hill, at 527 metres (1,729 feet) above sea level. The lowest point is the line of the Danube which is 96 metres (315 feet) above sea level.  Budapest is also rich in green areas. Of the 525 square kilometres (203 square miles) occupied by the city, 83 square kilometres (32 square miles) is green area, park and forest. The forests of Buda hills are environmentally protected.The city\\'s importance in terms of traffic is very central, because many major European roads and European railway lines lead to Budapest. The Danube was and is still an important water-way and this region in the centre of the Carpathian Basin lies at the cross-roads of trade routes.\\nBudapest is one of only three capital cities in the world which has thermal springs (the other being Reykjavík in Iceland and Sofia in Bulgaria). Some 125 springs produce 70 million litres (15,000,000 imperial gallons; 18,000,000 US gallons) of thermal water a day, with temperatures ranging up to 58 Celsius. Some of these waters have medicinal effects due to their medically valuable mineral contents.\\n\\n\\n=== Climate ===\\n\\nBudapest has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa in Köppen climate classification), with relatively cold winters (near of a humid continental climate when the 0 °C isotherm is used) and warm summers (near of an oceanic climate) according to the 1971–2000 climatological norm. Winter (November until early March) can be cold and the city receives little sunshine. Snowfall is fairly frequent in most years, and nighttime temperatures of −10 °C (14 °F) are not uncommon between mid-December and mid-February. The spring months (March and April) see variable conditions, with a rapid increase in the average temperature. The weather in late March and in April is often very agreeable during the day and fresh at night. Budapest\\'s long summer – lasting from May until mid-September – is warm or very warm. Sudden heavy showers also occur, particularly in May and June. The autumn in Budapest (mid-September until late October) is characterised by little rain and long sunny days with moderate temperatures. Temperatures often turn abruptly colder in late October or early November.\\nMean annual precipitation in Budapest is around 23.5 inches (596.9 mm). On average, there are 84 days with precipitation and 1988 hours of sunshine (of a possible 4383) each year. From March to October, average sunshine totals are roughly equal to those seen in northern Italy (Venice).\\nThe city lies on the boundary between Zone 6 and Zone 7 in terms of the hardiness zone.\\n\\n\\n== Architecture ==\\n\\nBudapest has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the ancient times as Roman City of Aquincum in Óbuda (District III), which dates to around 89 AD, to the most modern Palace of Arts, the contemporary arts museum and concert hall.Most buildings in Budapest are relatively low: in the early 2010s there were around 100 buildings higher than 45 metres (148 ft). The number of high-rise buildings is kept low by building legislation, which is aimed at preserving the historic cityscape and to meet the requirements of the World Heritage Site. Strong rules apply to the planning, authorisation and construction of high-rise buildings and consequently much of the inner city does not have any. Some planners would like see an easing of the rules for the construction of skyscrapers, and the possibility of building skyscrapers outside the city\\'s historic core has been raised.In the chronological order of architectural styles Budapest represents on the entire timeline. Start with the Roman City of Aquincum represents the ancient architecture.\\nThe next determinative style is the Gothic architecture in Budapest. The few remaining Gothic buildings can be found in the Castle District. Buildings of note are no. 18, 20 and 22 on Országház Street, which date back to the 14th century and No. 31 Úri Street, which has a Gothic façade that dates back to the 15th century. Another buildings with Gothic remains is the Inner City Parish Church, built in the 12th century, and the Mary Magdalene Church, completed in the 15th century. The most characteristic Gothic-style buildings are actually Neo-Gothic, like the most well-known Budapest landmarks, the Hungarian Parliament Building and the Matthias Church, where much of the original material was used (originally built in Romanesque style in 1015).The next chapter in the history of human architecture is Renaissance architecture. One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was Hungary, and Budapest in particular. The style appeared following the marriage of King Matthias Corvinus and Beatrice of Naples in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and masons came to Buda with the new queen. Today, many of the original renaissance buildings disappeared during the varied history of Buda, but Budapest is still rich in renaissance and neo-renaissance buildings, like the famous Hungarian State Opera House, St. Stephen\\'s Basilica and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\\n\\nDuring the Turkish occupation (1541–1686), Islamic culture flourished in Budapest; multiple mosques and baths were built in the city. These were great examples of Ottoman architecture, which was influenced by Muslims from around the world including Turkish, Iranian, Arabian and to a larger extent, Byzantine architecture as well as Islamic traditions. After the Holy League conquered Budapest, they replaced most of the mosques with churches and minarets were turned into bell towers and cathedral spires. At one point the distinct sloping central square in Budapest became a bustling Oriental bazaar, which was filled with \"the chatter of camel caravans on their way to Yemen and India\". Budapest is in fact one of the few places in the world with functioning original Turkish bathhouses dating back to the 16th century, like Rudas Baths or Király Baths. Budapest is home to the northernmost place where the tomb of influential Islamic Turkish Sufi Dervish, Gül Baba is found. Various cultures converged in Hungary seemed to coalesce well with each other, as if all these different cultures and architecture styles are digested into Hungary\\'s own way of cultural blend. A precedent to show the city\\'s self-conscious is the top section of the city\\'s main square, named as Szechenyi. When Turks came to the city, they built mosques here which was aggressively replaced with Gothic church of St. Bertalan. The rationale of reusing the base of the former Islamic building mosque and reconstruction into Gothic Church but Islamic style architecture over it is typically Islamic are still visible. An official term for the rationale is spolia. The mosque was called the djami of Pasha Gazi Kassim, and djami means mosque in Arabic. After Turks and Muslims were expelled and massacred from Budapest, the site was reoccupied by Christians and reformed into a church, the Inner City Parish Church (Budapest). The minaret and Turkish entranceway were removed. The shape of the architecture is its only hint of exotic past—\"two surviving prayer niches facing Mecca and an ecumenical symbol atop its cupola: a cross rising above the Turkish crescent moon\".\\n\\nAfter 1686, the Baroque architecture designated the dominant style of art in catholic countries from the 17th century to the 18th century. There are many Baroque-style buildings in Budapest and one of the finest examples of preserved Baroque-style architecture is the Church of St. Anna in Batthyhány square. An interesting part of Budapest is the less touristy Óbuda, the main square of which also has some beautiful preserved historic buildings with Baroque façades. The Castle District is another place to visit where the best-known landmark Buda Royal Palace and many other buildings were built in the Baroque style.The Classical architecture and Neoclassical architecture are the next in the timeline. Budapest had not one but two architects that were masters of the Classicist style. Mihály Pollack (1773–1855) and József Hild (1789–1867), built many beautiful Classicist-style buildings in the city. Some of the best examples are the Hungarian National Museum, the Lutheran Church of Budavár (both designed by Pollack) and the seat of the Hungarian president, the Sándor Palace. The most iconic and widely known Classicist-style attraction in Budapest is the Széchenyi Chain Bridge. Budapest\\'s two most beautiful Romantic architecture buildings are the Great Synagogue in Dohány Street and the Vigadó Concert Hall on the Danube Promenade, both designed by architect Frigyes Feszl (1821–1884). Another noteworthy structure is the Budapest Western Railway Station, which was designed by August de Serres and built by the Eiffel Company of Paris in 1877.\\n\\nArt Nouveau came into fashion in Budapest by the exhibitions which were held in and around 1896 and organised in connection with the Hungarian Millennium celebrations. Art Nouveau in Hungary (Szecesszió in Hungarian) is a blend of several architectural styles, with a focus on Hungary\\'s specialities. One of the leading Art Nouveau architects, Ödön Lechner (1845–1914), was inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture as well as traditional Hungarian decorative designs. One of his most beautiful buildings in Budapest is the Museum of Applied Arts. Another examples for Art Nouveau in Budapest is the Gresham Palace in front of the Chain Bridge, the Hotel Gellért, the Franz Liszt Academy of Music or Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden.The second half of the 20th century also saw, under the communist regime, the construction of blocks of flats (panelház), as in other Eastern European countries. In the 21st century, Budapest faces new challenges in its architecture. The pressure towards the high-rise buildings is unequivocal among today\\'s world cities, but preserving Budapest\\'s unique cityscape and its very diverse architecture, along with green areas, is force Budapest to balance between them. The Contemporary architecture has wide margin in the city. Public spaces attract heavy investment by business and government also, so that the city has gained entirely new (or renovated and redesigned) squares, parks and monuments, for example the city central Kossuth Lajos square, Deák Ferenc square and Liberty Square. Budapest\\'s urban landscape is one of the modern and contemporary architecture. Numerous landmarks are created in the last decade in Budapest, like the National Theatre, Palace of Arts, Rákóczi Bridge, Megyeri Bridge, Budapest Airport Sky Court among others, and millions of square meters of new office buildings and apartments. But there are still large opportunities in real estate development in the city.\\n\\n\\n== Districts ==\\n\\nMost of today\\'s Budapest is the result of a late-nineteenth-century renovation, but the wide boulevards laid out then only bordered and bisected much older quarters of activity created by centuries of Budapest\\'s city evolution.\\nBudapest\\'s vast urban area is often described using a set of district names. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units of former boroughs.\\nSuch names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries.\\nOriginally Budapest had 10 districts after coming into existence upon the unification of the three cities in 1873. Since 1950, Greater Budapest has been divided into 22 boroughs (and 23 since 1994). At that time there were changes both in the order of districts and in their sizes. The city now consists of 23 districts, 6 in Buda, 16 in Pest and 1 on Csepel Island between them.\\nThe city centre itself in a broader sense comprises the District V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and XIII on the Pest side, and the I, II, XI and XII on the Buda side of the city.District I is a small area in central Buda, including the historic Buda Castle. District II is in Buda again, in the northwest, and District III stretches along in the northernmost part of Buda. To reach District IV, one must cross the Danube to find it in Pest (the eastern side), also at north. With District V, another circle begins, it is located in the absolute centre of Pest. Districts VI, VII, VIII and IX are the neighbouring areas to the east, going southwards, one after the other.\\nDistrict X is another, more external circle also in Pest, while one must jump to the Buda side again to find Districts XI and XII, going northwards. No more districts remaining in Buda in this circle, we must turn our steps to Pest again to find Districts XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX and XX (mostly external city parts), almost regularly in a semicircle, going southwards again.\\nDistrict XXI is the extension of the above route over a branch of the Danube, the northern tip of a long island south from Budapest. District XXII is still on the same route in southwest Buda, and finally District XXIII is again in southernmost Pest, irregular only because it was part of District XX until 1994.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\nBudapest is the most populous city in Hungary and one of the largest cities in the European Union, with a growing number of inhabitants, estimated at 1,763,913 in 2019, whereby inward migration exceeds outward migration. These trends are also seen throughout the Budapest metropolitan area, which is home to 3.3 million people. This amounts to about 34% of Hungary\\'s population.\\nIn 2014, the city had a population density of 3,314 people per square kilometre (8,580/sq mi), rendering it the most densely populated of all municipalities in Hungary. The population density of Elisabethtown-District VII is 30,989/km2 (80,260/sq mi), which is the highest population density figure in Hungary and one of the highest in the world, for comparison the density in Manhattan is 25,846/km2.Budapest is the fourth most \"dynamically growing city\" by population in Europe, and the Euromonitor predicts a population increase of almost 10% between 2005 and 2030. The European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion says Budapest\\'s population will increase by 10% to 30% only due to migration by 2050. A constant inflow of migrants in recent years has fuelled population growth in Budapest. Productivity gains and the relatively large economically active share of the population explain why household incomes have increased in Budapest to a greater extent than in other parts of Hungary. Higher incomes in Budapest are reflected in the lower share of expenditure the city\\'s inhabitants allocate to necessity spending such as food and non-alcoholic drinks.At the 2016 microcensus, there were 1,764,263 people with 907,944 dwellings living in Budapest. Some 1.6 million persons from the metropolitan area may be within Budapest\\'s boundaries during work hours, and during special events. This fluctuation of people is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.By ethnicity there were 1,697,039 (96.2%) Hungarians, 34,909 (2%) Germans, 16,592 (0.9%) Romani, 9,117 (0.5%) Romanians and 5,488 (0.3%) Slovaks. In Hungary people can declare multiple ethnic identities, hence the sum may exceed 100%. The share of ethnic Hungarians in Budapest (96.2%) is slighly lower than the national average (98.3%) due to the international migration.According to the 2011 census, 1,712,153 people (99.0%) speak Hungarian, of whom 1,692,815 people (97.9%) speak it as a first language, while 19,338 people (1.1%) speak it as a second language. Other spoken (foreign) languages were: English (536,855 speakers, 31.0%), German (266,249 speakers, 15.4%), French (56,208 speakers, 3.3%) and Russian (54,613 speakers, 3.2%).According to the same census, 1,600,585 people (92.6%) were born in Hungary, 126,036 people (7.3%) outside Hungary while the birthplace of 2,419 people (0.1%) was unknown.\\nAlthough only 1.7% of the population of Hungary in 2009 were foreigners, 43% of them lived in Budapest, making them 4.4% of the city\\'s population (up from 2% in 2001). Nearly two-thirds of foreigners living in Hungary were under 40 years old. The primary motivation for this age group living in Hungary was employment.Budapest is home to one of the most populous Christian communities in Central Europe, numbering 698,521 people (40.4%) in 2011. According to the 2011 census, there were 501,117 (29.0%) Roman Catholics, 146,756 (8.5%) Calvinists, 30,293 (1.8%) Lutherans, 16,192 (0.9%) Greek Catholics, 7,925 (0.5%) Jews and 3,710 (0.2%) Orthodox in Budapest. 395,964 people (22.9%) were irreligious while 585,475 people (33.9%) did not declare their religion. The city is also home to one of the largest Jewish communities in Europe.\\n\\n\\n== Economy ==\\n\\nBudapest is a significant economic hub, classified as an Beta + world city in the study by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network and it is the second fastest-developing urban economy in Europe as GDP per capita in the city increased by 2.4 per cent and employment by 4.7 per cent compared to the previous year in 2014.\\nOn national level, Budapest is the primate city of Hungary regarding business and economy, accounting for 39% of the national income, the city has a gross metropolitan product more than $100 billion in 2015, making it one of the largest regional economy in the European Union.\\nAccording to the Eurostat GDP per capita in purchasing power parity is 147% of the EU average in Budapest, which means €37,632 ($42,770) per capita.\\nBudapest is also among the Top100 GDP performing cities in the world, measured by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\\nThe city was named as the 52nd most important business centre in the world in the Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index, ahead of Beijing, São Paulo or Shenzhen and ranking 3rd (out of 65 cities) on MasterCard Emerging Markets Index.\\nThe city is 48th on the UBS The most expensive and richest cities in the world list, standing before cities such as Prague, Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur or Buenos Aires.\\nIn a global city competitiveness ranking by EIU, Budapest stands before Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Moscow and Johannesburg among others.The city is a major centre for banking and finance, real estate, retailing, trade, transportation, tourism, new media as well as traditional media, advertising, legal services, accountancy, insurance, fashion and the arts in Hungary and regionally. Budapest is home not only to almost all national institutions and government agencies, but also to many domestic and international companies, in 2014 there are 395.804 companies registered in the city. Most of these entities are headquartered in the Budapest\\'s Central Business District, in the District V and District XIII. The retail market of the city (and the country) is also concentrated in the downtown, among others through the two largest shopping centre in Central and Eastern Europe, the 186,000 sqm WestEnd City Center and the 180,000 sqm Arena Plaza.Budapest has notable innovation capabilities as a technology and start-up hub, many start-ups are headquartered and begin its business in the city, for instance deserve to mention the most well-known Prezi, LogMeIn or NNG. Budapest is the highest ranked Central and Eastern European city on Innovation Cities\\' Top 100 index. A good indicator of the city\\'s potential for innovation and research also, is that the European Institute of Innovation and Technology chose Budapest for its headquarters, along with the UN, which Regional Representation for Central Europe office is in the city, responsible for UN operations in seven countries.\\nMoreover, the global aspect of the city\\'s research activity is shown through the establishment of the European Chinese Research Institute in the city. Other important sectors include also, as natural science research, information technology and medical research, non-profit institutions, and universities. The leading business schools and universities in Budapest, the Budapest Business School, the CEU Business School and Corvinus University of Budapest offers a whole range of courses in economics, finance and management in English, French, German and Hungarian. The unemployment rate is far the lowest in Budapest within Hungary, it was 2.7%, besides the many thousands of employed foreign citizens.Budapest is among the 25 most visited cities in the world, the city welcoming more than 4.4 million international visitors each year, therefore the traditional and the congress tourism industry also deserve a mention, it contributes greatly to the city\\'s economy. The capital being home to many convention centre and thousands of restaurants, bars, coffee houses and party places, besides the full assortment of hotels. In restaurant offerings can be found the highest quality Michelin-starred restaurants, like Onyx, Costes, Tanti or Borkonyha.

The new baths that were constructed during the Turkish period (1541–1686) served both bathing and medicinal purposes, and some of these are still in use to this day.Budapest gained its reputation as a city of spas in the 1920s, following the first realisation of the economic potential of the thermal waters in drawing in visitors. Indeed, in 1934 Budapest was officially ranked as a \"City of Spas\".

The well-preserved Art Nouveau interior includes colourful mosaics, marble columns, stained glass windows and statues.\\nThe Lukács Baths are also in Buda and are also Turkish in origin, although they were only revived at the end of the 19th century. This was also when the spa and treatment centre were founded.

Since the 1950s it has been regarded as a centre for intellectuals and artists.\\nThe Széchenyi Baths are one of the largest bathing complexes in all Europe, and the only \"old\" medicinal baths to be found in the Pest side of the city.

Budapest strategically placed at the centre of the Carpathian Basin lies on an ancient route linking the hills of Transdanubia with the Great Plain By road it is kilometres mi south east of Vienna kilometres mi south of Warsaw kilometres mi south west of Moscow kilometres mi north of Athens kilometres mi north east of Milan and kilometres mi south east of Prague The square kilometres sq mi area of Budapest lies in Central Hungary surrounded by settlements of the agglomeration in Pest county The capital extends and km and mi in the north south east west direction respectively The Danube enters the city from the north later it encircles two islands buda Island and Margaret Island The third island Csepel Island is the largest of the Budapest Danube islands however only its northernmost tip is within city limits The river that separates the two parts of the city is m ft wide at its narrowest point in Budapest Pest lies on the flat terrain of the Great Plain while Buda is rather hilly The wide Danube was always fordable at this point because of a small number of islands in the middle of the river The city has marked topographical contrasts Buda is built on the higher river terraces and hills of the western side while the considerably larger Pest spreads out on a flat and featureless sand plain on the river s opposite bank Pest s terrain rises with a slight eastward gradient so the easternmost parts of the city lie at the same altitude as Buda s smallest hills notably Gell rt Hill and Castle Hill The Buda hills consist mainly of limestone and dolomite the water created speleothems the most famous ones being the P lv lgyi cave total length m or ft and the Szeml hegyi cave total length m or ft The hills were formed in the Triassic Period The highest point of the hills and of Budapest is J nos Hill at metres feet above sea level The lowest point is the line of the Danube which is metres feet above sea level Budapest is also rich in green areas Of the square kilometres square miles occupied by the city square kilometres square miles is green area park and forest The forests of Buda hills are environmentally protected The city s importance in terms of traffic is very central because many major European roads and European railway lines lead to Budapest The Danube was and is still an important water way and this region in the centre of the Carpathian Basin lies at the cross roads of trade routes Budapest is one of only three capital cities in the world which has thermal springs the other being Reykjav k in Iceland and Sofia in Bulgaria Some springs produce million litres imperial gallons US gallons of thermal water a day with temperatures ranging up to Celsius Some of these waters have medicinal effects due to their medically valuable mineral contents Climate Budapest has a humid subtropical climate Cfa in K ppen climate classification with relatively cold winters near of a humid continental climate when the C isotherm is used and warm summers near of an oceanic climate according to the climatological norm Winter November until early March can be cold and the city receives little sunshine Snowfall is fairly frequent in most years and nighttime temperatures of C F are not uncommon between mid December and mid February The spring months March and April see variable conditions with a rapid increase in the average temperature The weather in late March and in April is often very agreeable during the day and fresh at night Budapest s long summer lasting from May until mid September is warm or very warm Sudden heavy showers also occur particularly in May and June The autumn in Budapest mid September until late October is characterised by little rain and long sunny days with moderate temperatures

of a possible each year From March to October average sunshine totals are roughly equal to those seen in northern Italy Venice The city lies on the boundary between Zone and Zone in terms of the hardiness zone Architecture Budapest has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods from the ancient times as Roman City of Aquincum in buda District III which dates to around AD to the most modern Palace of Arts the contemporary arts museum and concert hall Most buildings in Budapest are relatively low in the early s there were around buildings higher than metres ft The number of high rise buildings is kept low by building legislation which is aimed at preserving the historic cityscape and to meet the requirements of the World Heritage Site Strong rules apply to the planning authorisation and construction of high rise buildings and consequently much of the inner city does not have any Some planners would like see an easing of the rules for the construction of skyscrapers and the possibility of building skyscrapers outside the city s historic core has been raised In the chronological order of architectural styles Budapest represents on the entire timeline Start with the Roman City of Aquincum represents the ancient architecture The next determinative style is the Gothic architecture in Budapest The few remaining Gothic buildings can be found in the Castle District Buildings of note are no and on Orsz gh z Street which date back to the th century and No ri Street which has a Gothic fa ade that dates back to the th century Another buildings with Gothic remains is the Inner City Parish Church built in the th century and the Mary Magdalene Church completed in the th century The most characteristic Gothic style buildings are actually Neo Gothic like the most well known Budapest landmarks the Hungarian Parliament Building and the Matthias Church where much of the original material was used originally built in Romanesque style in The next chapter in the history of human architecture is Renaissance architecture One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was Hungary and Budapest in particular The style appeared following the marriage of King Matthias Corvinus and Beatrice of Naples in Many Italian artists craftsmen and masons came to Buda with the new queen Today many of the original renaissance buildings disappeared during the varied history of Buda but Budapest is still rich in renaissance and neo renaissance buildings like the famous Hungarian State Opera House St Stephen s Basilica and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences During the Turkish occupation Islamic culture flourished in Budapest multiple mosques and baths were built in the city These were great examples of Ottoman architecture which was influenced by Muslims from around the world including Turkish Iranian Arabian and to a larger extent Byzantine architecture as well as Islamic traditions After the Holy League conquered Budapest they replaced most of the mosques with churches and minarets were turned into bell towers and cathedral spires At one point the distinct sloping central square in Budapest became a bustling Oriental bazaar which was filled with the chatter of camel caravans on their way to Yemen and India Budapest is in fact one of the few places in the world with functioning original Turkish bathhouses dating back to the th century like Rudas Baths or Kir ly Baths Budapest is home to the northernmost place where the tomb of influential Islamic Turkish Sufi Dervish G l Baba is found Various cultures converged in Hungary seemed to coalesce well with each other as if all these different cultures and architecture styles are digested into Hungary s own way of cultural blend A precedent to show the city s self conscious is the top section of the city s main square named as Szechenyi When Turks came to the city they built mosques here which was aggressively replaced with Gothic church of St Bertalan The rationale of reusing the base of the former Islamic building mosque and reconstruction into Gothic Church but Islamic style architecture over it is typically Islamic are still visible An official term for the rationale is spolia The mosque was called the djami of Pasha Gazi Kassim and djami means mosque in Arabic After Turks and Muslims were expelled and massacred from Budapest the site was reoccupied by Christians and reformed into a church the Inner City Parish Church Budapest The minaret and Turkish entranceway were removed The shape of the architecture is its only hint of exotic past two surviving prayer niches facing Mecca and an ecumenical symbol atop its cupola a cross rising above the Turkish crescent moon After the Baroque architecture designated the dominant style of art in catholic countries from the th century to the th century There are many Baroque style buildings in Budapest and one of the finest examples of preserved Baroque style architecture is the Church of St Anna in Batthyh ny square An interesting part of Budapest is the less touristy buda the main square of which also has some beautiful preserved historic buildings with Baroque fa ades The Castle District is another place to visit where the best known landmark Buda Royal Palace and many other buildings were built in the Baroque style The Classical architecture and Neoclassical architecture are the next in the timeline Budapest had not one but two architects that were masters of the Classicist style Mih ly Pollack and J zsef Hild built many beautiful Classicist style buildings in the city Some of the best examples are the Hungarian National Museum the Lutheran Church of Budav r both designed by Pollack and the seat of the Hungarian president the S ndor Palace The most iconic and widely known Classicist style attraction in Budapest is the Sz chenyi Chain Bridge Budapest s two most beautiful Romantic architecture buildings are the Great Synagogue in Doh ny Street and the Vigad Concert Hall on the Danube Promenade both designed by architect Frigyes Feszl Another noteworthy structure is the Budapest Western Railway Station which was designed by August de Serres and built by the Eiffel Company of Paris in Art Nouveau came into fashion in Budapest by the exhibitions which were held in and around and organised in connection with the Hungarian Millennium celebrations Art Nouveau in Hungary Szecesszi in Hungarian is a blend of several architectural styles with a focus on Hungary s specialities One of the leading Art Nouveau architects d n Lechner was inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture as well as traditional Hungarian decorative designs One of his most beautiful buildings in Budapest is the Museum of Applied Arts Another examples for Art Nouveau in Budapest is the Gresham Palace in front of the Chain Bridge the Hotel Gell rt the Franz Liszt Academy of Music or Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden The second half of the th century also saw under the communist regime the construction of blocks of flats panelh z as in other Eastern European countries In the st century Budapest faces new challenges in its architecture The pressure towards the high rise buildings is unequivocal among today s world cities but preserving Budapest s unique cityscape and its very diverse architecture along with green areas is force Budapest to balance between them The Contemporary architecture has wide margin in the city Public spaces attract heavy investment by business and government also so that the city has gained entirely new or renovated and redesigned squares parks and monuments for example the city central Kossuth Lajos square De k Ferenc square and Liberty Square Budapest s urban landscape is one of the modern and contemporary architecture Numerous landmarks are created in the last decade in Budapest like the National Theatre Palace of Arts R k czi Bridge Megyeri Bridge Budapest Airport Sky Court among others and millions of square meters of new office buildings and apartments But there are still large opportunities in real estate development in the city Districts Most of today s Budapest is the result of a late nineteenth century renovation but the wide boulevards laid out then only bordered and bisected much older quarters of activity created by centuries of Budapest s city evolution Budapest s vast urban area is often described using a set of district names These are either informal designations reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl or are superseded administrative units of former boroughs Such names have remained in use through tradition each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character but without official boundaries Originally Budapest had districts after coming into existence upon the unification of the three cities in Since Greater Budapest has been divided into boroughs and

MA insurer revenues are \\n30 percent higher than their health \\n\\ncare spending. Adjusting for enrollee mix\\n, health care spending per \\n\\nenrollee in MA is \\n9 to \\n30 percent lower than in Traditional Medicare \\n(TM), depending on the way we de˜ne ﬁcomparableﬂ enrollees. \\nSpending differences primarily re˚ect differences in health care uti\\n-lization, with similar reductions for ﬁhigh-valueﬂ and ﬁlow-valueﬂ \\n\\ncare\\n, rather than health care prices. We present evidence consistent \\n\\nwith MA plans encouraging substitution to less expensive care and \\n\\nengaging in utilization management. \\n(JEL G22, H44, H51, I11, I13)A  long-standing question in economics concerns the appropriate roles of the public sector and private sector in providing services that society has decided \\nare essential. This question comes up in many contexts, including education, utili\\n-ties, transportation, and pensions. It is especially relevant in health care, where the \\nUnited States is unusual among developed countries in its distinctive mix of public \\n\\nand private health insurance. Comparisons of public and private health insurance \\n\\nsystems are difwever, since they typically do not operate at a similar scale, \\n\\nfor the same population, in the same markets, or with the same health care providers.\\nThe US Medicare program in recent years has been an exception because of the \\nﬁside by sideﬂ operation of public and private insurance programs.
