 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, on November 24th, we will be celebrating the 90th anniversary of the birth of credit unions. St. Mary's Bank of Manchester, New Hampshire opened its doors in 1908 as a true local establishment serving the community on which it was built. St. Mary's Bank was formed by Manchester's French-Canadian immigrant and working class families to help other working class families. I want to congratulate St. Mary's Bank on being the pioneer in the field of credit unions and for continuing to grow and provide community support for the last 90 years. 
In these times of bank mergers and takeovers designed to expand markets beyond boundaries of local communities, St. Mary's has always stood by its roots and the people of Manchester. St. Mary's Bank exemplifies a community institution built on local values and relationships. It continues its tradition of donating to community causes and has begun a $10 million investment in the Manchester community to help low and moderate income families purchase and rent homes, and to provide assistance in emergency situations. 
I wish to recognize St. Mary's Bank of Manchester, New Hampshire for its 90 years of service to the community of Manchester's West Side and for marking the beginning of credit unions nationwide.

Mr. GREGG. The conference report includes language which directs the Secretary of Commerce to ensure continuation of weather service coverage for the communities of Williston, North Dakota; Caribou, Maine; Erie, Pennsylvania; and Key West, Florida. 
Further, the Conference provides full funding to the NWS for continued, effective operations at Williston and the other Weather Service offices mentioned.

Mr. GREGG. I will tell the Senator from North Dakota that it is the intent of the conferees that the National Weather Service maintain operations at Williston and the other sites, and further that the NWS take no actions which would suggest an intent to close these offices. Any actions taken towards closure of these offices will signal to the Congress that there will be a resulting degradation of service.

Mr. GREGG. Yes, that is correct. We believe that with respect to these specific offices, including Williston, North Dakota, the NWS modernization plan has not sufficiently demonstrated that service will not be degraded without these offices. The Congress does not want the NWS to close these offices at this time and we are providing specific appropriations to ensure their continued operations. I would also add that we expect the NWS to use these additional funds to develop the appropriate systems to address the unique weather coverage shortfalls that exist for these specific communities. 
I realize that the most difficult problem for Williston, North Dakota is the absence of local radar coverage at low altitudes. We expect that the NWS will use these funds and work cooperatively with the local residents in Williston to mitigate that concern.

 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, Neil Tillotson is one of those rare individuals who has accomplished a great deal in his professional and personal life, but has remained rooted to his origins in the Great North Woods of New Hampshire. On the occasion of his 100th Birthday which will be on December 16, 1998, I rise to salute his remarkable achievements. 
Neil Tillotson's life is emblematic of New Hampshire's values of hard work, independence, and community spirit. A lifelong resident of the North Country, he has been a trailblazer in the latex industry, inventing many new products, and for the last 67 years, he has been the most prolific manufacturer of latex products in the world. Through his business activities, he has provided jobs for many people in the North Country, and products that improve the standard of living for millions of Americans and people around the world. 
But his business acumen is only part of what makes Neil Tillotson special. He also holds the unique honor of being the first person to vote in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation Presidential primary, and thus, in the nation. Dixville Notch, where the Presidential primary voting begins at midnight on election day, has been home to the Tillotson family for many years, and as patriarch of Dixville Notch, Neil Tillotson has been the first person to cast his vote since 1960. 
New Hampshire takes its politics seriously at all levels, from the school board to the Presidential primary, and Neil Tillotson has been a serious player for many years. Since we don't yet have a professional sports team, I guess you could say politics is our state sport, and without Neil Tillotson's support, I might be sitting on the bench watching, instead of playing on the field. 
Politics runs deep in many New Hampshire towns and I think that is so because we have a strong sense of community that is expressed through our participation in the representative process. It has a way of bringing us together, and Neil Tillotson has been an example to many people, prompting them to get involved in the political process. 
Over his 100 years, Neil Tillotson has been a participant in some of the great events of the 20th Century, including service in World War I as a member of General Pershing's cavalry and in the triumph of capitalism over communism. 
I turned 50 myself just a few years ago, and I can only hope to live as long and contribute as much to our state as Neil Tillotson. It is a rare person who lives to be 100 years old, but for someone like Neil Tillotson, like so many other things, he makes it look easy. Neil Tillotson is a remarkable person, and Kathy and I wish him the very best on this momentous occasion.

 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I'd like to take this opportunity to express my thanks and deep appreciation for the work and dedication of Secret Service Special Agent Carl Truscott, who was detailed to the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary (CJS) Subcommittee on Appropriations during the 105th Congress. 
Nearly two years ago, Carl joined the Subcommittee staff as a detailee from the Secret Service. As a seventeen year veteran of the agency, and a member of three Presidential details, Carl was brought on to lend his extensive law enforcement expertise and knowledge to the appropriations process. As the lead staffer handling the appropriations for the Department of Justice, the DEA, and the FBI, he acted as an effective liaison between myself and the agencies. Carl helped reconcile the needs of the Justice Department with my visions for the future of federal law enforcement, often working late nights to hammer out compromises that could make all sides happy. This was a difficult task for anyone to take on without prior knowledge or experience on the Hill, but Carl handled his responsibilities like an old pro. I could not have developed such a close relationship with the offices of the Attorney General, the FBI Director, and the DEA Administrator without Carl's input and commitment to making the connection work. 
Special Agent Truscott will be leaving the Hill to go back to the President's detail starting next week. I know that the Appropriations Committee, the Department of Justice, and my personal staff will all miss Carl's presence in the appropriations process next year. It was a pleasure working with him over the past two years and I wish him luck in his career in the Secret Service and in his future endeavors. 
I'd also like to express my appreciation for the work of Dereck Orr, who was detailed to Senator Hollings' CJS Subcommittee staff from the Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. Dereck has been with the CJS Subcommittee staff for the past year and has contributed important input on law enforcement issues to both sides of the Subcommittee. He has been an asset during the long, difficult appropriations process this year and I join Senator Hollings in praising Dereck's perseverance and commitment. I wish him luck when he returns to the Justice Department and look forward to working with him in the future.

Mr. Gregg. I thank the Senator from Michigan for pointing that out. We included a repeal of section 110 in the CJS appropriations bill. Section 110 would require a tremendous amount of appropriations for what would be, in my view, almost no tangible benefit. We should be responsible with our appropriations and ensure that federal monies are spent on immigration enforcement efforts that really will be effective, rather than on unintended, untried, and untested systems.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of talk about education in the last few days, especially from the White House, and about adequate funding for education. I think no item more clearly defines the difference between the two parties on the issue of funding education than the issue of special education. 
This White House has been so enthusiastic for creating new programs, that are controlled here in Washington, which tell the teachers, principals, parents, and students back in my State, and in the State of Mississippi, where the occupant of the Chair comes from, and every State of this country, how they shall run their schools on a day-to-day basis, how to manage curriculums, whom they shall hire, when they shall hire them, what they will do after school. This administration has been so insistent in trying to move the control of education to the Federal level and now has come forward with a new series of efforts to accomplish that. But this administration has failed consistently to fund the most fundamental obligation of the Federal Government in the area of education--specifically, the obligation under special education. 
Back in 1976, I think, when the special education bill was passed, which was a major step forward in this Nation toward caring for kids who have special needs, the Federal Government committed to the local communities of this country that it would pay 40 percent of the cost of those children's educational needs. But what has happened? Well, when the Republican Congress took control of Congress 4 years ago, at that point, the obligations being paid by the Federal Government weren't 40 percent of the cost of special ed needs, they were only 6 percent of the costs. The difference, 34 percent, which was supposed to be picked up by the Federal Government, was being borne by the local taxpayer. 
What was the practical effect of that? The practical effect of that was that the local tax burden was skewed and the local school districts' ability to support their educational agenda was controlled not by what they wanted to do but by their need to meet a Federal mandate that was not being paid for by the Federal Government--specifically, special education. So where a local school board might have wanted to add new teachers, or an afterschool program, or a new language program, or put in new computers, they could not do it. Why? Because they had to pay the cost of the special education students, which costs were supposed to be borne by the Federal Government, at least to the extent of 40 percent. 
So you would have thought that this `education Presidency'--as it tries to proclaim itself--would have wanted to correct that problem, would have recognized that as the first step in its efforts on education, and would have fulfilled the underlying obligation to special needs kids and paid the 40 percent the Federal Government is obliged to pay under the law. 
What actually happened? In every budget that the President of the United States has sent up to this Congress since this Congress was taken over by the Republican Party, there has been essentially no increase in funding for special education. As a result, what this administration has said is: Rather than funding the needs of special ed kids, we want to create brand new programs, we want to go out and tell the school districts what they are going to have to do with Federal dollars, rather than using the Federal dollars to fund the needs of the special needs kids the way we are supposed to under the law. 
So they set up this scenario where they say to local school districts: We are not going to pay you what we are supposed to and allow you to free up your money to spend it on what you need, such as books and teachers--or whatever the local school district thinks it needs. 
Rather, we are going to tell you what you need, and we are going to make you come to the Federal Government, come to the Federal bureaucrat, and say, `Please, Federal bureaucrat, give us back some of our money so we can pay for new educational initiatives.' But we have to do exactly what you tell us in initiating those initiatives. It obviously makes no sense. 
What did the Republican Congress do? It said let's live up to our obligations as a Congress first. So we made a priority. In fact, S. 1, the No. 1 bill of the Senate, made as its priority setting a course to fully fund special education at the 40 percent required under the law. We made great strides in this under the leadership of the majority leader, under the leadership of the Senator from Pennsylvania, who is the head of the appropriations subcommittee, with the strong effort of the coalition here on our side of the aisle. 
We have increased funding for special education dramatically in the last 3 years, with no help from the administration. Three years ago, we put it up; we increased special education funding by almost $700 million. Last year, we increased it by almost $690 million. This year, we have increased it again by $500 million. So we have taken the percentage which the Federal Government is paying for special education from 6 percent when we took control of the Congress up to over 10 percent now, and it is moving in the right direction. 
Now, one more time this week, we hear this disingenuous argument coming from the administration that if we are going to have good education, we have to create a new program where the Federal Government, the President, and his friends at some national labor union and down here at the Department of Education tell local educators how to spend their dollars and what they must spend their dollars on. 
If the President really wanted to address the educational needs of this country, he would say to local school districts: I want another $1 billion, but I want to give it back to the local school districts to help them with special education, and that will free up the local school districts to be able to spend money for what they think they need. 
Not every school district in this country needs more teachers. Not every school district in this country has a terrible school building. Some school districts need more computers. Some school districts want to expand their language programs. Some school districts want to expand their dance programs. Some may want to expand their math programs. That decision should be made at the local level. Only the parents, only the teachers, only the principals really know what a local school district needs in order to make it a better place for kids to learn in. We don't know in Washington. 
Yet, the President and his friends and his supporters seem to feel that they know best, that they can run all the school districts in this country out of some building down here on Constitution Avenue. It doesn't work that way. 
If we really want to help out local school districts, what we will do is relieve them of having to fulfill the obligations of the Federal Government by paying the costs of special education and free up those dollars so that the local school districts can spend them where they see fit, where they feel they will get the best return. If we really want to help local education, what we will do as a Congress and what the President should be suggesting is that we will fund the special education needs of kids in this country to the tune of 40 percent, which we committed to. 
Ironically, if you take the dollars being proposed by the President to be spent on his new categorical programs where he tells everybody in the country how to run their school districts, and you add them up, in 5 years--which is the goal that we have set as a Republican Congress--in 5 years, you will be at just about the 40 percent that the Federal Government said it was going to spend on special education. If you take those dollars and you move them over to special education, you will be accomplishing what we said we were going to do back in the 1970s. But, more importantly, we will be freeing up the local school districts to educate kids the way they know they must be educated rather than the way some bureaucrat down here in Washington thinks they should be educated. 
That is the difference. That is what the debate is about. The Republicans believe that schools should be operated at the local level, that it should be the parents, the teachers, and the principals who make the decisions on education. Regrettably, some of our colleagues on the other side, and clearly the people down on Pennsylvania Avenue, feel that they know better than parents, teachers, and principals--they should be the ones operating our schools. 
This is not a dollar fight. It is not a question of putting more dollars in education. It is a question of where the dollars go, how they are better managed, how they can give the best return for the dollars spent for education which we need. 
So there is the difference. 
The Republican Congress is showing the right way. We have put our money in the right programs. We have committed to special education the huge increase in spending. I just wish the President would join us in that. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise, along with my colleague Senator John Breaux, to introduce the 21st Century Retirement Savings Act. 
Earlier this year, I joined Senator Breaux as two of six co-sponsors of S. 2313, a bill to strengthen and preserve Social Security. This legislation was developed through the expertise of the National Commission on Retirement Policy, convened by the Center of Strategic and International Studies. 
The Commission was unique among such efforts in that it looked at the entire picture surrounding retirement saving, and did not seek to increase income through one venue at the expense of another. It was our finding that income through all of the components of the national retirement structures--Social Security, employer-provided pensions, and individual savings--needed to be increased if we are to meet the needs of the 21st century. 
This legislation to shore up private retirement savings is a companion piece to S. 2313, which dealt with Social Security. I am pleased that it will also be introduced by Congressmen Kolbe and Stenholm in the House.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas as a second degree to the amendment offered by myself, Senator McCain, and Senator Lieberman, which is the underlying amendment here. I think the Senator from Oregon, who has certainly been a core player in bringing this matter to the Senate, outlined the issue rather well by pointing out that the purpose of this moratorium and the commission that is created under the moratorium should be to review the electronic commerce under the Internet and to pursue a path which will make that commerce more efficient. 
This bill, this attempt to protect the Internet from arbitrary taxation across the country with the 30,000 potential municipalities that could assess against the Internet and thus create chaos in what is truly one of the great engines of prosperity and economic entrepreneurship which has occurred within this century, and may be the economic engine for the next century--this bill, which is an attempt to put a hold on that sort of tax policy which might undermine, fundamentally harm, the expansion of the Internet during this formative period is a good bill, but it should not be used to bootstrap other issues onto the question. 
What is being attempted here is a backdoor bootstrapping of the whole issue of tax policy as it relates to the question of sales at distant points, whether it happens to be under the Internet, cable, catalogs or by telephone. And another study in this area, which is the proposal that is put forward by the Senator from Arkansas, is simply an attempt to broaden the scope of the underlying effort, which is to protect and address the issues that evolve around the Internet. It is totally inappropriate. There is no reason we should go down that road. 
There have been enumerable studies of this issue already. In fact, I have two right here, one done by the League of Cities and the other done by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. I also understand there has been one done by the Governors' Association, I believe. The fact is, the issues which are being raised by the Senator from Arkansas have been studied and studied extensively. Putting another study into this bill is not going to in any way change the tenor of the debate. It is simply going to attempt to expand the debate into a whole separate arena, which is inappropriate to this moratorium. 
The bottom line of this moratorium--and I will come to that after we have disposed of the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas, but the bottom line issue here is whether or not by voting to expand the moratorium and to get into areas such as the Senator from Arkansas has proposed we wish to dramatically expand the taxing authority of States and local jurisdictions and basically use this bill to become a huge vehicle for expansion in tax policy and expansion of taxes. 
I do not think that most Members of this body want to do that, and we already voted on this issue once with the Bumpers amendment. The vote was overwhelming. This body said no, it did not want to use this vehicle for the purposes of creating an explosion in new taxes. And yet there is another attempt being made now to do that, this time through a study. We will hear another attempt, I suspect, from the Senator from Florida who will do that with his amendment to this bill and this underlying amendment. 
So I guess what it comes down to is that this body has to make a policy decision: Does it want to use the Internet bill and the protection of the Internet, which has been proposed through the moratorium, which has been energized in large part by the Senator from Oregon, and obviously the Senator from Arizona, and which I have strongly supported, does it want to use that effort to try to protect the Internet to also be an effort to grossly expand the tax laws of this country and the tax policy of this country and the tax activity of municipalities and States, or do we want to stay focused on the subject at hand, which is how to make the Internet an efficient and effective place to do business, how to keep it as a dynamic engine for entrepreneurship and prosperity that it has become through a moratorium on taxes which might be assessed at the local community level? 
Although this amendment is couched in the terms of a study, it really gets back to that core issue of whether or not we want to have a moratorium which addresses the Internet or whether we want to use this moratorium as a bootstrapping event for purposes of dramatically increasing taxes and the tax collection capacity of local communities and States across the country. 
I oppose this study. I think it is misdirected to be attached to this bill, and I would say that if you really are interested in such a study, here is one you can read. Here is another one you can read. And the Governors' Association has one you can read. You don't have to pay for a new one. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to support the position of the chairman of the committee on this issue in opposition to the Senator from Florida. 
The proposal which the Senator from Florida is suggesting goes really to the essence of this debate, which is whether or not 30,000 municipalities and State agencies across this country are going to have the right to essentially assess taxes in an arbitrary way on one of the most dynamic vehicles of commerce that has never come forward in the experience of the world. The chaos which those 30,000 municipalities and State agencies would create should they be able to assess that type of taxation on the Internet would be overwhelming. It might totally defeat what has been one of the great engines of economic activity and prosperity which our Nation has enjoyed over the last few years. 
It is not a unique situation. We can go all the way back to John Marshall to determine that the Congress has the right to make the decision on the issue of policy relative to taxation in commerce. It was, of course, Chief Justice Marshall who determined that when a ferry was crossing a river between two States that that ferry could not be taxed by the local State if it was going to interfere with interstate commerce. 
This concept has carried through our jurisprudence since that time--that the Federal Government reserves the unique right to determine the taxation of commerce. 
There is no reason why we should arbitrarily handicap ourselves by creating a supermajority within our own institution to exercise that right, which is what the Senator from Florida is proposing. 
Let's continue the policies which have done us so well in the area of tax policy for the last 200 years, which is a majority of the Congress to make a decision as to what tax policy shall be in international trade. Let's not create some artificial barrier for us to jump over as an institution as we try to deal with what is a tremendous real ferry that may be created by having 30,000 municipalities and State agencies across the country assess taxes against the Internet. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the distinguished chairman of the Committee, Senator Jeffords, I would like to engage him in a brief discussion of a proposal that was raised during Senate consideration of the higher education reauthorization bill. 
As the chairman will recall, the managers' amendment offered during Senate consideration included sense-of-the-Senate language regarding the need for greater flexibility in federal student loan programs. Specifically, there were some of us interested in increasing the annual limits on unsubsidized loans while maintaining the aggregate limits, so that students could take greater advantage of federal loans available at lower interest rates. Unfortunately, a substantive amendment to advance that proposal was scored by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) as increasing mandatory spending, and adequate offsets could not be found. 
My purpose in raising this matter again today is to elicit from the chairman an indication of his support for this loan flexibility proposal on a substantive policy basis, in the hope that, if we can ever find the additional resources necessary to cover its costs, we might enjoy the chairman's support in pressing for its enactment.

Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wanted to return to the floor; I have spoken about this issue before, but I wanted to continue to raise the issue because as we move into the final weeks of this session of the Congress, it is one of the core issues we have to address; that is, the question of budget discipline as a Congress. 
It has taken us a long time--29 years, I believe--to get to a surplus, but this year we finally have a surplus. The American people place great faith in that and appreciation in that, and we as a Congress, obviously, are proud of the fact we finally reached a surplus. It was done as a result of a lot of hard work. We made some difficult decisions. We tightened down on the spending of the Federal Government and we especially maintained fiscal discipline here in the Congress. We did that through the use of what are known as caps. We set a budget in place, we had a 5-year budget agreement with the President last year, and it has led us on a glidepath to a surplus. The key to that budget agreement was that we set spending limits. We said: `We shall not exceed those spending limits.' 
Unfortunately, as we move towards the closing days of this Congress, we appear to be at the point of almost saying that the caps are irrelevant, that the disciplining effects which they had which got us to this surplus are going to be cast overboard. That is because we have something coming at us called an emergency supplemental. 
An emergency supplemental is not an emergency, it is simply a bunch of spending which is going to be done outside the budget process, independent of the caps. On top of the spending which we said we would make, we are going to add new spending. It is as if you were running a household and you had income of $100 a week and you set your spending on your grocery bills and your electric bills so they would meet that $100. And then suddenly you said, `I happened to make $110 this week so I am going to spend $110--well, no, maybe I'll spend $120. I am not going to limit my spending by what I had originally planned, I am simply going to raise it arbitrarily.' 
That is what is happening here. We are using a vehicle called an emergency supplemental to arbitrarily increase the spending of the Federal Government. The projection now is that we are going to have an emergency supplemental somewhere in the vicinity of $20 billion. That is a lot of money. That is going to have a very dramatic impact on the surplus, because the surplus is projected to be not a great deal higher than $20 billion. It could literally, depending on the economic effects of the Asian situation and the slowdown of the American economy, it could literally slow down arriving at the surplus if we spend $20 billion more than we budgeted for, to exceed the caps in that way. 
Why does it get designated as an emergency? It gets designated as an emergency because, if it didn't get designated as an emergency, it would be subject to a point of order and you would have to get 60 votes in order to spend it. But if it is designated as an emergency, it does not get hit with a point of order and therefore it can be spent with just a majority of Congress supporting it. So the budget discipline is lifted off. 
What are these emergencies? One of the emergencies is that the year 2000 is coming. As my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth, who happens to be one of the more original folks around here, said: Are we just suddenly learning that the 
year 2000 is coming? That is hardly an emergency. We know and we have known for a long time that the year 2000 is coming. Thus, the additional $3 billion to address that is not an emergency. It should have been budgeted for. 
Another emergency is Bosnia. Did we suddenly find out that we are in Bosnia? No. We have known we have been in Bosnia for quite a while. Obviously, that is not an emergency. 
Another emergency happens to be the farm program. Originally it was asking for $2 billion in emergency spending. Now it is up to $4 billion. The leader on the other side wants to make it $7 billion. I have to tell you, every year that I have been in the Congress the farm program has come to us and asked for an emergency spending bill. There is no emergency here, other than the fact that that is the way the money gets spent--outside of the budget process. We all know that certain areas of this country every year are going to have problems with their farm program. It is simply a function of weather and factors like weather. In this case, it is a function of the international economy going flat. But every year we have this. It is a predictable event, so it is not an emergency. It is something that we should be anticipating. 
Then we hear also that the President is going to come forward with emergency spending for defense. Clearly, defense needs more money. It is rather unusual that the President should be saying this, because for the last 6 years he has essentially tried to cut defense and increase spending on all the other programs in the Federal Government on the back of defense, and now it suddenly becomes an emergency that he has figured out that after 6 years he has cut defense so dramatically that it is in a horrendous situation and we are basically heading towards a military establishment which may be a shell, which may not be able to deliver the defense of the United States. 
That may be an emergency in the sense that it is a clear threat to this country, but from a fiscal standpoint it was a known action which was taken by this administration over the last 6 years, to savage the defense budget, which has led us to this point. If it is the desire of the administration to suddenly increase defense funding, they should do it within the context of the budget process and take money from some of their beloved programs for which they have moved money out of defense and into those programs--take it back from those beloved programs and put it back in defense spending so this country is adequately defended. 
So the fact is, as we head towards the closing days of this session, we confront a potential hemorrhaging of the budget process through an emergency supplemental. We are hearing with crocodile tears, I think, a lot of talk from the leader of the other body and from the Vice President, and even the President to some degree, that any tax cut would be an attack on the Social Security trust fund because any tax cut would come out of surplus and thus would be taken from the Social Security trust fund. That is the mantra, now, of the political operatives of this world who work for the Democratic Party, the James Carvilles. That is what they are going to try to label Republicans: `You are going to cut taxes and you are going to cut Social Security, because that's going to come out of the surplus.' 
What is good for the goose is good for the gander. If that is the case when the President sends up here a $20 billion supplemental request, many of which are not emergencies but which are predictable events--like the year 2000, like the agricultural situation, like Bosnia, like the defense issues--if they are going to send that amount of money up and ask that it come out of the emergency supplemental funding process, which means it comes directly out of the surplus, that also is an attack on Social Security in the same context as a tax cut on the Social Security trust fund. 
You can't have it both ways, Mr. President and members of the administration. You can't be saying a tax reduction has an impact on Social Security but the emergency supplemental doesn't. They both do, because the surplus is a function of excess tax revenue coming in under the Social Security trust fund. 
What should we do? The proper fiscal thing to do is to offset this funding, these expenditures which we are going to undertake on the emergency supplemental. Granted, we can't do it all, I accept that, but we should certainly offset a large percentage of it. So before we come out here and hemorrhage the discipline that got us to a surplus, undermining the core elements that gave us fiscal solvency as a Nation for the first time in 29 years, I think we should pause and think about that and say, `Listen, maybe we ought to step back, try to figure out a way to pay for this supplemental so we don't undermine the budget process and undermine the surplus and, to some degree, undermine the Social Security trust fund. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with the sad task of informing the Senate of the passing of one of my staff, Connie Drakeley. Connie died in her sleep last week and coming to terms with her sudden passing has been difficult. 
Connie was a very important member of my staff and will be greatly missed. She will be missed not only for the large contributions she made to the office, but also because she was our friend. 
Connie joined my staff in March, 1995 in the position of Editor. She came aboard during a time when the mail was building up and a significant backlog was forming--in short order, Connie alleviated the problem. 
The mail we receive from our constituents and, in return, answer is the lifeblood of our representative government. It was in this context and with this attitude that Connie worked as Editor on my staff. She, in many ways, had the hardest job in the office--with red pen, she pointed out everyone's mistakes! But she always worked very diligently, professionally and responsibly. She worked long hours and often took work home with her; she made us all better writers. She labored in this manner to make sure that my mail was without fault. 
Connie was always ready with advice and assistance when someone on staff needed help right away with a letter, speech or a press release. Though the work load sometimes could have overwhelmed her, she always rose to the challenge and kept her promises to get her editing done on time. 
She was very knowledgeable and up-to-date on legislation--she watched the floor, read Congress Daily--she didn't just correct grammar, but content as well. She knew the issues and could spot a mistake a mile away. We realized how much the entire process depended on her whenever she took vacation. Mail came first to Connie! I will always be thankful for her remarkable commitment to a demanding and stressful job and her respect for the English language. 
Connie dedicated her life to being the best editor one can be. Before she came to my office, she worked as an editor for Senator Harry Reid, for the National Archives, for Bechtel, and as a picture researcher for LIFE magazine. 
I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to Connie's daughter, brother and other family members. On behalf of my entire office, I wish to let them know that our prayers and thoughts are with them. 
Connie was an indispensable member of our team; her energy, vitality, and dedication will be missed for a long time. We simply couldn't have accomplished what we did on a weekly basis for the past few years without her. Personally and professionally, we have lost a good friend and coworker.

 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, Not too many businesses last a generation or two, much less for 175 years, but the Argus Champion seems to be Energizer Bunny of the newspaper business. This longevity, which is rare, is due primarily to its commitment to the local community. The Argus Champion has served its community well by providing local news and national news of interest. As a result, the Argus Champion has developed a loyal following in its hometown of Newport and the surrounding areas. 
Although the paper has had numerous owners, editors, reporters, and staff over the years, the Argus Champion has consistently published a high-quality newspaper that reflects New Hampshire's traditions and heritage. The paper also has changed with the times, switching to color formats in 1997 and expanding news coverage in surrounding areas in an effort to bring a better product to more Granite Staters. 
In many ways, our local newspaper is the chronicler of the times, printing important stories about the local community and the people who live in it. The Argus itself recognizes this special role, and each week offers to its readers a variety of local historical information through a feature column. We look forward to seeing pictures of our neighbors and their children volunteering to raise money for a worthwhile cause, or participating in the Boys and Girls Scouts and the Little League Baseball team. We also value our local paper for all of the announcements about milestones in our lives, including weddings, births, deaths, promotions, and others. We also appreciate the political coverage provided to the community as it helps the voters make informed decisions in the ballot booth and understand how the actions of their elected officials affect their everyday lives. 
The Argus Champion has brought the community together by focusing on local news and it is that tradition that we celebrate today on the 175th Anniversary of the paper's beginning. A warm congratulations to all of those who have contributed to the success of the Argus Champion and best wishes for the future.

<TEXT>
Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, there are three issues which I think we need to be thinking about addressing as we move into the end of this session. The first is an emergency spending bill which is coming at us and how we pay for that. 
Traditionally, emergency spending bills have been paid for outside the budget process. We have worked very hard, however, as a Congress and as a country to get our budget in balance. It has not been an easy task. It has taken us 29 years to get the budget in balance. This year we will have a $60 billion surplus, and that surplus is projected to continue for a number of years into the future. But that surplus will be quickly frittered away if we add new spending programs that are not paid for, or if we arbitrarily increase the spending of the Federal Government in programs that already exist without looking at our budgeting process. 
The emergency supplemental, as well meaning as it is intended to be, represents, in my opinion, and raises the issue of how we are going to maintain our surplus and threatens that surplus. 
Since 1993, we have had $37 billion of spending under emergency bills. That is $37 billion that has been spent outside the budget process and has essentially added to the deficit, or in the case of this year, reduced the surplus. 
This year, the emergency supplemental is being talked about as a rather huge bill. In the past, since 1993, the average of those bills has been somewhere in the vicinity of $5 billion or $6 billion. But now we are talking about an emergency supplemental of--I have heard a number as high as $20 billion. But anything in the range of even $10 billion or $15 billion would be a huge number and would significantly reduce the surplus unless it was offset. 
The purpose of an emergency supplemental is to address issues which we had not anticipated which need immediate action and to do so promptly. I can agree with all those purposes, but unfortunately, the emergency supplemental process has become a process which has basically been used as a giant loophole through which we have generated new spending and, thus, are putting at risk, in many instances, our surplus as we finally reached it. 
Secondly, we have to ask ourselves, From where is this money coming? In the past, we were borrowing it and creating debt, which was bad enough. This time when we fund this emergency supplemental, if it is anywhere near the range of $15 billion or $20 billion, that is all basically going to come out of the Social Security trust fund. We will be borrowing from the Social Security trust fund because this year the surplus is essentially generated by the Social Security taxes which exceed the Social Security expenses. That, in and of itself, raises huge public policy issues. 
I hope that before we step into this or step off on to this road which leads to this giant loophole in our budgeting process, which generates expenditures outside of our budget caps, that we will think about the process and, hopefully, take a hard look at offsetting a significant amount of this emergency supplemental. 
Much of it was anticipated. We already spent $1.5 billion emergency for Bosnia. We should have been able to anticipate it and offset it. Clearly, the situation that has occurred in the farming communities is a severe emergency, but almost every year we appear to have an emergency in the farming communities. We should be able to budget and offset it. Disaster events have become, regrettably, all too commonplace. They are severe, and they need to be responded to, but we should be able to anticipate and budget it with some sort of reserve account and be setting it off. 
The only event which is truly an emergency which we could not anticipate was the blowing up of the embassies in Africa. I happen to chair the committee that has jurisdiction over that. If I were asked by the appropriating authorities, by the leadership around here to find offsets for the purposes of paying for that, I would be willing to do that, or at least some portion of that. So as to the extent that emergency has occurred, I am willing to go back and see if we can't find some ways to pay the cost of that emergency with some sort of offset, some percentage of it anyway, maybe not the whole amount, but a percentage of it. 
I am simply saying in throwing up a word of caution here, before we step on to this emergency spending process without any offsets, let's look at what it will do to the budget in the outyear and what it will do to the Social Security fund and is it proper to do it without offsets. I don't think it is. Some percentage should be offset. 
Second, I want to talk about caps. Caps are ways we as Congress discipline ourselves, where we say we will not spend more than this amount in any one year. That is what the emergency issue is about, as I alluded to. The emergency spending designation allows you to exceed the caps, which is an appropriate action in the budget process, but is not necessarily a fiscally sound action. 
The caps are in place only for the next 2 years because we do not have in place a budget. We did not reach a budget agreement, and it does not appear we are going to reach a budget agreement this year which would extend the caps over the lifetime of the budget agreement which we reached last year with the President. Last year, we reached the balanced budget agreement, a very important act in the history of this country, which has led to the surplus, in large part, this year and will lead to projected surpluses in the future years. But that budget agreement only had caps for 3 years. It was a 5-year agreement. So we are closing in now on the point when those caps are no longer in existence and we will no longer have any fiscal discipline around here. 
I intend, and I hope I will receive the support of my colleagues, to offer an amendment to whatever the emergency supplemental is to extend the caps for the last 2 years of the budget agreement which we reached with the President. I think that is only reasonable that we do that so that we can be sure that as we move forward in the future that we will have fiscal discipline here and we will stay on the glide path toward maintaining our surplus, which has been so difficult to attain and which is so important to the future of our country. That is the second fiscal point I wanted to make. 
The fiscal third point I want to make is about taxes. It is obvious we are running a surplus, and, yes, that surplus is significant and there is a big demand to cut taxes, which is totally reasonable. 
What is a surplus? It basically means people are paying more in taxes than we are spending in Government. So whose right is it to get the money back? It is the taxpayers' right to get the money back. 
So we should be looking at a tax cut. There are lots of different discussions around here looking at what the tax cut should be. But in looking at this tax cut, we have to look at where the revenue is coming from. 
Revenues for this surplus are coming from the Social Security tax. They are not coming from the general revenue tax. They are not coming from the income tax or the corporate tax or a variety of fees that we charge as a society, as a Government. They are coming from the fact that people are paying more into the Social Security trust fund than the Social Security trust fund is paying out today. As a result, we are running a surplus. That is true through about the year 2001 or maybe even the year 2002, that the surplus of this Government as it is projected will be primarily a Social Security trust fund surplus. 
So when we are looking at a tax cut around here, I think we ought to look at the people who are paying the taxes. That would only be logical. People who are generating the surplus should get the return of the taxes. And that should be the Social Security taxpayer. 
More importantly, there is no more regressive tax that we have on the books than the FICA tax. It is paid across the board. It is paid by everybody. No matter what your earned income is, you pay the FICA tax at the same rate. It is a regressive tax by any stretch of the imagination. No deductions, no exemptions, you pay it. Thus, if we are looking for a place to cut taxes which would benefit the most Americans and be the fairest place to cut taxes, we should be looking at cutting the Social Security tax. 
So as we move down the road to the discussion on tax cuts, let us take a hard look at cutting the FICA tax, returning to the American people more of their tax dollars through a FICA tax cut. In doing that, we ought to also be looking at increasing the savings of the American people and trying to make the Social Security system more solvent in the outyears. 
One way to do that is a proposal that I put forth with Senator Breaux. And a number of other people have talked about it in different machinations--including Senator Moynihan, Senator Grams, Senator Domenici, Senator Kerrey--to take the tax cut and put it into a personal savings account which would be owned by the individual who pays the taxes; and it will be their money, they will have it as an asset, and it will be available for them when they retire. I hope we will consider that as an option also. 
So as we move into this tax cut debate, I intend to raise this whole issue. And I believe we should raise this whole issue of where the taxes are coming from and who appropriately should be getting a tax cut. 
I ask unanimous consent for another 2 minutes.

Mr. GREGG. So three things we need to be concerned about are, first, as we step into this emergency spending water, let us be careful about where the money comes from, let us look at an offset; second, let us get those caps extended so we can have sound fiscal 
policy throughout the 5 years of the balanced budget agreement we reached with the President; and third is, we look at a tax cut, let us have a tax cut that flows back to the people who are paying the taxes, those folks who are paying Social Security taxes.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to direct a question to the majority manager of the Defense Appropriations bill, the distinguished Senator from Alaska. I note that the Committee on Appropriations directs the Department of Defense to make available, from existing funds, up to $8,000,000 for a community retraining, reinvestment, and manufacturing initiative to be conducted by an academic consortia with existing programs in manufacturing and retraining. It is my understanding that the consortia referred to is the New Hampshire Network for Science, Technology and Communication, and further, that the funds should be provided to that organization to create a state wide higher education network among small independent colleges to improve and expand research and training opportunities in science, technology, and communication for undergraduate students and for community, business, and K-12 schools. Am I correct, is that not the intent of the committee?

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. I think it is an excellent amendment. It is an issue that we have raised a number of times at the subcommittee level with the judges. We are not only concerned about the reimbursement schedules being skewed, but we are especially concerned about the fact that in capital crimes we are spending an extraordinary amount of money on defense counsel--over a million dollars in many instances. That comes right out of the taxpayers' pockets. It is very difficult and it skews the entire ability to do other defense work because of how much money is pouring into the capital crime area. 
This specific amendment is right on target. I strongly support it. I hope we will not have to go to a vote on it, but if we do, I hope we can agree to this.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, last night Alan Shepard died. Alan Shepard is a huge figure in the lives of those of us who are in that postwar baby boom generation which went through the Sputnik experience and the early days of our space program. He is a huge figure especially for those of us who come from New Hampshire, because he was born and raised in Derry, NH, a small town. In fact, a while after he went into space, for many years, Derry sort of changed its name and called itself Space Town in honor of Alan Shepard. 
He was really an extraordinary American, embodying so much of what makes our country a special place. He came from a small, rural community. It has gotten quite big. In fact, it is a city now. But when he grew up, it was still a small, rural community. He committed his life to service of this Nation and, of course, he was one of those exceptional people who was in the early test pilot program which transitioned into the early astronaut program. We have the great benefit of having another one of those exceptional people in the Senate with us in Senator Glenn. 
Alan Shepard was the first to go into space as an American, and his impact on our country was extraordinary because of that. I can recall very vividly--I must have been 9 or 10 years old --that our whole class in school met in the evening in order to watch this thing called Sputnik go through the sky. And it threw a great scare into our Nation at the time because we, at that time, having come out of World War II and the Korean war, viewed ourselves as a nation of extraordinary strength and really a nation of at least scientific leadership that was unparalleled, and suddenly the Soviet Union, which was a clear and present threat of proportions which cannot even be appreciated today, had launched a satellite which made it clear we were not maybe as far ahead as we thought we were. In fact, in the area of space we were behind. 
And so the commitment was made to overtake the Soviet lead in space technology, but, more importantly, to make America the preeminent space explorer of the world. That commitment was made first by President Eisenhower and followed aggressively by President Kennedy, President Johnson and President Nixon. But the personification of the success of that commitment was Alan Shepard, because not only did he go into space as the first American, but then after overcoming significant physical restrictions--he had a very severe inner ear problem which he went back and had operated on--he went back into space and landed on the Moon. Of course, who can forget his hitting a golf ball on the Moon. I think he used a 6 iron and hit it 300 yards--almost a Tiger Woods drive. 
Alan Shepard was a person who believed totally in the American dream and who lived the American dream. He was an icon of our culture and clearly a dominant figure of our time. We will miss him. In New Hampshire, we will especially miss him because we are very proud of him. We are a small State. At that time we had less than 1 million people, and here it is, with less than 1 million people, we sent the first person in space and he was from New Hampshire. Great pride. 
I express my sorrow to his family and join with all Americans in thanking him for what he did for our Nation, to restore our pride in ourselves and to establish once again that we are a nation that is unique, filled with people who are unique, who, when we pull together to take on a task, no matter how daunting, such as putting a person on the Moon and putting a person in space, will always succeed.

Mr. GREGG. Madam President, to bring our colleagues up to speed, we now are down to four amendments which are still to be debated and on which votes may be ordered. We presently have votes ordered on at least three amendments. We are waiting for our colleagues who have these amendments in order to come to the floor and make their presentations. It looks as if we will begin voting probably in an hour or so, I hope. There will be a sequence of votes that will be at least three long, potentially six. 
Madam President, I make a point of order a quorum is not present.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, while we are waiting, I would like to take a moment. We are, hopefully, about to move to final passage after the vote on the Smith amendment is taken care of. 
I would like to take a moment to thank the staff for the extraordinarily hard work they put into this. Both the majority staff and the minority staff spent countless hours bringing this bill forward. It is a complicated bill. They spent the last 3 or 4 days, almost, working on it. We have seen a lot of amendments. More than a little bit of intricate thought has gone into it. It has a very complex matrix of issues. And it could not possibly have been managed without the strong and professional support that we have received from the staff. 
I would like to also specifically thank former minority clerk Scott Gudes, who has moved on but whose work for 12 years on this committee was extraordinary, and whom I very much enjoyed working with. His replacement, Lila Helms, is a great addition and has carried on Scott's exceptional work. Emelie East and Dereck Orr have also been great assets, I am sure, to the minority and to the majority, as a result of their efforts. 
On my own staff, countless hours have been put in, and I especially thank Jim Morhard, who is clerk of the committee. I don't think he has seen his family, or anyone else, other than the inside of these walls for days and weeks. I very much appreciate his efforts and the expertise he has brought to this. 
Along with him, the professional staff of Paddy Link, Kevin Linskey, Carl Truscott, Dana Quam, and Vas Alexopoulos have been extraordinary; Kris Pickler, and Jackie Cooney of my personal staff, and Virginia Wilbert, who have been extraordinary also, have not only put their oars in but have aggressively rowed this boat toward the shore. We hope it will arrive very soon. 
It is really a team effort. And we have an extremely strong team, a team made up of Cal Ripkens and Ken Griffeys. We are very lucky to have them, and we thank them for all their time and effort. 
I have been advised that the Democratic leader is willing to proceed with a vote at 3:15. We will begin voting on the Smith amendment at 3:15.

I understand your concern about the possible adverse effects the closure of the Boston Regional Office could have on the people of New England, and while we have not heard a groundswell of protest from the public for keeping the office open, the situation may well be that the office will not be missed until or if New Englanders can no longer get the response they expected when lodging consumer complaints. The GAO findings as to the effectiveness of the Boston office should certainly be considered by the FTC Commissioners as they plan their restructuring plan to maximize their resources to best serve the consumers of the U.S., and including the residents of New England. I thank the lady Senator from Maine for requesting the GAO Study so that the FTC can quantify the best use of their limited resources.

Mr. GREGG. I wish to enter into a colloquy with Senator Faircloth in order to address his concerns about the conservation of swordfish. 
The National Marine Fisheries Service is in the process of implementing several management measures to ensure sustainable use of the Atlantic swordfish resource. The rampant importation of undersized Atlantic swordfish harvested by foreign fishing vessels is one of the most serious problems facing domestic and international management of this highly migratory species. The Congress recognizes the significance of this effort and, through the leadership of Senator Faircloth, this appropriations subcommittee provided $500,000 in this fiscal year for NMFS to fully address this specific concern. 
The Committee intends that NMFS will utilize this particular appropriation to implement changes in our current system in order to prevent importation of Atlantic swordfish not harvested in a manner that is consistent with recommendations under the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). 
I ask my colleague from North Carolina to elaborate upon the intent of the Committee in its initiative to address Atlantic swordfish importation problems.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, my home State of New Hampshire leads the nation in the percentage of private sector employees in high technology jobs. The high technology business in New Hampshire has made the State economy strong and has helped lower the unemployment rate. I am pleased with the investment that high technology companies have made in my state. I am concerned, however, that the benefits to the State from these industries do not reach the more rural areas of New Hampshire. Much of the benefits of the high technology growth have been concentrated in the southern, more urban parts of the State. The more rural areas in the north are not growing as quickly or realizing the benefits of new, innovative technology as widely. 
It recently came to my attention that the University of Hew Hampshire's Wittemore School of Business Small Development Center (NH SBDC) has come up with a plan to help the rural areas in New Hampshire take advantage of New Hampshire's technology industries' growth. The NH SBDC proposes to launch a model program to provide technical assistance to small-medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) in rural areas, which will allow them to benefit from the innovative technology being utilized in other parts of the state. New Hampshire's program could serve as a model for other states that are experiencing similarly slow growth in rural areas. Among the services that NH SBDC intends to provide are: linking rural SMMs to high technology companies; identifying SMMs that have the greatest potential for implementing economic development in rural areas; and helping SMMs identify critical paths to success in their areas. 
The NH SBDC would like to implement this plan with funds from the Small Business Administration (SBA). The SBA often funds projects similar to this and, in fact, currently has a successful program in place called the SBA 7(j) program that provides funding for training and technical assistance to rural areas. If the SBA and the NH SBDC work together to develop the plan outlined by NH SBDC, I believe that it could have a significant positive impact on New Hampshire's rural manufacturers. The knowledge gained from this innovative concept can eventually help all States overcome similar problems in rural areas. 
I urge the SBA to accommodate the NH SBDC's request for assistance with this project. I look forward to working with the SBA to ensure that this program can be launched to help rural companies all over the United States benefit from the innovative technologies that are used in more urban areas.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I could respond at some length to the comments made by the Senator from Alabama. His intensity of concern and his legitimate efforts, which have been extraordinary in the area of juvenile justice, are something that I admire. He obviously has strong feelings expressed by the Senator from Delaware. 
I know that there are a number of other Senators who wish to speak on this issue to express their thoughts. But I have had the courtesy of a number of Senators who have come up to me and said they would withhold their statements because there is a group of Members who wish to get down to the White House for the bill signing on the IRS, which is a fairly significant bill. I would like to get this vote completed before that occurs. 
Let me simply say that I believe this is an extraordinarily balanced approach. We have eventually divided the money between prevention and incarceration, for the lack of a better term. It is an attempt to address both sides of the issue of juvenile justice within this bill. Yes, there are other programs outside of this bill that address both sides. In fact, there is a lot more incarceration money in this bill that wasn't talked about. But the fact is that this is a very balanced approach, both sets of programs are extremely credible, and we will move forward on the issue that we are concerned about, which is trying to reduce juvenile crime, which is clearly one of the major issues facing this country today. 
Mr. President, at this time I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for those words--those type of words. She could speak all day. We appreciate that, to say the least. I want to especially thank her for her extremely supportive and aggressive assistance in the `Innocent Images' effort, which she has pointed to and explained to us that arose out of a situation in Maryland. The central nervous system for the FBI initiative is now in Baltimore. What they are doing, I think, is very appropriate. They are developing protocol so they can spread this knowledge of how to fight cybercrime against kids across the country to other levels of law enforcement, and they are using the protocols developed at Baltimore to do that. It has really been a tremendous success story for the agency. 
It is in large part because of the support this committee has given to the FBI that they have been successful in this. Although they were the ones who initiated it and they should get the credit for it, that support has come as a result of the strong and firm commitment of the Senator from Maryland, and her understanding of the threat. The threat is very significant. 
As she knows, because she has gone to the actual site of the activity where the FBI is pursuing these sort of sting operations--I have seen it done at remote sites--the amount of attempts by people who are clearly not pursuing a positive use of cyberspace for our children, the amount of hits in a chat room, which appear to have very significant negative potential for our kids, is overwhelming. You can turn on a chat room, introduce yourself as a 12-year-old girl, and within a very brief period of time--30 seconds--have five or six hits in that chat room, which will ask for illicit or lead to illicit activity in an attempt to get pornographic material, or in an attempt to expose that child to pornographic material. 
Regrettably, they create travel cases where they try to get the child to go and meet with the pedophile. In fact, we had a situation in New Hampshire where somebody actually traveled all the way from Norway to Keene, NH, because that individual thought they were going to be able to have some sort of sexual activity with a child. Luckily, in this instance at least, it was a police officer who was using the Internet following the protocols that the FBI set out of `Innocent Images' that was able to stop and apprehend that individual. 
But it is a very serious issue because the Internet is a great and expansive source for our kids and something that our kids should have access to with the opportunity to learn, the opportunity to communicate with people across the world. It is just a unique and special opportunity or activity that our generation did not have and the next generation does have. Making it safer for our kids is critical. So I thank very much the Senator from Maryland. I am in support of her FBI initiatives in this area and certainly appreciate her kind comments.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with.

Mr. GREGG. I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator Lott, Senator Domenici, Senator Mack, Senator Gramm, and myself. 
I will now propound a consent allowing for two votes, hopefully shortly, on this Social Security issue, the first vote being a vote in relation to the majority version of the amendment, to be followed by a vote in relationship to the Hollings amendment. If an objection is heard, I will have no choice but to fill up the amendment tree so that our vote is guaranteed to be the first vote. 
I would note that the amendment we have sent to the desk seeks the same goal in that what we seek is to preserve the surplus for the Social Security system so that Social Security can be saved first. That should be the first and primary purpose of the use of the surplus. 
However, we make the point in our amendment that after Social Security has been saved, after we have reached an agreement for how to save Social Security--and I happen to have a bill which accomplishes that. It would save it for the next 100 years. It happens to be a bipartisan bill of Senator Breaux and myself. There are other proposals floating around. The Senator in the Chair is a strong supporter of a number of initiatives to save Social Security. But after an agreement has been reached by the Congress and we have put in place a system for saving Social Security, our sense-of-the-Senate says then let's send the money back to the taxpayers. That seems to be a reasonable approach to me. 
So we do not disagree with the desire to save Social Security first. We only want to make sure that after Social Security has been saved, additional surpluses go back to the taxpayers. 
So with that being said, I now ask unanimous consent that there be a total of 60 minutes, and I would be willing to adjust that if there is a desire to adjust it, but we have been on this for almost 2 hours now, 60 minutes for total debate, to be equally divided between the majority leader or his designee and Senator Hollings, and following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relationship to the Lott amendment, to be followed by a vote on or in relationship to the Hollings amendment.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin this discussion, although the discussion has already proceeded. Much of what the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Wisconsin talked about, I agree with in the area of Social Security reform. There is absolutely no question but that the single, biggest fiscal policy issue facing this country today is the question of how we make the Social Security system a strong and vibrant system for generations to come and how we avoid what will be a fiscal disaster for our Nation if we do not address this issue in the near term. 
This problem is generated by the fact that we have a baby boom generation headed towards retirement. It is now turning age 50. In 15 years, it will be fully retired. In 12 years, we will begin to retire a baby boom generation that is the largest generation in the history of this country. And as that generation has moved through the system, it has affected this Nation in every decade throughout its life experience. In the 1950s, the baby boom generation created a huge need for elementary schools and baby carriages. In the 1960s, it created a tremendous restructuring of our social fabric with occurrences involving civil rights, involving rights of women, involving Vietnam. In the 1970s, we saw further impact, and in the 1980s we have seen the huge economic impact, and as we move into the 1990s, we are also seeing the impact of that generation as it begins to save for retirement and that is one of our primary reasons of this economic boom. 
But the biggest impact this generation is going to have is when it retires, and it begins to retire in the year 2008, and not unusually, or not to be unexpected, in the year 2008 the Social Security system begins to lose money. In fact, that is 
the year when we start paying out more in Social Security benefits than we are taking in. By the year 2015, the Social Security system is paying out so much more than it is taking in it basically cannot right itself. By the year 2029 or 2030, essentially the country has such a large debt and obligation under the Social Security system that it will be unable, in my opinion, to afford to maintain that system and we will face a fiscal meltdown of sorts. 
The way I describe it, it is as if we could pick a date when we know as a nation we were going to have a major earthquake, a major flood, a major hurricane come ashore, and we know that date exists and we know it is going to occur. Obviously, it would be irresponsible for us as a Congress not to react to that, not to take preventive action, not to get our people prepared for that. But we know the date when we are going to hit a fiscal crisis of inordinate proportions because the people are already born who are going to create such a huge demand on the system. That date is approximately the year 2015. 
So what should we do? We should address it today. Why should we address it today? Because, basically the sooner we address this, the sooner we can solve it in a constructive and effective way and in a positive way where everybody will end up being more of a winner than end up being a loser. It is a lot like that old oil filter ad, `You can pay me now or pay me later.' If we begin to address this problem today, we can significantly improve the system in the long run for everyone. If we wait even 2 years, certainly if we wait 4 or 5 years, the capacity to address it becomes much more acute and we go off a cliff. 
So how should we address it? The proposal we put forward in our sense-of-the-Senate is that we should address it by using the surplus first to address it, and that is absolutely right. That is what should be done. 
I would note this was not the President's position. The President said we should reserve the surplus, reserve the surplus until we have solved the Social Security problem. That is what he said in his State of the Union Address. Our position as Republicans is we should use the surplus to protect the Social Security system. And one way to do that, one way that has been proposed by myself and a number of other Members in this body, including the person sitting in the Chair, is to give people who are presently working and paying taxes into the system and who, unfortunately, are looking at a very low rate of return for all of the taxes they are paying into the system--in fact, if you just happened to go to work, say, you were 20 years old and you went to work today, the likelihood that you would get very much back from what you paid into the system in Social Security taxes is extremely low. If you happen to be an African American, actually it is a negative number. You get less back than you will pay in. 
So the system has some very serious problems in the way that it returns benefits to people who are younger today. What we have suggested is to give people today who are earning money, paying into the system, let's give them some ownership. Let's give them the ability to have an asset which they physically own as part of their Social Security retirement structure. And these are called personal accounts. 
Under the present system, what happens is, you pay in taxes all your life. And, unfortunately, let's say you died when you were 58. If you did not have a wife and you did not have children, you have nothing for all those taxes you paid in--absolutely nothing. You have absolutely no vested interest which pays your estate anything. If you had a wife or children, they might get a little bit, but not a whole lot compared to what you paid in. 
We are suggesting that some portion of the taxes that you pay into the Social Security system today you should have ownership of; you should actually, physically, have the right to claim, upon your retirement, as yours. Every year you should get a statement. You should have a little savings book, basically--I didn't bring mine with me today as an example; the Senator in the chair may have his--but you should have a savings book which says how much you have in your account at the Social Security Administration, which is yours, physically yours. No matter what happens, it cannot be taken away from you. Those are called personal accounts. Thus, if you were, unfortunately, to die before you reached the age of retirement, your estate would actually get an asset. It would get that money that was built up in that account. That is one plus of this. 
A second plus of this is that under the proposal we have, you would, essentially, get the benefit structure which Social Security gives today, but on top of that benefit structure you would be able to get the benefit of the investment of that personal account. What would that investment be in? Under the proposal we put forward, it would be in one of a variety of what amounts to mutual funds, three or four different mutual funds, which you would choose, which would be under the control and operation of the Social Security Administration, so there wouldn't be any outrageously risky investments taken. But you would have a choice. You could choose a conservative investment, you could choose a moderate investment--you could choose a moderate investment in equities. 
Why is that important? Today, the entire Social Security fund is invested in Government bonds. And what do they yield? They yield about 2.5 percent interest. Over no 20-year period in history has the equity market yielded less than 5.5 percent. So you can see the rate of return people are getting--because the average working life is 40 years--the rate of return people are getting on the amount which they are paying in Social Security taxes really is pretty weak, 2.5 percent. As I mentioned earlier, if you are an African American who happens to go into the workforce today and you are in your early twenties, your rate of return is zero--it is actually a negative number. 
But the fact is, you would have a personal account, which you would have some control over, which is invested by the Social Security Administration in probably three or four different mutual funds which you have the right to choose from but which are set up under the Social Security auspices, much like we have, in the Federal Government, the Thrift Savings Plan. If you are a Federal employee today, there is something called a Thrift Savings Plan, and the Thrift Savings Plan trustees, who work for the Federal retirement plan, set up three different options: You can choose a high-growth fund, a moderate-growth fund, or a low-growth fund--or a low-risk fund. You can put your money, your savings and your retirement, into whichever one you want. This would be the same idea under Social Security. You would get to choose which one of those funds you want to put your money in --a low-risk fund, a moderate-risk fund, a higher-risk fund. 
When you retired, you would then own that asset. The appreciation on that asset would be significantly better, we are absolutely sure, than the 2.5 percent that you are presently getting under the Social Security Administration. So that is an effective way to begin the process of making the Social Security system solvent. That would be a type of plan that would work. 
The problem, of course, is, to make this work effectively, you have to act sooner rather than later. You cannot wait for 3 or 4 years in order to put this in place, because people need time to build up the accounts. The accounts we are suggesting do not represent your entire Social Security tax. What we are suggesting is, you use 2 percent of your Social Security tax. We would basically give you a tax cut for that 2 percent. You would then be able to invest that in this retirement fund or be required to invest it in a savings fund which would be managed by the Social Security trustees and would give you a much better rate of return. 
There are a lot of other ideas out there. The point is, we need to get on to this issue, we need to get on to the specifics of how you are going to make the Social Security system solvent. 
The President has been traveling around the country. He has been talking about this. Many of us on the Republican side of the Senate have been traveling around, also talking about this. We had a bipartisan group which involved myself and Senator Breaux on the Senate side, and Congressman Stenholm and Congressman Kolbe on the House side, and a whole group of people who are expert in this area. We met for 18 months, and we put 
together an excellent plan, part of which I have outlined, which would make the system solvent for the next 100 years. But it is a plan; it is not specific legislation. So, what we need is specific legislation. 
This sense of the Senate comes forward, which essentially restates what everybody wants to do, which is make Social Security solvent. But it does not move along the plan. It doesn't move along how you get to actual legislation. If we really want to be constructive as a Senate, what we should do is probably have a sense of the Senate which calls on the President to come forward with a specific plan, and have it to us at the end of this year, so the beginning of next year we could actually begin to legislate on the Social Security system and Social Security reform, because our window of opportunity here is really quite small. If we don't put in place Social Security reform legislation by June of 1999, I am not sure we are even going to be able to put it into place, because then we are going to do a Presidential election. If it gets slid past the Presidential election, we have basically missed the window of opportunity to begin to build up equity in some kind of personal account or any sort of equity activity which involves investing in the market; we have given away 2 years of opportunity for that type of investment activity. 
So, what we really need is specific action. Another sense of the Senate is nice. It is very appropriate, I suppose, to keep making this point over and over again, so it does not end up being overly politicized. But the fact is, what we need to do is go from the sense of the Senate situation to specifics. 
What is the difference between the two sense of the Senate amendments here? I am not sure the differences are all that substantive, to be very honest with you. Where the difference is, essentially, is in the third point: `save Social Security first by reserving any surpluses in fiscal year 1999 budget legislation.' Our sense of the Senate adds a fourth item: Third, `save Social Security first,' which we all agree on, and, fourth, `return all remaining surpluses to the American taxpayers.' 
So we take it a step further. We basically add another point to the sense of the Senate by saying, once you have saved Social Security, let's take the other part, the surplus that is left over--there may not be any, but hopefully there will be--and return it to the American taxpayer. 
I would say this language, `save Social Security first by reserving any surplus in the fiscal year 1999 budget legislation,' is a little confusing, because fiscal year 1999 budget legislation could either mean the year 1999 or it could mean the 5-year period that budget legislation covers. So it is not really clear to me exactly what surplus they are talking about here. Is it a 1-year surplus or is it a 5-year surplus? 
In any event, what we are saying is, independent of that issue, let's save Social Security first. But if there is a surplus above saving Social Security, let's do the right thing with it; let's return it to the taxpayer. 
Who can disagree with that? We don't want to spend it, that is for sure. We might want to use it to reduce debt, but of course the best way to reduce debt is to save Social Security. Once you have saved Social Security, you have significantly reduced debt, dramatically reduced debt, because the biggest debt the Federal Government owes is to the Social Security system. So let's take that extra money, if there is any, and return it to the American taxpayer. 
I think our sense of the Senate maybe takes the Hollings sense of the Senate, which was a good attempt, good statement on its face, in many ways, and makes it a lot stronger, because it makes it absolutely clear that not only do we want to save Social Security but we also want to return any extra surplus, after we have saved Social Security, to the American taxpayer.

<TEXT>
Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I just wanted to return to the specifics of the resolution, because I do think it is important to note that the resolution put forward by the Democratic membership is a resolution which tracks the statements made by the President in his State of the Union Address, which were that we should save Social Security first, we should reserve the surplus until we have saved Social Security first. 
That is a paraphrase, but I think it is an accurate paraphrase. In other words, the President did not say, `We shall use the surplus to save Social Security.' No, he chose his words very precisely. He said, `We would reserve the surplus until Social Security is saved.' If you look at this proposal brought forward by the Democratic leadership, it says, `Save Social Security first by reserving any surplus.' It doesn't say the surplus is going to be used. It says they are going to reserve it, again. 
What is the difference here? We are saying use the surplus to save Social Security. They are saying reserve the surplus until Social Security has been saved. So all of the arguments they have made relative to the surplus and how it ties into the need to have the surplus for the purposes of benefiting the Social Security system really are not supported by the terms and specifics of their language because they are not even saying they intend to use the surplus to save Social Security. They are saying they are going to reserve the surplus until Social Security is saved, which leads one to the conclusion that maybe what they are planning is some change, some horrific change to the Social Security system where they are going to cut benefits and slash here and slash there so that they can pump up the surplus and have saved the Social Security system and still have a surplus to spend. 
You can read their language to say that. You can't read our language to say that. Our language says, `Use the surplus to save Social Security.' So the histrionics around here are a bit much, and I don't know what they mean. I don't know what they mean when they say `reserve.' I don't know what they mean when they say, `The surpluses in the year 1999 budget legislation' because that doesn't necessarily mean the year 1999. That could mean the next 5 years, for all I know, that the budget legislation expires. 
So this is a resolution that is, to be kind, imprecisely drafted, or maybe it isn't imprecisely drafted. Maybe they intended to obfuscate the issue by using the term `reserve,' obfuscate the issue by using the term `1999 budget legislation.' We do not obfuscate the issue. We say, `Save Social Security first,' period. None of this qualifying language about reserving anything. And then we say, and we don't obfuscate this either, to the extent that there remains a surplus, `Give it back to the American taxpayers.' Give them a tax cut. Across this country in State legislatures where the surpluses are being added up--along with our Federal surplus, most States are running surpluses --we are seeing tax cut after tax cut because the States understand that they are taking in more than the government needs. You shouldn't spend it. You shouldn't create new programs. You should return it to the taxpayers. 
Now, the Senator from South Carolina has spent a considerable 
amount of time--in fact, he was kind enough to give me his numbers, and they are very nice numbers, presented very nicely, well formatted--on how there is no surplus out there besides the Social Security surplus. Well, I know the Senator from South Carolina is a student of the budget. In fact, he is one of the most knowledgeable people around here. I would simply refer him to the CBO numbers which say in the outyears there is a surplus independent of the Social Security system, independent of the Social Security system. In other words, there is a surplus beginning in the year 2005, which is a surplus that is not generated in any relationship to the surplus in the Social Security trust fund, and in 2006, in 2007, and in 2008, and beyond that maybe--we hope. But in any event, over that 4-year period, and that adds up to almost, by my calculations, $150 billion of surplus, which is an onbudget surplus generated not by the Social Security surplus but generated after you have taken into account Social Security payments. 
So the CBO is telling us there is a distinct potential for there to be a surplus which has nothing to do with the Social Security trust funds. Not only is there a potential; they say there is going to be one, specifically saying. So I believe the Senator from South Carolina has misspoken on that point, or I disagree with his position on that point. He may not have misspoken. I am disagreeing with his position, because I am looking at the CBO July update which says there is a surplus. 
Should we use that surplus for something other than Social Security? My own personal opinion is no. No. The onbudget surplus, that I just talked about, should probably be also used for the purposes of addressing the Social Security issue. That happens to be my personal position. The way it should be done is by cutting taxes, which is what we happen to mention here in our amendment. We should cut taxes. 
What tax should we cut? We should cut the Social Security tax. Why? Because it is the most regressive tax which we have. It is assessed across the board. Every wage earner pays it, and it is extraordinarily high. In fact, for most wage earners in America today, the Social Security tax is higher than their income tax. And it has no relationship to your total income; it simply is applied to your wage base. So it should be cut. 
That is our proposal. It happens to be a bipartisan proposal. In fact, I think it now has something like seven or eight sponsors almost evenly divided between the Democrat and Republican side of the aisle here. And what we propose is to cut the Social Security tax by 2 percent, allow people to take that money, invest it in a savings vehicle managed by the Social Security Administration, which will give them a better return and give them physical ownership of that asset as we have discussed earlier. 
So substantively I believe the proposal that I have brought forward here that is cosponsored by Senator Lott, Senator Domenici, Senator Gramm, and Senator Mack is a better idea. It says, `Save Social Security,' period. That has to be done. It has to be done first. And then if there is a surplus, let's return it to the American taxpayer. It doesn't say there will definitely be a surplus, but if we look at the CBO numbers, we know there is a distinct possibility that there will be a surplus because they are scoring one for us. It does not obfuscate the issue with words like `reserve' and words like `fiscal year 1999 budget legislation.' Pretty blunt. 
So I think if the membership wants to choose a clear, concise, specific statement that says Social Security will be saved and will be saved first, and that then we will look at cutting taxes for the American taxpayer, they will want to choose the amendment offered by myself. If they wish to choose an amendment which is a little more opaque in its presentation and does not address the issue of cutting taxes, then they will choose one presented by the Democratic leadership.

We can spend the entire day here debating what the CBO means when it puts a surplus number out which says an on-budget surplus number. But the numbers are there. The Senator said find me a place where we can show a surplus. I found him a place. He wants to try to talk now about gross debt--

Mr. GREGG. No, we are not using Social Security. If I may restate the point, CBO numbers, which came out on July 15, showed fairly definitively that there is a surplus, independent of the Social Security trust fund, of approximately $169 billion. 
The Senator may not accept those numbers. He may not like those numbers. He may feel those numbers are inaccurately, inappropriately arrived at. But those are the numbers which we have been given. Which leads to the secondary point, because the numbers are really almost irrelevant to the debate. It leads to the secondary point here, which is the key point, which is that there is a potential to give the American taxpayers a tax cut. Let's give it to them. Let's lock in the statement, `We want to give a tax cut, if there is a surplus in excess of what we need to benefit the Social Security system and make it solvent.' 
Why would we walk away from the opportunity to say to the American taxpayer, `If we can make the Social Security system solvent, after we have done that, if we have extra money, we are going to give you a tax cut?' Why would we ever want to walk away from such a statement? I think it is a fairly reasonable statement, a clear statement, concise statement, unlike the statement from the Democratic leadership which is totally--which is very hard to understand because it uses terms like `reserve,' uses terms like `fiscal year 1999 budget legislation,' both of which are terms of art and which are very hard to understand, would be very hard to even get a legal definition of, much less a commonsense definition of.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the next amendments in order, subject to relevant second degrees, and that following debate, each amendment be laid aside to reoccur at 9:30 this evening in a stacked sequence in the order in which they were debated. 
I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes prior to each vote for closing remarks. 
The amendments are: 
The pending McCain amendment, a Durbin amendment on guns, a Thompson amendment on federalism, a Bumpers amendment on telephone privacy, a Nickles amendment on defenders, a Feingold amendment on child exploitation, and a Kyl-Craig amendment on gaming.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, so my colleagues know where we stand--and I certainly thank the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Idaho for their timely discussion of what was a fairly complicated issue; both Senator Hollings and I greatly appreciate their courtesy in moving debate along--we are now waiting for Senator Thompson, who I understand is on the way to the floor to offer his amendment. Then we will go to Senator Bumpers. We will probably be skipping over the amendment by Senator Nickles. As I understand it, he is not available until probably 9 or 9:15. So we will go to Senator Feingold after Senator Bumpers. 
That is the order we are proceeding under, under the previous unanimous consent. As soon as Senator Thompson arrives, we shall take up his amendment. 
I make a point of order a quorum is not present.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin to address this issue. I know Senator Hollings is on his way to the floor, the ranking Democrat, who has worked so conscientiously on this, along with his staff and my staff. This is the appropriations bill which covers some very core agencies that the Federal Government has responsibility for, specifically areas of Justice, things like the FBI, the DEA, the INS; areas within Commerce--many areas, of course, are covered by the Commerce Department including, of course, the census issue. Equally important, in fact more important in many ways are ITA and NOAA, two agencies that deal with the manner in which the U.S. economy functions and the manner in which our environment is reviewed. We try to stay ahead of weather conditions. 
In addition, this bill has the State Department--obviously the State Department is a core function of the Federal activity--and the judiciary, which is the third branch of the Government, that is also under this bill, along with a number of independent agencies, agencies like the FCC and the FTC and the Small Business Administration. So this is a bill that has broad reach and is a very significant item for the Senate to take up. 
This funding bill has been put together as a result of the hard work of a lot of people. I especially thank my ranking member, Senator Hollings, whose input and assistance is always invaluable on this issue. His background and knowledge of the questions which are raised on this bill are extraordinary. I look to him for advice and counsel on many issues. When we agree, we make great progress, which we have on this bill. This bill was reported out of the committee unanimously. 
In addition, I thank my staff which has worked so hard, and minority staff which has worked so hard, and the other members of the committee.

<TEXT>
Mr. GREGG. That request also included members of the minority staff. 
Mr. President, this bill, S. 2260, is, as I mentioned, a bipartisan bill. It was reported out of committee unanimously. It is a bill that allocates $33.2 billion for fiscal year 1999. The bill provides $1.1 billion more than was spent on these agencies last year. I will explain the reasons for those increases as we go on. It is $3.6 billion less than what the President requested. 
It is a lean bill. There were difficult decisions that had to be made. But the legislation supports the core functions which are required of these agencies while improving a number of activities pursued by these agencies. 
We provide $17.8 billion for the Justice Department. This includes funds to combat terrorism, violence against women and children, illegal drug running, and cybercrime, along with many other worthwhile programs. 
I am proud to say the committee included a total of $17.2 million to bolster programs that help law enforcers find and care for missing children. This bill furthers our goals of making communities safer for our children. 
You may recall last year the committee increased funding for the FBI and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to prevent the use of the Internet to exploit children. Based on the follow-up hearings we held this year, I believe those funds have been put to good use. The Center was involved in recovering 4,878 children this year with an overall recovery rate of 90.3 percent. The Center increased the hours of operation for their phone tip hotline and created a web site on the Internet for public use. The hotline, in conjunction with the web site, should lead to more pedophile apprehension. The Center also provides special training for local law enforcement people at the Jimmy Ryce Law Enforcement Training Center about how to pursue missing children. This is a serious issue, missing children, and we are trying to address it aggressively in this bill. 
As part of this effort, we have recommended $5.2 million for the FBI to combat child abductions and serial killing. 
The FBI has put together an exceptional task force to address the issue of child abductions and serial killings. 
The tragic school shootings in the past few months that have shocked the Nation are also a concern of ours. According to the National School Safety Center, 25 students have been killed in U.S. schools since January 1 of this year. This is the same number of students who were killed for the full 1996 school year, but in half the time. 
For this reason, the Senator from South Carolina and I created a new Safe Schools Initiative which provides $210 million to introduce a positive law enforcement presence in our school systems. By working together with educators and local communities, we believe law enforcers can find ways to stop the escalation of murders and violence in our schools. The funding is found in three Department of Justice accounts: $175 million from Community Orientated Policing (COPS) for additional officers; $25 million for the Juvenile At-Risk Children's Program for prevention efforts; and $10 million from the National Institute of Justice to develop new, more effective safety technologies. These funds will be used by local law enforcers in partnership with schools and communities to develop programs to improve safety in our schools. 
I congratulate and appreciate the support of the Senator from South Carolina in developing this new initiative. Our intention is to provide educators with the means to improve hostile environments. We must make sure that violence does not become a commonplace event in our school systems. 
In addition to this new Safe Schools Initiative, we fund many of the out-of-school programs for children that will likely be familiar to you. We increase funding for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, for the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program which brings young people together with responsible adults willing to serve as long-term mentors. These programs give students positive reinforcement while expanding their horizons while taking up those hours of the day when students are most at risk --the time right after school. 
There are prevention programs, such as the National Crime Prevention Council, whose well known mascots of McGruff and Scruff make learning safety tips fun, or Parents Anonymous which advocates prevention of child abuse and which will be creating an immediate-response system with the fiscal year 1999 funding. 
Many States have youth programs tailored to their communities, and these communities may be eligible for Federal grants to assist in the areas of education, research, prevention, and rehabilitation. These are the types of programs the committee is supporting by placing $284 million in the juvenile justice programs account. 
I stress here that we have not tried to reinvent the wheel. We have supported programs that work, and we have turned to communities to give us their ideas as to how these funds should be allocated. 
Also in line with youth support, the committee is recommending $12 million to expand the Youth Gang Program and $95 million for incentive grants for local delinquency programs, including $25 million to enforce underage drinking laws. 
Most of the programs I have mentioned are prevention programs to work with youth, but there is more to this process. The committee, with help from the chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Youth Violence, added $100 million for the juvenile accountable incentive block grant. These funds will go towards functions that are in place to emphasize accountability to juveniles after they have committed crimes, such as detention facilities and probation officers. 
The committee recommends an increase to $282 million for the Violence Against Women Program. According to the Justice Department, violence by an intimate accounts for 21 percent of the violent crime experienced by women. Our legislation increases the number of law enforcers and prosecutors who will address these crimes. Our intent is to develop and implement effective arrest 
and prosecution policies in order to provide better handling of crimes against women. Women ages 16 to 24 experience the highest per capita crime rates of intimate violence. Therefore, the committee is providing $10 million within the funding level for the prevention of violence on college campuses. By doing so, we will be helping the women who are most at risk. 
Many of our colleagues are familiar with the story of Megan Kanka who was killed by her neighbor, a convicted sex offender, in New Jersey in 1994. Congress subsequently passed Megan's law that asks States to require its violent sex offenders to register their address with government officials upon their release from prison. To further this effort, this bill contains $25 million for the National Sex Offender Registry to identify, collect, and exchange sex offender data from the States through an automated registry. 
Further, the bill includes $45 million to assist States in improving the automation, accuracy, and completeness of criminal history records. This will facilitate the exchange of interstate information. 
In addition, we add money for the DNA programs so that States will be able to communicate effectively with each other on the issues of DNA. 
The balance that we tried to reach was between those areas of prevention where we can assist children, especially children in school, and give them leadership when they are out of school during those difficult hours, with the need to have a tough enforcement process, and that enforcement process has been adequately funded and aggressively funded as a result, in large part, of the Senator who is sitting in the Chair right now whose leadership on the issues of juvenile justice is primary in this body. 
Another area of Justice activity we have addressed is the terrorism issue. Terrorism continues to be a primary concern and threat to our country, so the committee is continuing to support a strong counterterrorism policy, something we began a couple of years ago with the work of Senator Hollings and myself. 
The Attorney General is working on a counterterrorism strategy that should be completed by the end of the year. We look forward to the completion of that plan, and we are recommending $224 million for counterterrorism initiatives. 
Our counterterrorism recommendation is comprehensive. A portion of this funding will go to the first-responder training and equipment as the Nation must be able to quickly react to a terrorist incident. Another portion will provide funding for specific programs to build this capacity, such as metropolitan medical strike team training and equipment, the acquisition of equipment for the largest cities and localities in the United States, the implementation of situational exercises, State and local bomb detection and technician equipment, and equipment grants for local fire and emergency agencies. The intent of the committee is to provide direct assistance to the first responders as well as to guide our national policy toward a coordinated and effective response. 
We also recommend significant funding for State and local law enforcers to have the same training and equipment as their Federal counterparts. The committee recognizes the need for the Federal, State, and local law enforcers to work together, especially in addressing a terrorist attack. 
We provide funding for the FBI to prepare for terrorist attacks. The issue of terrorism is a two-fold event--one of trying to stop it and anticipate it through intelligence and, second, trying to react when such an unfortunate incident occurs. We have aggressively funded the FBI initiatives. 
As part of the counterterrorism effort, we enable the Attorney General to quickly receive reimbursements from other agencies as well as to acquire the necessary equipment and services during a terrorist crisis. 
We have further requested the Attorney General to conduct a no-notice, counterterrorism-readiness exercise involving the leadership of all pertinent agencies. We look forward to the results of that exercise. 
This is just a brief summary of some of the elements of our counterterrorism strategy. Obviously, some parts of it have to remain classified, but our purpose is to have a comprehensive, all-encompassing response to what is clearly one of the biggest issues facing our country. 
Are we prepared for a terrorist attack at this time? No, we are not. Are we moving in the right direction to get prepared for such an attack? Yes, we are. Having visited almost all the agencies that are involved, those that are in our purview of jurisdiction and those outside our purview of jurisdiction, the one thing I have been most impressed with is a sincere and genuine effort to have a coordinated response to this issue, and there appears to be very little in the way of a turf fight going on, which is absolutely critical that we avoid in trying to address this issue. 
In the area of drugs, we also have a major effort. The strategy includes $24 million for DEA's methamphetamine initiative and $13 million for the heroin strategy. To also combat methamphetamine production and trafficking, we are recommending a $15.5 million methamphetamine program through the COPS program. 
The Senator from South Carolina and I have worked with the DEA Administrator to create regional drug enforcement teams to address the strategies of the cartels. The committee directs $21.8 million for this effort, and there is an additional $5.6 million provided to handle the influx of violent drug-trafficking groups based in the Caribbean. 
We included also $25 million for S. 1605, the `Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act,' sponsored by my friend and colleague from Colorado, Senator Campbell, and signed by the President on June 16. This funding will go to law enforcement officers for the purchase of bulletproof vests. 
The committee recommends a new initiative which provides $144 million to improve law enforcement in Native American communities. The funds come from a variety of agencies. However, we have seen, unfortunately, that adequate law enforcement in Native American communities is woefully lacking, and there are a number of initiatives which we have undertaken in this bill to try to assist those communities. 
In the area of the INS, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, this bill provides $3.9 billion. We want to equip the INS with the means to manage its two-pronged duty of law enforcement and legal immigration. On the enforcement end, we are recommending an additional 1,000 Border Patrol agents for the borders and a 100-person integrated team designed to intercept illegal aliens traveling on highways in the South and Midwest in order to counteract problems arising in the interior of the country. 
When we take these 1,000 agents and add them on top of the 1,000 agents we put in last year, we are making a huge personnel expansion in the INS in the area of the Border Patrol where the problem exists. 
For the second prong, the administrative portion, we provide sufficient funding that is enhanced by technology. The INS construction and maintenance has been woefully under funded in the past years, and we recommend more than a 33 percent increase. The $110 million level will strengthen training, border control, and detention and deportation. 
Detention space shortfalls and the naturalization backlog will benefit from the increased revenues from revived fees. Where possible, new technology should ease the burden on our overworked personnel. 
Of note, this bill does not address the INS reform issue. Reform is needed in that agency, but it is too complex an issue to address in the context of this appropriations bill. Clearly, it needs to be addressed in the future and, hopefully, in the near term. 
In the Commerce Department we have provided $4.9 billion. The committee provides funding requested by the President for the U.S. Trade Representative and the International Trade Commission, and a variety of other international trade activities, including ITA, at funding levels which are more than adequate to address the concerns in trade which are so critical to strong commerce. Commerce Department programs are supported specifically at a level that will adequately do the job that is required. 
In the area of the census, we have put in $848 million, over a half-million dollars. This is the amount that was requested. We have not addressed the issue of the question of the proper way to count the census. The decennial census is important not just for the apportionment of Representatives in the House of Representatives but for many of the formulas that create grants to the States. 
The dress rehearsal for the census raised several issues which deserve congressional scrutiny. This occurred recently in two cities in the United States. Going into the dress rehearsal, the 
Census Bureau did not have in place software which could detect duplicate or fraudulent census forms. The inability of the Bureau to test such an important system during the dress rehearsal is troubling. 
The keystone of any census is the mailing list. In this bill, additional funds are provided to assist the Bureau in `re-engineering' its mailing list. The forms returned as `undeliverable as addressed' during the rehearsal were twice the number estimated by the Census Bureau. Mailing list problems varied in three locations in which the dress rehearsal was conducted. 
The purpose of the dress rehearsal is, of course, to identify shortcomings which must be corrected in order for the decennial census to be successful. The Census Bureau is behind in its efforts to create its Master Address File for the decennial census. Also, reports of mail address problems from the dress rehearsal do nothing to increase the confidence that the address list `re-engineering' will be successful. During the dress rehearsal, maps for enumerators to follow up with those not responding to the census were found to be hard to read and, in some instances, inaccurate. 
A successful census will require a good mailing list, a way to detect fraudulent or duplicate forms, and maps to permit enumerators to follow up on nonresponsive citizens. We will spend billions of dollars on the year 2000 census. We should expect these basic elements to be in place for the dress rehearsal. They were not, and this should concern every Senator. 
We need to know what is going to happen with the census when it occurs. Clearly, there is a fight going on over whether there should be sampling. But one thing is obviously clear from the dress rehearsal: Whether there was sampling or whether there was not sampling--whether there was a head count or not--the census is not ready to go forward and a lot needs to be done. 
The bill funds the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) programs at a level of $646.7 million. This level will enable NIST to upgrade its facilities and to build a state-of-the-art Advanced Measurement Laboratory. NIST's activities are actually critical to American industry. They are especially important now where exporters are running into trade barriers which are sometimes technically applied to them, and this can assist them in being more responsive to these technical barriers. 
The committee also funds the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at $2.2 billion. This exceeds the requested level. This committee is totally committed to being sure that we have a first-class NOAA effort. Clearly, in light of what we have seen from El Nino and other weather events in this country in recent times, it is absolutely critical that we have a strong Weather Service. And the need to expand our activity in the area of ocean activities is also equally critical. 
NOAA advises us that they are getting near to the ability to adequately forecast an El Nino type of event, and we intend to make sure they have the funds to accomplish that. In addition, this year's budget request includes the Advanced Hydrological Prediction System, which should assist in forecasting floods in the Missouri flood basin, an absolutely critical issue, as well as the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System which the National Weather Service needs. 
Further, we have created a new Oceans Policy Commission. This is basically the outgrowth of an initiative of, again, the Senator from South Carolina. As some may recall, NOAA was initially created under the Nixon administration by Executive order. The idea for an agency to conduct research on oceans and atmosphere came as an outgrowth of the Stratton Commission, which was created in the 1960s. I think it is fair to say that the Senator from South Carolina and I believe the time has come to reinvigorate and assess the state of U.S. ocean policy and research. This commission will accomplish that. 
In the area of the State Department and its related agencies, we have provided $5.6 billion. We are totally committed to modernizing the information technology and facilities, and especially housing, of the State Department. The committee recommended $118 million, the full request, for computers and communications equipment. This funding is an essential part of achieving the year 2000 compliance. Another $5 million is provided for systems unique to the United States Information Agency. And $550 million, approximately, is provided for the security and maintenance account, and $52.9 million is allocated for desperately needed housing. Finally, we fund the design of two new chanceries in Beijing and Berlin and anticipate funding the construction in next year's bill. 
As for the international accounts, the committee recommends $1.1 billion for international organizations and $431 million for peacekeeping. Though the administration did not request it, the committee recommendation includes $475 million for arrears. The $475 million is consistent with the State Department authorization bill and the 1998 budget resolution. This year's payment brings the total available for arrears to $575 million. That is the amount that the U.N. requested. And we are on course to full funding of the arrears. With a stroke of the pen, the President can restore the credibility of the United States at the U.N. by simply signing the appropriate legislation --specifically, the State Department authorization bill which was agreed to. So the Congress has done its part and continues to do its part on funding the arrears issue. 
The problem lies with the White House. 
Finally, because of the crisis in India and Pakistan, we fully fund the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. 
In the area of the Judiciary, out of a total of $3.6 billion, we recommended full funding for the Judiciary's highest priorities: court security, defender services, and the Supreme Court. The remaining accounts receive increases across the board, although not all at levels that they were requested. We also include a cost-of-living adjustment for the justices and the judges. 
We, as I mentioned, have a number of independent agencies. In regard to the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), we are funding that at the levels they requested. However, there remains the issue of the Portals II building. I am sure there will be considerable discussion of that before we complete this bill, but the fact is that there has been gross mismanagement relative to the Portal II building. The FCC should not be forced into moving into a building that does not meet its requirements from the standpoint of technology or security, and that building is really a total affront to the taxpayers of this country--that being the fact that we continue to pay for uninhabited space which is uninhabitable space as well as being uninhabited. 
In the Federal Trade Commission, we have aggressively worked with the leadership of the Federal Trade Commission, Chairman Pitofsky, to pursue an aggressive program on telemarketing fraud. Consumers lose anywhere from $3 billion to up to $40 billion a year as a result of telemarketing fraud. We are seeing a great expansion of this activity, especially on the Internet. The committee is working with the Commission and has set up a new program to try to address this, including an 800 number. The Commission feels quite confident this will have a significant impact on the problem. 
The Small Business Administration is also funded at a high level, $613 billion. Of this, $240.8 million goes to business loans and $94 million goes for the disaster loan account. 
Of concern to the committee is the administration's request to increase the disaster loan interest rate. This request was soundly rejected. The committee has made it clear to the SBA and the administration that increasing the interest rates on loans to Americans who have experienced disasters is unacceptable. The administration should reverse its ill-considered proposal to make disaster victims pay market rates for assistance in recovering from economic injury. 
I thank the Senator from South Carolina for his strong assistance in helping with this bill. There is a great deal more to talk about, and I am sure we will have plenty of time to do that as we proceed forward. 
I thank the Senator from South Carolina for his courtesy for that long statement. I understand we may break at 12:30, so he may want to reserve his statement.

Mr. GREGG. I would like very much to restore funding for this program--and for other exchanges as well. Unfortunately we are operating under tight budgetary constraints. As the senior Senator from Indiana knows, the number of international exchange programs have grown over the years and that is a reflection of their popularity and importance. Overall appropriations have not kept pace with the growth in the number of programs. The regrettable result of this shrinkage of funds and growth in demand for them means that some programs must be reduced. 
But, I very much appreciate the Senator's strong argument in support of the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange program, particularly the foreign policy role it plays in strengthening our ties with an important European ally, Germany. I will keep your arguments very much before me when we negotiate with our House counterparts in conference.

Mr. GREGG. I appreciate both Senators' concerns on this subject. Although I see how it might be possible to read this into the Committee's Report, this is not the Committee's intent. The Department of Justice, like all Executive Agencies, is to develop a meaningful strategic plan and performance measures under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). In so doing, the Committee wants to be certain that these GPRA efforts are consistent with the National Drug Control Strategy and the ONDCP's Performance Measures of Effectiveness System (PME). The Department of Justice must demonstrate how its own drug programs contribute to the achievement of outcomes articulated in the ONDCP's PME system. To ensure this, the Attorney General must work closely with ONDCP on the further implementation of the National Drug Control Strategy and PME system, particularly by linking its drug control budget resources to the outcomes articulated by the PME system. The Justice Department should also consult with other departments with expertise in particular drug control areas, to the extent that it needs assistance in meeting PME system goals.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida has brought forward a very good amendment. It is our hope we could agree to it. At this time, because of the potential of a CBO scoring which could impact the underlying bill, it is impossible for us to do so. So our proposal would be we keep this on the list for a vote tomorrow morning, and if we have not gotten the proper response we are comfortable with from CBO, we can take the issue up at that time and try to resolve it at that point.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, even though it has nothing to do with this bill, I would like to congratulate the Senator from Minnesota for his truly superb analysis of the Social Security issue and especially the information he brings to this Senate relative to other countries that have pursued reform of their pension programs. 
There is no question but if there is a single issue of fiscal policy which most threatens this country's economic well-being in the future and, as a result, threatens our well-being today, it is the Social Security crisis. That occurs as a function of demographics; beginning in the year 2008, the Social Security system in this country pays more out than it is taking in. It begins that cost expansion dramatically as it moves into the period 2015, and by the year 2029-2030 the system is bankrupt and the Nation is unable to afford the costs of it. 
It is absolutely essential that we guarantee our children and the postwar baby-boom generation which is about to go into the system a chance to have a viable Social Security system. 
Some of the ideas the Senator from Minnesota has outlined are excellent approaches to this. I congratulate him, obviously, for the intensity of thought and energy he has put into this issue. I hope he will take an opportunity to review a bill which I have cosponsored along with Senator Breaux from Louisiana to try to address this, which bill provides long-term solvency for the next 100 years. I include some of the ideas outlined by the Senator from Minnesota. 
In any event, the thoughts of the Senator from Minnesota were extremely insightful and very appropriate, and I hope people have a chance to read them and review them as we go forward. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the body an issue which is percolating under the surface as we move toward the end of this week; that is, the question of the financing of the Teamsters Union elections which were financed by tax dollars, and which elections may be held again for which there has been a request to finance them again with tax dollars. 
The last time we went down this road, the Teamsters Union ran an election which was overseen by the U.S. attorney in New York with the assistance of the Justice Department. And the U.S. Marshals I believe were also involved in it. The taxpayers of this country spent $17 million to oversee this election. The election was then reviewed. It was determined that the election had been fraudulently run, that it had corruptly proceeded, and that it was basically an election which had to be voided by the Federal judge who was overseeing the election. 
So for the $17 million of tax money which we invested in order to get a fair and honest election in the Teamsters Union, the taxpayers got a dishonest, corrupt, and fraudulent election. 
That is bad enough. What is even worse is that the taxpayers had to pay in the first place to oversee a union election. 
This is the largest union in the United States, I believe, relative to membership. It is a very wealthy union. It is obviously a union which has had some significant problems over the years, both with its leadership and with the management, and especially with its pension funds for its rank and file. But it clearly is a union which has the financial strength to pay the cost of oversight of its elections to assure that the rank-and-file membership of the union get a fair and honest election. 
I personally felt sorry for the membership of the Teamsters Union which has been put through this election which has been so fraudulently managed. But I also think that the taxpayers have to be concerned. We have to be concerned about the taxpayers. Why should the taxpayers of this country be asked to pay for the cost of overseeing a union election for a union which is so wealthy? Clearly, for any oversight that occurs, the cost should be borne by the union itself. I should think it would want to in order to obtain an honest and fair election. But no, that didn't happen. 
In the last election, the taxpayers came up with $17 million, which was clearly wasted. Have we been reimbursed for that? Have the taxpayers been reimbursed for that $17 million? No, we haven't. I realize that in Washington $17 million seems like a meager sum, but I have to tell you, it is a lot of money. 
There are a lot of people in New Hampshire both who are 
union members and who are nonunion members, who work very hard and who work all year long to pay their taxes. And if you were to add up their taxes, you would find it didn't meet $17 million. I suspect that is probably for 5,000 or 6,000 people in the State of New Hampshire the tax burden for a year. I am not sure. That is a guess. But I suspect it is a large number of people who work all year paying their taxes so they can be put into this union election, which is then fraudulently run. And we didn't get the money back. 
Now they come to us again. They say, `We need another--we don't know what the final figure might be.' But initially they need another $8 million of tax money in order to run this second election. Fool me once, and it is your fault. Fool me twice, and it is my fault. Clearly, it is the taxpayer who is being taken down the road. If the Congress allows this to happen again, it is the Congress that is being taken down the road, and as a result we are not carrying out our obligation to support the taxpayers. 
So for us to pay another $8 million--it may end up being much more than that. It may be $20 million in order to support another union election after we haven't been reimbursed for the $17 million we spent in the last election, which was basically totally mismanaged. It is inconceivable. It is inappropriate. It makes no sense. Fortunately, that is my view. Unfortunately, there are a number of people around here who have a different view. 
The White House wants us to spend this money. The Justice Department wants us to spend this money. The Speaker of the House wants to spend, I guess, this money. A number of Members of our own body want to spend this money. But to get this money, they have to, at least in theory, come to the committee that I chair and get me to authorize and reprogram to do it. 
I want to go on record as to why I am not doing it. I am not going to reauthorize that reprogram because I am not going to go back to New Hampshire and be walking through a factory somewhere, or on a farm somewhere, or in a small software company somewhere, and have one of my constituents come up to me and say, `You know, last year I paid X dollars in taxes, and you just sent it to run a corrupt election for the Teamsters. What are you doing with my money? Aren't you supposed to be taking care of that money down there? Aren't you supposed to be my fiduciary? Aren't you supposed to be overseeing it so it doesn't get wasted?' 
If I approve this transfer, my answer to them would have to be, I am not doing my job, that I am not fulfilling my obligation to protect the taxpayers from the fraudulent misuse of their funds. 
The Teamsters Union has the financial wherewithal to pay the cost of overseeing its own elections. The last election was such an abysmal failure from the standpoint of integrity, from the standpoint of appropriateness of an election process, that it is absolutely inexcusable that the Court, that the Justice Department, that the White House, or that anyone else would come to us again and say, Taxpayers, we are going to go down this road one more time. 
We are going to take you on this ride one more time. We are going to spend your money one more time to run another election for a union which has proven itself to be so corrupt in the manner in which it runs elections.' It is just beyond my comprehension how we can pursue that course of action. But that seems to be the desire of a number of members in this body and a number of members of the other body, of the White House and of the leadership of the Justice Department. However, if they are going to do it, they are going to do it without my support, and I will do everything I can in this body to make sure that those tax dollars are not spent in this way. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. President I suggest the absence of a quorum.

<TEXT>
 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I introduce--I believe I can say without exaggeration--a landmark piece of legislation, the Twenty-First Century Retirement Act. 
Joining me as principal co-sponsor of this legislation is Senator John Breaux, with whom I served as co-chair of the National Commission on Retirement Policy during the last year. Also this week, the same legislation will be introduced by our House colleagues, Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Charles Stenholm. 
With many pieces of legislation, naming the cosponsors upon introduction is merely a perfunctory exercise. With this one, it is significant. Also as original cosponsors of this legislation, we have Senators Fred Thompson, Chuck Robb, Craig Thomas, and Dan Coats. Several cosponsors from both sides of the aisle are also joining on the House bill. 
This in and of itself is almost an unprecedented accomplishment. This simply does not happen with Social Security, long considered the `third rail' of American politics. We are turning this `third rail' into a passenger train--a bipartisan, bicameral process for reform. 
Two months ago, the National Commission on Retirement Policy voted 24-0 to approve the recommendations that this legislation would implement. Today we are introducing it with several cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. Given the difficulty that most experts see with restoring the Social Security system to balance, our proposal has set a modern record for the most support attracted to any proposal to place Social Security on sound long-term footing. 
For several years, we have seen numerous Commissions divide among themselves, breaking into factions, issuing separate minority opinions instead of coming to agreement. We have seen various--many of them visionary and constructive--individual legislators introduce reform proposals that could attract little support beyond the original co-sponsors. But today we stand here with a proposal that has received endorsements that have not been given to other Social Security proposals in recent years. 
What have we done that has enabled us to build such support? 
The first thing we did was to take careful note of what Social Security has meant to Americans, and what they insist that it mean in the future. Social Security has long been the principal government program lifting senior citizens out of poverty. In addition to providing a basic level of protection against poverty, the program has also been sold to Americans as not a welfare program, but rather a program under which benefits paid will bear a reasonable relationship to the contributions that people have put in. 
So we set about to ensure that this remained the case. We wanted to have a system that, in the end, would do an even better job of lifting Americans out of poverty--and would, at the same time, ensure that people received a fair deal for the investment that they made in the program. 
Let me step back a bit, Mr. President, and review why action is necessary to achieve this purpose. This requires me to review the projections for Social Security under current law. 
It is often said that Social Security faces an actuarial problem. It is said that the program is solvent only through the year 2032. That is true. But it does not begin to describe all of the problems with the program. 
Even an actuarially sound Social Security program would face enormous financing problems under its current structure. It is a `pay as you go' system. Any surplus assets it holds are invested in the federal government--which then has to pay it back at some date in the future. So, even if the books were balanced--and they are trillions of dollars out of balance--the general taxpayer would still face the problem of paying off more than $4 trillion in Trust Fund assets. This would be needed above and beyond payroll taxes (!) in order to pay the benefits that have been promised to the baby boom generation of retirees. 
So what would that mean? It would mean raising taxes on future generations of Americans. The payroll tax would ultimately have to go up by almost 50%! That is because the net cost of the system would ultimately top 18% of payroll, as opposed to today's 12.4% tax rate. 
Raising the FICA tax today, immediately, by 2.2% of payroll, would not solve this problem. It would just mean that future taxpayers would have a larger Trust Fund to pay off later on, and that the 50% payroll tax increase would be borne indirectly, through general taxation. 
But there would be another dire effect of such a change. Under current law, rates of return under Social Security are dropping. If you are a single male, the chances are very good that you will never get back the value of the contributions that you put in. The situation is comparably grim for single females--and for two-earner couples. 
If we were to raise taxes to restore the system to solvency--or, for that matter, if we simply and mindlessly cut benefits--that situation would grow far worse. More and more Americans would be losing money through the program. Ultimately, its political support would be imperiled. The basic societal consensus in favor of Social Security--based on the premise that it treats everyone fairly--would be undermined. 
So we must find another way to restore Social Security to health--and to enable it to provide the kind of retirement income that Americans have a right to expect from the program. 
I believe that it is imperative that we begin to `pre-fund' the future liabilities of Social Security. A `pay as you go' system is not built for a demographic shift on the order of the baby boom generation. A `pay as you go' system assumes that there is always a demographic pyramid--that each generation coming through at the bottom is more numerous than the generation that they are supporting above them. 
But with the baby boomers coming through in such great numbers--and having comparatively fewer kids--the pyramid looks more like a rectangle. And the individuals at the bottom will bear a crushing burden unless we reduce some of it by putting additional funding aside now. 
Fortunately, we have an opportunity to do this. We have projections of near-term budget surpluses--and we already have short-term Social Security surpluses. We are collecting money that the government does not need to meet current operations, and we are collecting it through the Social Security system. 
The very first thing we should do is to give this extra money directly back to taxpayers, allow them to own it once again, and to fund a portion of their future retirement benefits through those personally-owned retirement accounts. 
Our legislation would do that. It would refund 2% of the current payroll tax back to individual Americans, to be used to directly finance some of their future Social Security benefits. We will move that portion of the benefit--and of future unfunded liabilities--off of the federal ledger. 
We would set up these personal accounts on the model of the Thrift Savings Plan currently provided to federal employees. We do this because it is an obvious way to reduce administrative costs. We also do it to avoid new mandates on employers. Employers would continue to pay the payroll tax just as they do now, and individuals would decide in which fund they want 2% of the current 12.4% payroll tax to be invested. 
The Thrift Savings Plan is a tested, workable way of generating investment wealth for beneficiaries. It strikes a reasonable balance between providing good investment opportunities and limiting individual risk. Perhaps most importantly, all Americans would have the opportunity to save for retirement on a payroll deduction basis--not just those who have pension plans, or who have gone through the trouble of setting up IRAs. This will do a tremendous amount to provide investment wealth to the millions of Americans who have not thus far had the opportunity to share in that wealth. 
Our legislation would also permit individuals to make $2,000 in extra voluntary contributions--above the 2% automatically redirected for them--to these personal savings accounts. This means that we have created a vehicle through which net national savings should increase. The more that individuals contribute to their personal accounts--the more retirement income they will have--and the greater the chances that they will be able to retire early, just as is the case with other retirement saving. 
This proposal is the most comprehensive one developed to date. It has been scored by the Social Security actuaries as achieving solvency through the next century. Perhaps even more importantly, it eliminates the enormous financing gap under current law. If we enact this legislation, we will remove the need for taxpayers to pony up hundreds of billions of dollars, above payroll taxes, in order to pay current benefits. Each year, the cash flow for the system will be smooth and manageable, and there will be a much closer balance between payroll tax revenue and the benefits that must be paid from it. 
Moreover, we have compared the results of our plan with a plan that would simply balance the current system within the existing 12.4% tax rate. In general, beneficiaries will receive much more income from our plan than they would from a plan that simply balanced the old system without personal accounts. 
We have also compared the benefits that our plan would provide to beneficiaries relative to current law, presuming that current benefits were made whole with tax increases. A 2.2% payroll tax hike to make the current system actuarially sound was compared with the income that individuals would receive if they made 2.2% voluntary contributions to our personal accounts. Virtually across the board, individuals would do much, much better under our plan. 
These are among the reasons why a personal account system is so vital for Social Security reform. Not only will they remove some of the unfunded liabilities of the federal government, but they will provide greater income to individual beneficiaries. 
We have also carefully thought through the relationship between personal account income and income through the traditional Social Security system. I would like to comment about some of what our legislation would accomplish in this regard. 
Personal accounts, by their nature, are not progressive. There is a direct relationship between money put in and benefits received. It is not redistributed from wealthy beneficiaries to needier ones. 
Accordingly, if we move towards a system that includes personal accounts, benefits on the traditional side must be made more progressive if we are ultimately to have a system that is just as progressive, as a whole, as is our current one. We have done this with our plan. 
Our plan includes a new `minimum benefit' poverty protection that would strengthen the safety net for low-income beneficiaries. If an individual works for a full 40 years, we would guarantee that they will not retire in poverty. An individual becomes eligible for some of the protection after 20 years of work, and receives increased protection for every quarter of work after that. 
Thus, for low-income beneficiaries, our plan would provide additional income security, even without the personal accounts. The personal account income would be a pure bonus for them. Even if they invest badly, their basic protections will be secure--not only secure, but strengthened. 
In the short term, because of these protections, the Social Security system would become more progressive than it is now. Ultimately, when the personal accounts have built up to be much larger, in the year 2050 or 2060, the progressivity of the system would be essentially what is now--the main difference being that individuals would have much more income. 
We also did much to correct the flawed incentives of the current system. We eliminate the earnings test above the normal retirement age--a disincentive for continued work. 
We would also increase the delayed retirement credit, and restore the proper relationship between normal retirement and early retirement benefits. Under current law, an individual has little incentive to wait until normal retirement age, because the extra payroll taxes he pays during those years will never fully be received back in benefits. We would change this, so that for each year an individual works, benefits would increase more sharply, and work would be rewarded. 
We also would credit an individual for every year of earnings in the benefit formula. Right now, the Social Security system only calculates a benefit based on the average of the highest 35 years of earnings. Many reform proposals would increase this number of years, effectively reducing benefits. Our proposal also recognizes the necessity of increasing the number of computation years in the denominator of this formula--but on the other hand, we would credit an individual in the numerator for every year of earnings, no matter how small. 
I am certain that my colleagues have received letters from senior citizens who say, `I am working part-time at the age of 64, but it is not among my highest years of lifetime earnings. I won't get any credit for this in my Social Security benefits. Why not?' We believe that we should reward all work, and this proposal would. We even would have the minimum benefit guarantee also depend on the total number of years worked. If we enact this proposal, rewards for continued work would be greatly strengthened, and our country will benefit as a result. 
At this point, I feel compelled to point out that there is no `free lunch' in Social Security reform. It is essential that we enact personal accounts, but we must enact them in the right way. 
Our proposal would explicitly replace unfunded benefits with funded benefits. We move part of the current payroll tax into personal accounts, to fund future benefits. This only makes policy sense if we use such a change to reduce federal liabilities. If we set up personal accounts--but leave all of the old, traditional liabilities in place--we have not achieved anything. Indeed, we could make the financing problem worse. 
So we gradually replace unfunded benefits with funded ones. Every responsible proposal to move towards pre-funded benefits will be vulnerable to the attack that it is `cutting' benefits, even though in sum, total benefits would be higher than under a `traditional fix.' It is imperative that Congress and the public not buy into such misrepresentations as we undertake Social Security reform. If we leave in place all of the unfunded liabilities, and all of the old unfunded benefit promises, then we will leave in place all of the projected tax increases as well. 
For example. Our proposal would, in order to prevent the traditional system from posing an ever-increasing burden on taxpayers, gradually raise the age of eligibility for full benefits to 70 in the year 2037 (for individuals turning 62 in the year 2029.) No one over the age of 31 would be affected by the full phase-in of this change. 
At the same time, it must be noted--we do not set an age for access to the personal retirement accounts. Our proposal would allow people to retire on these accounts once they are capable of providing a poverty-level annual benefit--even if this earlier than early retirement age. This is an incentive for individuals to put more money into these accounts, and it provides them with flexibility on their age of retirement that they do not have under current law. 
We would also require additional reforms to the Consumer Price Index, and adjust the bend points in the Social Security benefit formula in a progressive manner, to gradually phase down the liabilities on the traditional side as we move those benefits over into funded accounts. 
I would repeat: Personal accounts are an indispensable component of a Social Security reform program that delivers more retirement income than merely balancing an unreformed system can possibly provide. But they will not solve our long-term financing problems unless we use them to phase down the unfunded liabilities of the old system. This means directly addressing the growth of the unfunded benefits we are promising to pay out, at the same time that we are replacing them with funded benefits. 
As a result, we believe our plan is the most fiscally responsible proposal yet devised. The net liabilities upon the federal government in any year during the baby boom retirement period--whether you pick 2020, 2025, 2030, or beyond--would be significantly less than under almost any other proposal. We have avoided any and all tax increases--while at the same time avoided unseen financing costs above and beyond the explicit tax rates. 
We have also produced a proposal that will give beneficiaries the opportunity to generate more retirement income through self-directed investments, provide a Social Security system that the economy can sustain, and at the same time enhance protections against the risk of poverty. 
I want to thank my co-sponsors--especially Senator John Breaux, Congressman Kolbe, and Congressman Stenholm--and their staffs, who have worked so closely with me and with my staff throughout a long and difficult process. 
I also want to thank all others who are constructively participating in the Social Security reform debate. We have made it this far without turning this critical issue into a partisan shooting match. I am pleased that the President has remained open to various proposals for reform, and we have been reaching out to him to explain our ideas. I am also appreciative that Senators Moynihan and Kerrey have also produced an actuarially sound proposal, and that discussions of the differences between our proposals have been made on a constructive basis. I would extend a similar appreciation for a number of other Senators who are exploring this issue seriously--everyone from Congressmen Mark Sanford and Nick Smith, to Senators Roth, Santorum and Phil Gramm in our own chamber.

Mr. GREGG. I would just like to commend the Senator from Mississippi for his hard work and dedication on this bill, and would like to thank him for his particular attention to FDA matters. It is important that the regulatory programs be adequately funded, and of particular importance to me and a number of my colleagues is the important regulatory program for cosmetics in the Office of Cosmetics and Color within the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. As the Senator from Mississippi knows too well, the FDA recently announced cutbacks in this program, and I just wanted to thank him for the report language accompanying this bill and its encouragement for restoring this program to previous years levels. 
It is my understanding that our colleagues in the House have provided a $2.5 million increase to restore this program to that level, and I would hope that we can work to ensure that the final version of this bill contains that increase.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this bill and also to express my appreciation and respect for the leaders of this committee in developing this bill. I know Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, Senator Coats and Senator Dodd have spent an immense amount of time on this and have done an extraordinarily good job of pulling together a strong bill which will ensure we continue a major commitment--a very significant commitment--to those people in our Nation who are attending school and use Federal resources to assist them in attending school. 
We understand rather well that our Nation, especially in the New England region, depends, for our energy and our productivity, on basically people's creativity and their brain power. In New Hampshire, for example, we don't have any natural resources that produce great wealth, such as oil or large farmlands or mineral deposits. Our great natural resource in our State, and much of this country, is the wonderful minds of the people who work in our State and who produce products and, as a result of producing those products, which are competitive around the world, create prosperity, jobs and a good lifestyle. 
The key to that, of course, is quality education, and first-class education depends on having students who have the ability to pick and choose among colleges and are able to afford the college of their choice to attend. In order to accomplish that, they have to have support, in many instances. 
As the Senator from Connecticut so precisely outlined, the cost of quality education is going up dramatically, much faster than the price of most products in this country; in fact, almost 100 percent faster than the cost-of-living index over the last few years. 
What is driving that cost, we are not absolutely sure. There are many of us who have opinions on it, but we are not sure. One thing we know is because those costs are going up quickly, it is becoming harder and harder to pay for college education. This bill is an attempt to address that and make sure students have available to them the resources necessary for a first-class college education. 
As has been alluded to--this bill is filled with a lot of excellent ideas and many have already been outlined--but as has been alluded to, the core issue, the most important provision in this bill is the change in the student loan interest rates. Students who want to receive a higher education but must take out loans to do so will have a better chance in succeeding when they get out of school because the cost of paying back those loans will be less because the interest rates will have been cut, and that is a major step, a positive step in the right direction. 
In addition to cutting the rates, we also cut the amount the Federal Government pays to support the lenders who supply the loans. As you know, lenders currently make very little money on student loans--many people know this, anyway--and the high cost of administration, however, that is tied to 
student loans has been reduced in this bill and, as a result, we not only cut the rate that it costs students to borrow money to go to college but we also cut the actual amount that lenders are going to make. 
The big debate was whether or not we would cut it even further. The issue really wasn't whether or not these costs of administration should be cut further, the issue really came down to a question of whether or not we were going to shift from a system which had two competing arenas in which you could get a loan--a direct loan from the Federal Government or private loan from a private lender, to a single provider of loans--basically the Government. 
For those of us who have seen the Government function under the Direct Student Loan Program, we have seen a dramatic and considerable risk to the entire loan portfolio, the ability of students to get loans if they were only given the option of going to the Federal Government. We wanted to make sure that this adjustment in loan rate was done in a way that maintained the viable private market. 
In New Hampshire, for example, 96 percent--96 percent--of all the students go through a private loan process rather than through the direct loan process. So you can see that if a direct loan is their only avenue, it will actually create chaos. We know that to be a fact. Just last year when the Direct Loan Program was gearing up and was supposed to be ready and able to take care of the amount of activity that was being applied under the Direct Loan Program, we in the Congress had to pass an emergency bill to basically bail out the Direct Loan Program of the Federal Government which was already in chaos even though it hadn't even gotten up to, I think, much more than 25, 30 percent at that point in student loans, which is approximately where it is right now. 
We know for a fact that the Direct Loan Program has some serious, serious problems. Not only that, but we are seeing that some of these problems, independent of the fact that they simply can't handle the volume of loans that will occur were the private sector driven out of the market, part of these problems are tied to their administrative activity. 
The cost of the administration in the Direct Loan Program has gone up dramatically. By `administration,' I am talking about compensation, travel and operational costs. It has gone up almost 143 percent, I believe is the number, even though the number of loans have only gone up by something around 35 percent during this same period. 
The increase in the administrative overhead is a classic example of what happens, of course, when you have a Federal agency involved, when there is very little accountability in the area of administrative overhead and you have a huge bureaucracy which is dominated not by a desire to be efficient, but by a desire basically to create work, in many instances, and to be an agency which covers itself on every issue and creates bureaucrats for purposes of watching bureaucrats. 
The whole issue in this bill, or the core issue in this bill was how we were going to balance private loan programs with the Direct Loan Program. We did finally reach an understanding on that, and it is a reasonable understanding. It is going to cost us money, but, in the end, it will allow us to give to students the most important item, which is a lower interest rate, and at the same time maintain a competitive marketplace where there will be pressure on the Federal Government's program, the direct lending program, to be more efficient because it will be competing with the private sector programs which have to be efficient in order to survive. That is a very big plus that that decision was made in this way. 
There are a couple of other issues that were put into this bill I was actively involved in, and I want to address also 
one the Senator from Minnesota brought to our attention. That was the violence on campuses, especially directed at women. He had an amendment in committee that addressed this and created a program authorizing, under the Violence Against Women Act, $10 million to be set aside for the purposes of looking at the problem we now have on colleges. 
Unfortunately, it is a serious problem. It has been seen here in the Capital region and the University of Maryland. I doubt there is a major college in this country that has not experienced a series of violent acts relative to women on campuses. 
So not only did the Senator from Minnesota bring the idea forward, but it seemed to me to be such a good idea in the appropriations bill which I fund, we are going to be funding the idea. This may be the fastest funded authorization that has happened around here in a long time. But there will be $10 million spent relative to violence against women on campuses. 
Another issue which is in this bill that I think deserves some mention is the fact that it addresses the issue of the use of drugs by students. The Senator from Connecticut was accurate. He said, in polling parents, the concern of the cost of education was listed as their No. 2 concern relative to how they are going to handle their children when they are growing up. He also mentioned that the No. 1 concern is if their children will become involved with drugs, and illegal drugs specifically. 
This bill reflects that concern. It says that taxpayers should not be carrying the burden of supporting a student who has taken the irresponsible activity of using and being found to be guilty of using an illegal drug. Basically, it says that if you are caught using an illegal drug, and you are convicted of using an illegal drug, then you lose your eligibility for a student loan--on a first offense for 1 year; on a second offense for 2 years; and on a third offense indefinitely. 
You can avoid this if you, as a student, go through a properly approved, satisfactory drug rehabilitation program. And the Secretary has the capacity to set up the regulations as to what will be a satisfactory drug rehabilitation program. So you can mute the effect of this, but essentially it sends a very clear message to students that if they are going to obtain the benefit--having the taxpayers of this country support them when they are in college through giving them basically a subsidized loan--then they are going to have to be responsible in the manner in which they pursue their academic careers and not use illegal drugs. This is, I think, a major step forward in delivering the correct philosophical position on the question of using drugs. 
So this, on balance, is a good bill. It moves in the right direction. It confirms and energizes and reinforces programs which have proven to be extraordinarily successful. Again, I congratulate the leadership of the committee for bringing it forward. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator in allowing me to proceed. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the Senator from Florida and to talk a little bit about the payment process on this amendment--how we pay for this idea, which is an excellent idea, to make sure that the people benefiting from the GI bill don't end up being penalized for having participated in our military. Ironically, as has been mentioned, we treat people who participate in the AmeriCorps better than we treat the people who participate in the military. 
The Senator from Florida corrects this problem. In order to pay for this, he suggested that we reduce the overhead administrative costs within the 458 account of the direct lending program, and there is great justification for doing this--great justification for doing this. 
One of the concerns I think many of us had when the Federal Government got into the business of lending money for education was that we would end up with a bureaucracy that would end up spending a lot of money and maybe not be as efficient as the private marketplaces are. That is just inherent in government; government at all levels does not have a profit motive, and therefore efficiency is always questionable, and in many instances efficiency is poor. There are few exceptions to that, but for the most part you can say almost as a Black rule of law that a government program is going to be less efficient than a private program that is subject to competition. 
In the instances of direct lending, we are seeing that that appears to have been borne out again. We know that the workload, casework load, is up from 1992 by about 29 percent. But we see that the administrative overhead is up by 143 percent, which is an increase of 120 points more, or 115 points more than the workload going up. And we are not talking here about things which are directly student related; we are talking more about things which are tied to inefficiency, in my opinion. 
We see that, for example, in the data processing area, the cost has gone up about 222 percent; in the payroll roll area, the cost has gone up 351 percent; in the training area, the cost has gone up 480 percent; in the staffing area, the cost has gone up 429 percent--this in comparison, again, to a workload which has only gone up 29 percent. 
So clearly there is a great deal of expansion in overhead costs here which is questionable on its face and on a statistical evaluation. So the Senator from Florida has included within his amendment an attempt to address this by reducing in the outyears the amount of increase which will be allowed in the area of administrative costs. 
I congratulate him for that because I do think that is the right approach, and I think it is the way that this amendment should be paid for. I believe it is going to end up benefiting not only the GIs and the members of the service who benefit from the underlying amendment, but I think it is going to benefit the taxpayers generally, because we will be saving money out of administrative costs which are very questionable and applying it to getting people educated, which is the key. 
So I congratulate the Senator from Florida for his amendment.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to join with what I am sure will be numerous Senators in congratulating the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from New York and the Committee on Finance for bringing forward this exceptionally good bill which is truly timely. 
Many of us, as we have tried to help folks out in our States, have run into situations where people have been treated in ways which can only be described as abusive by the Internal Revenue Service, where the Internal Revenue Service has gone way beyond the appropriate action for the purposes of collecting the revenues of the country and has treated American citizens in a way that you might expect were they to be living in a police state instead of in a democracy. 
In my experience, probably one of the worst cases I have ever seen of Government excesses involves a family known as Barron in New Hampshire. That family, unfortunately, got into some tax trouble, failed to pay its taxes, and the IRS, in an appropriate way, attempted to collect those taxes--at least appropriately at the beginning. But then it got carried away. And as a result of getting carried away, it put that family through an extraordinary trauma, to a point where Mr. Barron ended up committing suicide. And his wife, Shirley Barron, who is now responsible for the family, found herself in a situation which was beyond all reason, which was untenable and which was horrible. 
A lien had been put on her house. Her children's bank accounts had been taken. Her bank accounts had been taken. The IRS was even making it impossible for her to pay her electric fee, her utility fees. This all occurred after a time period when they thought they had reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service. They thought an understanding had been reached, and, in fact, an understanding had been reached. Then the IRS, in a manner which can only be called bait and switch, backed out of that agreement and assessed them with even more penalties and interest. And on an original tax bill which was, I believe, somewhere in the vicinity of $20,000 or $40,000, they ended up with an obligation, according to the Internal Revenue Service, of multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
It was a situation which was so horrendously handled that it literally drove Mr. Barron to commit suicide, destroyed the lives of this family. And it has become a cause celebre in New Hampshire, and to some degree nationally. It would be terrible in and of itself, because there is really nothing we can do as a Government to correct what happened to Mrs. Barron and the treatment she received. Her life has been irreparably harmed, and her family will always suffer as a result of this. 
It would be terrible enough if it were the only instance of this type of situation occurring, but as we saw from the hearings which the Senate Finance Committee held under Chairman Roth, it was not the only instance. Regrettably, on too many occasions the Internal Revenue Service has acted in this almost malicious but certainly abusive way. 
This does not mean that the Internal Revenue Service is populated with people who wish to treat American citizens, taxpayers, in a manner that is totally inappropriate. No. In fact, just the opposite. The Internal Revenue Service is filled with good and conscientious people, in my opinion; but there are bad apples. 
More importantly than that, the Service has created an atmosphere, a way of management, a culture, which has allowed the excesses to proceed in the actions against taxpayers which are beyond the pale of reasonableness to become commonplace, through the lack of management and, in my opinion, due to lack of structure, both legal and managerial. So this bill attempts to correct that. 
The most important thing it does, or one of the most important things it does, is it shifts the burden of proof, gets us back to where we should have been to begin with, which is to presume that the taxpayer is innocent rather than presuming that the taxpayer is guilty until the taxpayer has proven himself or herself innocent. That is very important, so that the taxpayer goes in at least on some level of a playing field which has some levelness to it versus a playing field which was radically tilted against the taxpayer under the present structure. 
In addition, the bill protects the innocent spouse. In so many instances, the spouse is a part of the familial activity as being part of a family; signs the return without a great deal of knowledge of what is in that return, sometimes without any great knowledge of what is in that return, but signs it and then finds out later on, as was the case in Mrs. Barron's situation, that action has been taken that was inappropriate and liability exists. And when the spouse who is responsible disappears, as a result of divorce, or in this case as a result of death, the innocent spouse ends up with an obligation which is totally inappropriate. So the protection of the innocent spouse is absolutely critical and a very, very good part of this bill. 
In addition, the bill takes what I think is a critical step in the area of managing the Internal Revenue Service's procedures because it limits the ability of the Internal Revenue Service to assess interest and penalties in a manner which uses the interest and penalties to basically force settlements on the taxpayer, even when the taxpayer feels they did not owe the obligation. 
There is no question but that the basic collection process at the Internal Revenue Service proceeds with, in many instances, running up the interest and penalty obligations so when they get into negotiations with the taxpayer, even if the taxpayer knows they do not owe the taxes, the utility of proceeding becomes so expensive, it becomes so impossible to ever want to proceed in a manner which would put you at risk for the interest and penalties which have been run up that you end up paying the underlying tax and negotiating out the interest and penalties. That is a collection process which, regrettably, has become the modus operandi of the Internal Revenue Service. 
This bill puts some limitation on that by limiting the ability of the Internal Revenue Service to run those interest and penalties up if they have not notified the taxpayer within a timely manner--18 months initially, 12 months as time goes out--that an obligation is due or they perceive that an obligation is due. This is an extremely important change in the collection process. In addition, the bill provides much better services to the taxpayer, which is critical. 
Thus, I am extremely supportive of this effort. I say this. It does not resolve the problem. The problem goes to the basic law. The fact is that we have created a tax law which is so complex, so convoluted, such a mishmash of regulations and cross-purpose legislation, that it becomes basically unenforceable because it is not comprehendible. 
After finishing law school, I went back to school for 3 years and got a graduate degree in tax policy with an LL.M. I have to say, I do not fill out my own tax return because it is simply too complex. Now, if I cannot do it, how can somebody who is just working every day and trying to make ends meet be able to do it? Obviously, they cannot. 
And what we see in the collection atmosphere is that the Internal Revenue agents, regrettably, because of the complexity in many instances, do not understand it because it is not understandable. 
So the law itself is a basic problem here, and we simply have to reform the law if we really want to correct this problem. We have to go to a much simpler law, a fairer law, something that can be managed in a way that is comprehendible to people who are working every day and trying to fill out their return, who don't happen to be specialists. 
As an interim step, as an effort to try to correct what is basically a law that is not enforceable effectively but is being enforced in a manner which in many cases is abusive--as an interim step, this bill makes great progress. Thus, I congratulate the committee for their efforts. I hope it will not be looked at as the end of the process but will be looked at as a step in the process to reforming our tax laws so that they can be administered in a way which will regain the confidence of the American people that they are fair and that they are reasonable. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, a lot of folks have spoken today, and I reserved commenting on each speech until this time. I recognize that we want to get on with a vote--I don't want to delay that process--but I believe a few points need to be made to clarify the ground, to blow the smoke away, if I may use that metaphor, from the issue. 
Let's begin with the question of immunity and whether or not immunity is granted in this bill. 
Immunity for the purposes of this debate has become a term of art. Like so many terms that we use here in the Senate, it may not be the most precise term but it is the term that accurately from the political standpoint defines the event here. 
The fact is that under this bill the tobacco industry is going to be given a special preferential position in the order of American commerce, a position which no other industry will have, a position which is totally outside of the traditional manner in which we have managed our marketplace under our capitalist system. 
The limitations in this bill on the ability of individuals who have been harmed by the tobacco companies are considerable. They are significant and they will impact people. Pure logic tells you this, because, obviously, if the argument is being made that the only way you can get the tobacco company to come back to the table is if you give them these protections, there must be something pretty darned substantive to these protections. 
So very obviously the limitations which are being placed on the capacity of the American consumer to recover for the damage that has been caused to him or her by the tobacco companies are significant, if this bill passes. Let me list a few of them. 
There will be limitations on the amount of recovery on punitive damages because there is a cap. There will be limitations on the amount of damages recovered from compensation damages because there is a cap. There will be a preemption of actions by States, municipalities, and counties for future 
claims. There will be immunity for wholesalers, retailers, insurers, and the ingredient suppliers for past and future claims. There will be, most importantly, a structure set up where the tobacco companies will pick who is going to be the winner and who is going to be the loser on the issue of lawsuits brought against them. 
What an ironic situation, as I have said before on this floor. 
The way this cap works, it is the first person to the courthouse to get a settlement who gets the money. And the tobacco companies, since they are the ones being sued, can pick who is going to win. If they are sued by three different groups--a group of schoolteachers from New Hampshire, a group of kids from Pennsylvania, a group of friends from Ohio, and another group of friends from Illinois--they can settle with the friend from Ohio, and the friends from Illinois. If the cap is used up, the schoolteachers and the kids are out of it. They are out of it for that year, and they well may be out of it forever depending on how much the cap is used up, and in the next year, also. 
So the people who are injured who have brought the lawsuit find themselves in the impossible position, or the ironic position, at a minimum, of having to go to the tobacco companies on bent knees and say, `Please settle with me first so I can get into the fund before somebody else,' which means that you inevitably create not an adversarial relationship but a supplicant relationship between those who are suing and those who are being sued, which is not in the tradition of the American jurisprudence system, to say the least. 
Equally important, the concept that an industry will have protection from lawsuits in the marketplace is antithetic to the American concept of a free market. The protection that consumers have today, no matter what product they buy, is they can go into the courtroom, if they are harmed by that product, and get redress. There are a lot of other ways they can get redress, too. But the primary redress is that they can go into that courtroom or one of the primary redresses, if they have been physically damaged, or if somebody in their family has been killed, and they can get a recovery, if they can make their case. That is called the free market system. It is called the capitalist system. Under this proposal, that doesn't work.

Mr. GREGG. So the marketplace is being fundamentally changed for one industry alone, the tobacco industry. That, in my opinion, is obviously a mistake. 
Why is this being done? Representation as to why it is being done was made by a number of Senators, and I think they 
are accurate to their theories as to why it is being done. It is being done, to quote the Senator from Rhode Island, because they hope to bring the tobacco companies back to the table by putting in this significant benefit, which is protection from liability, immunity, or a form of immunity at a minimum. 
It was interesting that the Senator from Utah, who is very familiar with this issue, said that even the caps, as it is presently structured, aren't strong enough to bring--they aren't enough protection to the tobacco industries to bring them back to the table, that they don't do enough, that they don't go far enough. That is an interesting comment, because what we do know is that the tobacco companies are not at the table right now. In fact, we know from the statement of the chairman of one of the tobacco companies that they have walked away from the table, and to quote him, `There is no process which is even remotely likely to lead to an acceptable comprehensive solution this year.' 
So they are not planning to come back to the table. Yet, here we have this deal which has been made, as I mentioned earlier, a deal with the devil, the producers of this product, which kills people and addicts people, and the devil walked away from the table. And now we have the unseemly situation of the U.S. Congress chasing after the devil saying, `Please take my plan. Please take it. Take it, please. Please, please take this protection that we are offering.' It really is unseemly. It is inappropriate. More importantly, it doesn't make any sense. 
Why, if they are no longer participants in this process, would we want to give them a protection which no other industry in this country has today--it makes no sense--on the wish and the prayer that they are going to come back to the table someday in the future? I don't think so. I think it makes absolutely no sense that we should be making such a fundamental change in the way we manage our market, such a fundamental way in the way we manage our jurisprudence system, on a wish and a hope and a prayer that an industry, which has shown itself to be so endemically irresponsible, will for some reason suddenly become responsible and return to the table. I find that to be a concept which holds very little validity. 
But the most substantive reason to support the amendment which has been offered by myself and the Senator from Vermont and to change the language in this bill--remember the language which we are offering here was the original language of the healthy kid amendment, which was supported by the President. I must say somebody should ask the President why he has changed his position on this because he did support this language initially. He formally and bluntly supported it. 
But the primary concern here for supporting this language is this. We have an industry which produced a product that they knew killed people, and the evidence is conclusive on that. We have an industry which produced a product that they knew was addictive. Not only did they know it was addictive, but they increased the contents of that addictive part of the process, the nicotine, in order to increase the addictiveness of the product. They produced a product that was addictive, and they knew it was addictive. And then they took this product which killed people, which they knew killed people, which was addictive and which they knew was addictive, and they targeted the sales of it on our kids. 
This is not an industry which deserves special protection from the U.S. Congress. Call it immunity, call it limited liability, use whatever term of art you want to use, but the fact is, this is an extraordinary step of special protection for an industry which has produced a product which is fundamentally bad, which they knew was bad, and which they targeted on kids. 
While this Congress refuses to give that type of protection to other industries which are producing products which save lives--we do not give protection to medical devices which save lives; we do not give protections to automobile manufacturers that improve the style of life; we do not give protections to the computer manufacturer that improves the style of life; we don't give protections to the drug manufacturers that improve the style of life--we are going to give protection to the cigarette manufacturer, the tobacco producer that produced a product that kills you, that is addictive, and that was targeted on kids. 
The choice I think here is pretty clear. We can stick with a system that has worked for 200 years, called the marketplace, where the consumer has the right to go into the court system and defend themselves and get a reasonable recovery, or we can structure a brand new system to protect an industry which has proven itself beyond any test to be a dishonorable industry, which has tried to destroy the lives of many Americans in order to sell its product. 
From my standpoint, the choice should be simple. I hope the Members of the Senate will join with me and a fair number of other folks and Senator Leahy, who has been a strong advocate--and I very much appreciate his participation as a cosponsor of this amendment--in passing our amendment to eliminate this liability limitation by defeating the motion to table which is going to be made by the Senator from Arizona. 
I would like to say at this point before we go to the motion, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his courtesy and the Senator from Massachusetts for his courtesy in moving this amendment to a vote. I appreciate their courtesy. They have been more than fair in allowing us the opportunity to bring this forward and do it in a timely manner. I thank them for that. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment has received a fair amount of attention and I believe is fairly well understood by most of the membership, but it is important that we have a substantive discussion of it and an open debate of it over the next couple of hours. As I understand, Senator McCain has allotted that type of a time window. I very much appreciate that. 
I want to thank Senator McCain for his courtesy in allowing us to put this amendment in order at this time, and certainly I appreciate the manner in which he has managed this bill in such a fair way. 
The immunity issue is really at the essence of this bill and the public policy which this bill addresses. What we have here is an industry which produced a product which it knew killed people. It is an industry that produced a product which it knew addicted people. In fact, it created additives to that product so it would addict people at a higher rate than were the product sold in its natural state. Then, knowing that it had a product that killed people, and knowing that it had a product that addicted people, it then targeted the sales of that product on our kids. 
That is an industry which deserves very little in the way of courtesy or support or protection--and that is what this amendment is about, `or protection'--from the U.S. Congress. Yet, within this bill there is proposed language which would give a historic, unprecedented protection to the tobacco industry from liability on their lawsuits. 
Now, we have addressed this issue before in this body. In fact, not too long ago there was a sense of the Senate which said there shall be no immunity for the tobacco industry. That sense of the Senate passed the Senate by a 79 to 19 vote. This amendment is the real thing. It is calling to account that sense of the Senate. 
Now, the question here goes to the manner in which we, as a country, sell products. We are inherently the most capitalist, market-oriented economy in the world. As a result, we have been the most prosperous society in the world economically. What this amendment is about is maintaining a capitalist marketplace approach to the issue of the sale of a product in our society. 
What this bill does in its present form is institute an antimarket, anticapitalist approach into the process of producing and selling a product in this society. It gives an artificial, inappropriate, legislative protection to an industry from what has been the traditional way in which consumers have a right of redress against that industry. 
Remember, in our society when a consumer, when John and Mary Jones from Epping, NH, are sold a product that doesn't work, they have a variety of different avenues to address the failure of that product. Should that product harm them, one of their most appropriate avenues is to go to court to bring an action against the producer of that product and to get a recovery. That has been basically one of the essential elements for disciplining the marketplace in our capitalist society. We have not, as has been pursued in other nations, especially those that use a Socialist form of management of their marketplace, we have not had the Federal Government or any government come in and tell a consumer what they can and cannot buy, except in very limited instances. And we have certainly not limited that consumer's ability to recover should they be sold a product that doesn't work or that harms them. 
The right of redress in the court system, the right of redress for a consumer, is at the essence of having a competitive marketplace and a disciplined marketplace. When you eliminate that right of redress, which this bill does, when you take away the ability of the consumer, of the person who has been damaged, of John and Mary Jones of Epping, NH, to get a recovery for an injury they have received, you have artificially preserved the marketplace. But more importantly, you have given a unique, historic, and totally inappropriate protection to an industry. 
Now, let's think about this for a minute. Why would the Federal Government at any point in its history want to step in and bar the ability of the consumer to use the judicial method of protecting themselves in the marketplace? There might be instances where that would happen--national defenses might be an example. Under our law, once we did that in the area of people working at nuclear weapons factories. There was a national defense issue. 
Or it might occur if a product was deemed so beneficial that it was important to protect it. In those instances, of course, we have a situation where the Government raises the visibility of the need to protect the society as a whole over the individual. That has never happened. We have never found a product that was so beneficial. Or if we have, it has only occurred in the rarest of instances, so beneficial that we give that sort of protection. So that is a very unusual protection, to say the least. 
But what we have here is the granting of a significant, unusual protection of immunity to an industry that produces tobacco, which, as I mentioned in my opening statement, is a product that kills people, that addicts kids, and addicts people and is targeted at kids. It is very strange that we should pick that industry for which to give this sort of protection. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

<TEXT>
Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the amendment is a second-degree amendment, which simply perfects the amendment I offered, the underlying amendment. I will give a copy of the changes to the other side. I don't think they will find that they change the basic thrust of the original amendment. 
As I was discussing, the amendment goes to the question of immunity and why we would choose, for the first time in the history of this country, to grant immunity to an industry from lawsuits, which basically changes the whole concept of the marketplace system in our country--why we would choose the tobacco industry to which to give that immunity. It is just beyond comprehension that an industry that produces a product that kills people, which they designed to addict kids, would be chosen as the industry to which we are going to give immunity protection. It makes absolutely no sense. It skews the marketplace. I simply point out to those who might be of a conservative philosophy and may be following this argument that to have done this is an absolute affront to the concept of capitalism and a free market society. 
Now, there is an attempt in the bill to address the liability that tobacco companies generate as a result of their action--an $8 billion cap. Some will tell us that is a lot of money and that should satisfy everyone as a manner in which to redress the concerns of the consumer, of the individuals, of the kids, of the parents, the mom and pops, who have been damaged by the tobacco companies. And $8 billion is a huge amount of money on an annual cap for recovery on the loss. But it obviously isn't what the market sees as the potential liability here. Otherwise, there would not be a cap in the first place. So by its very definition it is an affront to the concept of a market-type approach to the selling of products in this country. 
Equally important is the way this cap works. It gives a disproportionate amount of power to the tobacco companies to decide who the winners and losers are, because it is essentially a race to the courthouse. The tobacco companies, under the proposal in this bill, would control who gets to the courthouse first. If they decided the XYZ lawsuit was more amenable to them to settle than the ABC lawsuit, or Mary Smith's lawsuit was less desirable to them, for some reason, than Hank Jones', they can settle the ABC lawsuit, the XYZ lawsuit, and the Mary Smith lawsuit, but they cannot settle the Hank Jones lawsuit, they can make him litigate. And, by the time he is finished, they have settled these other ones and, poof, the $8 billion is gone. So not only does it have the total irony of perverting the marketplace, it has the irony of giving the tobacco industry the capacity to choose who the winners and losers are in the process of determining people who are suing them for being caused physical damage. 
Can you think of anything more ironic? You have been damaged, your health has been destroyed, or maybe someone in your family has died as a result of the tobacco industry's actions, or some child was addicted and that child dies and the tobacco company gets to choose whether or not that person is going to be a winner under the lawsuit process. How unbelievably ironic and absurd that is. But that is the way this cap works. This is just one of the many, many technical problems with the concept of a cap, because what I think it reflects is the idea that when you put an artificial cap into a huge, dynamic economy like the United States', you are basically creating all sorts of unintended consequences that don't flow 
naturally in a capitalist system. Much more appropriate is that you allow the capitalist system to proceed in its usual and orderly course. 
Now, others will say, well, if you don't have immunity, then you inevitably drive these companies into bankruptcy. To begin with, we don't have any idea that that is true. What we know is that these industries are extraordinarily profitable. We know that, right now, they are pursuing major buy-backs. Philip Morris, an $8 million buy-back; RJR, a buy-back of its stock. When you start buying back your stock as a corporate leader, you are saying your stock is undervalued. If your stock is undervalued, it is the ultimate test that in the future you have a better chance of progressive sales and a strong market force for your industry. 
So the concept that if they don't have immunity, they are going to end up going bankrupt, I think the marketplace has discounted and rejected that and said that is not going to happen. In fact, there is a tremendous earning capacity out there, and we already know there is a tremendous capacity to pass on to the consumer, because that is the theme of this bill--to pass on to the consumer a significant part of the cost. As long as they can pass through that cost, it doesn't impact them at all, doesn't impact their capacity at all. 
So from a substantive standpoint, bankruptcy doesn't make any sense as a defensive argument to this. But just from a purely logical standpoint, it even makes less sense. Think about it this way. We are saying that to save the industry from bankruptcy we have to put on this cap. But at the same time, we have to tax it. The reason we are taxing it is to discourage people from consuming the product. And the logical extension of that is that if you are successful in taxing people and managing to discourage them from using the product, you are going to reduce utilization, which one presumes would inevitably lead to the collapse of the industry and potentially bankruptcy. 
So the bill, by its very nature, is inherently saying that the options of bankruptcy are there, but they are going to do it on a different system--through the tax system. Yet, they won't allow the marketplace to make that decision. They won't allow the marketplace to decide whether or not this industry survives, which is the way, traditionally, we have done it in this country. We don't traditionally say to an industry, well, you are about to go bankrupt, which is something that this industry can't say, certainly in light of what it is doing with stock values--so we, the Federal Government, are going to step in and give you unique protection; we are going to give you liability protection. And we certainly don't say it to an industry that has produced a product that kills people and has addicted them. 
For those people who don't believe this industry knew their product was addictive, I will cite a few quotes. We have here quotes from the Brown & Williamson documents, disclosed as a result of the Minnesota case, and from documents of RJR. Brown & Williamson in 1978--that is a long time ago; this wasn't just yesterday: 
Very few consumers are aware of the effects of nicotine, i.e., its addictive nature, and that nicotine is a poison. 
These folks knew a long time ago that they were selling an addictive product that killed people. This is a quote from RJR: 
Tobacco companies are basically in the nicotine business. . .Effective control of nicotine in our products should equate to a significant product performance and cost advantages. 
That is a pretty cynical statement. It reflects the fact that the tobacco industry knew they were selling an addictive product. 
Nicotine is the addicting agent in cigarettes. 
The evidence is beyond question. They knew that it was a poison, that it killed people, and they knew it was addictive. 
Second, there are some who may say, `Well, they don't really target kids.' That is very hard to defend also because the facts speak for themselves from their own documentation. They look on kids as their source of future revenues. 
This is from the RJR documents of 1974: 
Let's look at the growing importance of the young adult in the cigarette market. In 1960, this young adult market, the 14-24 group, represented 21 percent of the population . . . they will represent 27 percent of the population in 1975. They are tomorrow's cigarette business. 
How cynical could you be? Let's first produce a product that kills you, let's make it addictive, and then let's target it at kids.

Mr. GREGG. I would like to complete my statement, and then I will yield. 
In 1974, `Marlboro dominates in the 17 and younger age category, capturing over 50 percent of the market.' 
Obviously, Philip Morris knew that Marlboro was making money in that area. 
I will not read the next statement, but it has the same context. Kids were the target. 
So we have here, as I mentioned earlier, the concept that we are going to be giving immunity, for the first time in our history, to an industry. What industry do we pick? Do we pick the people who are making heart valves so you can live longer? Do we pick an industry that makes hip joints to make you live longer? Do we pick the industry that is making a drug that will maybe make your life easier? Do we pick an industry that makes cars so you can get places faster? No. We pick an industry which targets kids with a poisonous product that they made addictive. And they knew it all along. 
The last argument that we hear is, 
We can't do this bill unless we have the tobacco companies cooperate, and we can't have cooperation unless we have some sort of immunity for the tobacco companies, unless we give them this historic new authority and protection. 
First off, that is not true. The vast majority of the advertising controls that we think are needed can be done without the tobacco companies' participation. Yes, there are some issues of the first amendment that we can't step over. But for the most part, we can do a great deal to limit their access, especially to kids. 
Second, we can compete with them. We can produce our own advertising programs, which compete much more aggressively than they can in the marketplace. Of course, that is the traditional American way: Make the point, make it effectively, that tobacco kills. 
But, most importantly, I think it ought to be pointed out here that we are making a deal with the Devil and the Devil walked away from the table. There is no tobacco company participation in this process any longer. Here we are offering them the most significant legal protection probably in the history of the country in exchange for them being willing to give us some limited ability to limit their advertising activities, and they are not even at the table to accept the offer. In fact, they have walked away from the table. They 
said they don't want to have anything more to do with this process. 
The quote from the head of RJR is: 
The extraordinary settlement, reached on June 20th last year, that could have set the Nation on a dramatically new and constructive direction regarding tobacco, is dead. And there is no process which is even more remotely likely to lead to an acceptable comprehensive solution this year. 
With that statement, he walked out. He said, I am not going to participate in this and tobacco is not participating in this anymore. 
So you have this almost pathetic situation where the U.S. Congress is passing immunity and giving this outrageous new authority to the tobacco companies to protect them from lawsuits. The tobacco companies have walked away, and the U.S. Congress is sort of chasing after them on bended knee, saying, `Please, tobacco companies, please, tobacco companies, please take our offer.' 
My goodness. First, we make a deal with the Devil, and then we chase after him asking for him to take our deal. I mean it is just ridiculous, it is inappropriate, it is not becoming of the Congress, and it is wrong. 
The language which Senator Leahy and I have proposed here is essentially the same language which was in the original HEALTHY Kids bill, which was endorsed by the White House. I regret that we have not received White House support for reinserting this language. I regret that the leadership within this Congress has not supported the insertion, although on the House side I note, I believe that the Speaker supports no immunity language, although I don't want to speak for him. I have read reports to that effect. 
But the point is that this is not dramatic language, it is not outrageous language, it is the language that was in the original HEALTHY Kids bill, and it essentially says no immunity. It says what this Senate said back when we passed the sense of the Senate 79 to 19: No immunity for the tobacco industry, because they don't deserve it, it is wrong, and it is inconsistent with the capitalist system.

Mr. GREGG. No, I would not. I happen to think the use of the word `immunity' is correct. The fact is that we are setting up a new structure here where, for the first time, we are giving product liability protection to an industry which clearly doesn't deserve it. The term `immunity' has become a term of art relative to that discussion. From my standpoint, the term of `immunity' properly defines that. If the Senator from Massachusetts wishes to define it in a more narrow sense and 
say, `We are giving them product liability protection but we are not giving them immunity,' that is the Senator from Massachusetts's definitional approach, and that is fine. But the point is the same. We are creating a unique, unusual, significant action which changes the jurisprudence that has dominated the marketplace in this country for 200 years.

Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, since I have the floor, I understand there is some comity here on amendments back and forth. But what I would like is to get an understanding, as we move through this process, that those of us who have amendments which have some impact on this bill and which need some time to be debated are going to get a commitment for time and a place when they will be brought up. 
I can offer my amendment at this time. It is not my inclination to do that, if I can get an understanding without losing the floor that I am going to get a time to bring up my amendment. 
I ask the leader of the bill if he would be willing to agree--and opposing side--if they would be willing to agree that the amendment on immunities, which I think everybody is familiar with and is sponsored by myself and Senator Leahy, would be available to be brought up at a time specific on Thursday so that there will be a reasonable lead time here, and that time would be at 10 o'clock, assuming that is agreeable to everybody and we have 3 hours on that amendment and no second-degrees be in order and we proceed to vote on it. 
Without that sort of an assurance, I am going to offer my amendment at this time.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, possibly later today we will begin on this floor the debate and voting on the language relating to the tobacco settlement. This is obviously a fairly significant piece of legislation. It has the potential to represent one of the most complex pieces of legislation ever considered by this body--at least certainly in my time in Government. It also represents, potentially, one of the largest tax increases that this Congress will consider assessing. It represents a dramatic step in a number of different areas of law in which this Congress has toyed with but has never really fully participated. 
I want to talk about one specific area of that issue, which is the area of granting to a manufacturer of a product in this country product liability protection, or immunity, as the term has become known. There are a lot of products made in this Nation today, a lot of products made for the purpose of improving the lives of people, a lot of products made for enjoyment, products that are made to get us through a day, and products like tobacco. Most of these products--in fact, the vast majority of these products--have no special protection should they be produced in a manner that harms someone. And if an individual in our country is harmed by the use of a product, they have recourse through our court system. It is a very integral part of the free marketplace that an individual who buys a product have the ability to go into court and address the safety of that product as it affected that individual. 
Why is that critical? Because a long time ago we rejected the concept of caveat emptor in this country--that if you sell somebody a product, the person who buys the product assumes all the risk. In order to discipline the marketplace, in order to make sure we had a safe marketplace where things being sold in our country in the capitalist system would have some discipline in the quality of those items, we have developed a large amount of case law that allows an individual who thinks they have been impacted or can prove they have been impacted by, or harmed by, a product sold to them has a right to go into court and proceed to get recovery for that harm, if they can prove it. 
It is one of the really core elements that makes our marketplace work. It is one of the core elements that makes our Nation function as a dynamic economic engine. When we start addressing that issue of what rights an individual has in relationship to purchasing a product, we have to be very sensitive to the importance of maintaining the capacity of an individual to get redress in the court system. I say that in reference to the tobacco bill coming at us in an action that I think is absolutely inexplicable from the standpoint of maintaining a disciplined marketplace and from the standpoint of protecting individuals, which grants to the tobacco companies of this country--and internationally for that matter--protection from lawsuits where they have harmed individuals. 
Why is this so outrageous, such an act of incomprehensibility from my standpoint? Because the product we are talking about here--tobacco--has three characteristics. 
First, we know that it kills people, and the tobacco companies that produced it knew and know that it kills people. 
Second, we know that it is an addictive product, and the tobacco companies that produced it knew it was addictive and, in fact, structured the product in such a way by putting a certain amount of nicotine into it, that they produced an even more addictive product than had they simply gone forward with pure tobacco. 
Third, the tobacco companies intentionally, purposefully, with the idea that they would create a larger marketplace, targeted the sale of their product on children. 
So we have a product that kills people, and the manufacturer of that product knew it; we have a product that was addictive, and the manufacturer of that product created it so that it would be addictive and knew it was; and we have a product where the companies that produced that product targeted children to try to produce a larger marketplace and a lifetime user once they get that child addicted--knowing that it would kill the children as they grew older. Knowing that. 
And we have picked this product, with those three incredible characteristics that are applied to the tobacco industry, to be the first product to receive major protection--or we may pick this product. Hopefully, we won't. The bill coming before us chooses this product to be the first product to receive major product liability protection--to say to the companies that have produced this product that kills people, is addictive, and was targeted on kids: you will not have to pay the full cost of the harm you have created because the U.S. 
Congress is going to protect you, the tobacco industry, from the liability that the marketplace would force on you were we to go directly to the capitalist system which has dominated our country for over 200 years. 
It is an absolute outrage that we are considering pursuing this course of action as a Congress. 
Equally significant, I think, is the fact that we are doing this in a manner where we are claiming that we are actually harming the tobacco companies. This argument is being made in the marketplace of ideas around here that this tobacco bill is somehow, in some way, an attack on big tobacco, when with the immunity language in it, it is just the opposite--it is a protective blanket. It is an iron curtain of protection for big tobacco. And it is ironic that we put this immunity language on the table at the same time the tobacco companies have said they no longer will participate in the development of this settlement. 
This immunity language was originally designed because we said if we didn't have immunity--or somebody said it; I didn't say it--it was said that if immunity did not exist for the tobacco industry, the tobacco industry would not come to the table and limit its advertising directed specifically at children. Now the tobacco industry has said: The heck with you guys. We don't like the bill, we are walking out, and we will have no more to do with this. So you don't limit us in any way on our advertising. And still we go forward with a bill that gives them immunity. 
And for the immunity, what do we get? A tobacco industry that has walked away from the table. To begin with, we made a deal with the devil--or somebody made a deal with the devil. Now the devil has walked away from the table, and we find that this Congress is thinking about following the devil on its knees and saying: Please, Mr. Devil, take immunity, take it; we want to throw it at you even if you won't give us anything for it. 
It is beyond comprehension that we are considering pursuing this course of action, but we appear to be considering that. I just wanted to highlight that at this point because I think the debate has gotten a little topsy-turvy. It is a little topsy-turvy when a bill is giving, for the first time in the history of our Nation, and in the jurisprudence history of our Nation, product liability protection of immense value to an industry that has produced a product that is inherently deadly and is addictive and is targeted on kids--the first time we are going to do that, and that bill is, for some reason, perceived as being antitobacco. 
It is not antitobacco. It is actually very protobacco. 
Let's remember something else here as we think about this. We don't give this type of protection out easily around here. It took 6 years, I think it was--maybe longer--for us to give just a narrow little amount of protection to the airplane manufacturing industry for small planes because our airplane industry had been wiped out for small planes and nobody could buy a small plane made in the United States back in the mid-1980s. The whole industry had been wiped out by product liability litigation. So we put a little sliver of protection in order to resurrect that industry. 
That industry does not produce an inherently deadly product that is addictive and that is targeted on kids. It took us 6 years to produce that little sliver of production. That is the only product liability protection passed by this Congress since I have been here. We don't give product liability protection to the doctor who develops and creates a new valve for somebody's heart which gives that person an extra amount of life, or a new hip design that allows a person to have the freedom to walk again. We don't give any protection to those individuals. If those valves don't work and regrettably a patient is harmed, there is a lawsuit, and there is recovery. We don't give any protection to innumerable, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of products that are lifesaving products that are produced for the purposes of bettering the life of an American citizen, or citizens around this world, whether it is a drug product, whether it is a medical device product, or whether it just happens to be an automobile. We don't give any product liability protection. But the first product liability protection we are going to give, if we pass this bill, will be to an industry that is producing and that has produced a product that for years--maybe generations even--it knew was deadly, it knew was addictive, and at least in the last 10 or 20 years it has targeted on kids for sale. It is beyond comprehension that we would consider doing that. 
As we move forward in this bill, I certainly hope that we will reconsider that proposal, because what are we getting for that immunity protection? Absolutely nothing. The tobacco companies walked away from the table. We have gotten nothing. And I hope that we would reconsider that. 
There will be a lot of talk about the fact, well, there is protection. It isn't really protection because there is a $6 billion, $8 billion--we don't know. We haven't seen the final language. The language is being written right now. It is being shifted around--I note for the press that might be listening, if there is any listening--shifting the language all around this bill, because it will be very difficult to target the immunity language in this bill. They are intentionally trying to make it procedurally very difficult to go after this language. But they keep shifting the numbers around, too. But the number is almost irrelevant because you are dealing with an industry that has the capacity to produce the profit to pick up the number. You would have to put out a fairly astronomical level to have any significant impact on the profitability over the long term of this industry. 
You are giving this industry, as long as you give them immunity, the right to go out in the marketplace and sell this product and target it on kids. That is what you are doing. You are giving them the right to sell a product that kills kids, kills people, is addictive, and is targeted on kids. It is just absolutely inexcusable that we would consider doing this. 
I certainly hope to be able to offer amendments that strip this out of the bill. It will be difficult because there are a lot of parliamentary games going on around here right now. But it would be my hope that we could accomplish that. 
Mr. President, I yield such time as I may have.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I know there are a number of Members who wish to speak, so I will keep my comments brief. But first I want to congratulate the chairman of the committee, Chairman Roth, for bringing forward this really excellent bill to try to address what have been some extraordinary abuses which have been testified to before his committee and testified to in other arenas. 
In my own case, I held a meeting in New Hampshire--a number of meetings, and found that we have had over 75 cases involving complaints involving the Internal Revenue Service since I have been in the Senate, which is an extremely high percentage. 
We held a number of meetings. In one of the meetings, we had a presentation that was really disturbing--two presentations, in fact. The first was a fellow who practiced tax law and tax preparation for over 27 years who brought in a memo, an actual memo that he had taken off the desk of an agent. And the memo stated very bluntly that the IRS agents in that arena, in that area, were to collect a specific amount of dollars. Not only were they to collect a specific amount of dollars, but they were to collect a specific amount of dollars every month. In fact, it went further. It said how much they were supposed to collect every day, almost down to every hour--how much money the agents in that area were supposed to collect. It was not collection on the basis of people who legitimately owed taxes; it was collection on the basis of a quota system. It was outrageous that such a memo should exist or such direction should occur with this agency. 
The second instance, which was even more disturbing because it led to a death, involved a fairly well known case now in New Hampshire of Mrs. Barron and Mr. Barron. Mrs. Barron's husband was essentially driven to suicide as a result of the abusive and totally inappropriate tactics that the Service, and a specific member of the Service, used in pursuing Mr. Barron for collection of taxes that were owed. 
It was so terrible and so outrageous that it did lead to Mr. Barron's death and has disrupted and destroyed really Mrs. Barron and her family. As of today--in fact, I believe it will be announced today--Mrs. Barron has now finally received, after 5 or 6 years, some slight recompensation from the Internal Revenue Service in that they have dropped all action against her and against her husband's estate, and stated that they will no longer pursue the liability which they originally alleged was due and which drove this family into such despair. The manner of the collection was just horrific. The way in which they proceeded was horrific. 
Of course, we have seen testimony before the Senate committee on which Chairman Roth has been holding hearings which reflected agents coming into slumber parties and forcing young children to get dressed in front of them, at gunpoint essentially, and throwing a household into chaos in that manner. 
Even a former majority leader of this Senate, Senator Baker, was subject to what amounted to extortion as a result of the activities of what I think was then a rogue agent pursuing Senator Baker. 
The instances go on and on. And almost every Member of this Senate, I suspect, has cases in their home State of abuse, of action taken by specific agents which went beyond anything which we in a democracy should tolerate. 
Thus, this bill is absolutely appropriate because this bill puts the taxpayer back on a level playing field. Instead of treating the taxpayers as if they are guilty until proven innocent--just the exact opposite of the way our culture proceeds--this bill puts the burden back on the Internal Revenue Service, where 
the taxpayer can present a reasonable case. 
In addition, this bill says to the spouse, who is just a bystander, that they will not end up being treated unfairly or abused as a result of the misdeeds of their husband. And in most instances where the spouse simply signs the return, the innocent spouse language in this bill is very, very appropriate. And the chance to recover from the IRS for damages which are caused as a result of excessive activity on the part of agents who may act outside the reasonable course of collection of taxes is also very appropriate in this bill. 
So this is truly a strong bill. It is dedicated to the purpose of trying to rein in the Internal Revenue Service management activities and make the Internal Revenue Service a more responsible agency as it deals with our citizenry. Because the bottom line, quite honestly, in our tax collection service, in our tax collection system as a democracy, is that people have to have confidence; they have to have confidence in the system. They have to have confidence that when they pay their taxes, they are paying, No. 1, their fair share and, No. 2, they are going to get fair treatment in the manner in which their taxes are reviewed. And as people lose that confidence, we will lose compliance. 
What we have seen basically is that people have lost their confidence in the manner in which the Internal Revenue Service pursues the collection of taxes in this country. This bill will hopefully move a large step down the road towards reestablishing faith in the collection process that we pursue in this Nation for our tax obligations. 
It does not get to the underlying problem, of course, which is that the tax laws have become far too complex, far too intricate, have gotten to a point of legal mumbo jumbo that very few people can understand what the tax laws actually say or can even comply with them without the assistance of professionals. That issue we also need to address as a Congress. 
We need to simplify, make fairer, make flatter our tax system; make it a more comprehensible and understandable tax system. Pending doing that, which I hope we will do in the next year or so, this bill is a major stride forward in giving the taxpayers fairer and better treatment under the Internal Revenue Service procedures and allowing taxpayers to be treated like citizens of a democracy rather than citizens of a police state. 
Mr. President, I yield back such time as I may have.

 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to women, men, and their families who are fighting the scourge of breast cancer. As many of my colleagues may remember, last Spring, I submitted S. Res. 85, with my fellow Senator from New Hampshire, recognizing the family and friends of breast cancer patients in the struggle to cope with this disease. The Senate passed my Resolution by unanimous consent and expressed their overwhelming support for individuals who provide strength and support for loved ones fighting breast cancer. I come to the floor today to again note the importance of this expression and to recognize a very important organization in my home state of New Hampshire that is spreading this message to breast cancer patients across the country. 
The American Cancer Society estimates that in 1998, 178,700 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed among women in the United States and 1,600 cases will be diagnosed among men. These numbers more than triple in size when you consider the family and friends who are also impacted by the disease. With each and every one of these cases comes family and friends who are looked upon to provide the caring and loving needed to overcome such a terrifying disease. 
The Northeast Health Care Quality Foundation, in Dover, New Hampshire, has done an excellent job of expressing this notion to the people of New Hampshire and beyond. With their campaign titled, `It's My Fight, Too,' the Foundation has let individuals afflicted with breast cancer know that they are not alone in their struggle. It is important for the family to understand that their feelings are shared by others in their same situation and that they should find strength in numbers. 
Awareness campaigns like `It's My Fight Too,' are extremely important to foster an environment where support for both the individual with breast cancer and their family and friends is encouraged. Awareness is the key to allowing people to understand and identify with those suffering around them. We can all, as community members, provide support and strength to those in need. 
As Mother's Day approaches, the Northeast Health Care Quality Foundation will be holding their annual event to recognize the important women in our lives who may or may not be suffering from this disease but who never the less, need to know that breast cancer is not just a women's disease but a struggle that can be fought by all of us together. Their event, `Family and Friends Against Breast Cancer, It's My Fight Too, A Night of Hope, Song and Love' will bring people from across the Northeast together to express the same support the Senate expressed with the passage of S. Res. 85. I commend the efforts of the Northeast Health Care Quality Foundation and encourage organizations across the country to follow their leadership and example.

Mr. GREGG. I thank the floor leader, and I wish to congratulate the floor leader for his excellent work in moving this bill forward. This is a very important piece of legislation for improving the quality of education in this 
country, and specifically for empowering parents to have more of a role in choosing how their child is educated and being sure their children have the resources to obtain the type of education which parents want for their kids. It really is not a radical idea. It is a very reasonable idea. So reasonable it is hard to understand why there would be opposition to allowing parents to be able to save more, to use that savings for the benefit of their children, to educate their children. So I certainly congratulate the Senator from Georgia for his excellent work in bringing this legislation. 
I wanted to speak on a couple of specifics and then generally on the bill. There was an opportunity which I was going to undertake, along with Senator Gorton, to offer an amendment to try to clarify some of the issues relative to IDEA, especially in the questions dealing with the teacher role, in dealing with children who have special education needs but turn out to be violent. We did pass the IDEA reauthorization bill last year, which I worked hard on. I was proud to participate in it. 
Unfortunately, the Department of Education has not followed the rather explicit instructions from the Congress on how regulations should be issued under this bill. As a result, the question of how we deal with the school situation involving a child who is a physical threat to other children in the classroom and to the teacher has not been properly addressed. My amendment would have addressed that. It was an amendment which I worked on. Senator Gorton was the prime mover of such an amendment earlier last year, although it was the same amendment. 
The issue here, of course, is making sure that such language, should it be brought forward, does not allow school systems to in any arbitrary or capricious or inappropriate way bar the special-needs child from the classroom. That would be absolutely unacceptable. 
I headed up a school that dealt with special-needs children, and I understand, I think, this issue as well as anyone who is addressing it here in this Senate. I am very sensitive to the importance of making sure that nothing happens which would undermine the capacity of the child who is mainstream, and who is gaining from that mainstream experience, to receive that experience they have under the law. 
There is also a need to address the fact that in instances of true physical violence, teachers, principals, other children in the classroom, find themselves sometimes put in a position where they have no way of adequately dealing with a child who is a physical threat to them. In fact, there have been a lot of instances which reflect this problem. 
Without the Department of Education addressing the issue, which it should have addressed, it is probably going to be appropriate to address the issue in some other form such as this. We decided not to move forward on that because we did not want to complicate this bill any further than it had already been complicated, and therefore we--Senator Gorton and myself--reserved our amendment on that point. 
I must say, the special education community, which I have worked with rather aggressively over the years--I have been probably their greatest champion on a number of issues, specifically on getting funding and on working on the last bill--has reacted, I think, overreacted to the proposal. They did not see the proposal. They simply characterized it and went forth to inform their constituency--misinform their constituency would be more accurate--as to what it would have done, which is ironic and inappropriate considering the support I have given that community. 
On the second point, which was the number of amendments which we saw here which were an attempt to basically move dollars from this Coverdell approach from the A+ plan into special education, 
a number of amendments were brought forth, and specifically the Dodd amendment, which I wanted to address because I didn't have a chance in the 15-minute limitation of time to respond on these points. I have led this fight in the Senate now for 3 years--well, actually since I got here, but I have actually been successful over the last 3 years--to try to increase funding for special education. The Federal Government made a commitment that it would do 40 percent of the cost in special education. When I arrived here, having served as Governor, that commitment was not being fulfilled. In fact, the Federal Government was only doing about 6 percent of the cost of special education. 
The fact that the Federal Government was failing to do its share of special education costs was having a disproportionate and unfair impact on the local school systems, and it was especially, in my opinion, putting the special-needs child and the parents of the special-needs child in an untenable position in local school board meetings, where they were being looked at as siphoning off resources from other activities of the school systems. They had every right to those resources, but unfortunately because the Federal Government wasn't paying the cost of that education, those resources had to come from other places. So the Federal Government has been totally irresponsible in this area of funding special education. 
As a result of my efforts and the efforts of Senator Lott, first we passed a commitment to fully fund special education to 40 percent, and we followed that up with making the Budget Act make that statement, and followed it up by having the first bill put forth by the Republican Senate being S. 1, a commitment to full funding for special education. Then we followed all those words up with hard dollars. Two years ago, we increased the funding of special education by almost $700 million. We followed that up with another almost $700 million--I think it is over $700 million in the first year. We have dramatically increased funding in special education, not as far as we need to go, but we have done that. The Republicans did that. We had no support from the administration on this initiative and only marginal support when it came to the actual votes on those budgets from the other side of the aisle on this initiative. 
So we have a track record of having delivered on this issue. The great irony here--another great irony--is that the amendments brought forth by the other side of the aisle were paper amendments meant to paper over, I think, the irresponsibility of this administration and the other side of the aisle on the issue of special ed because, once again, just a few weeks ago when we passed the budget in this body, we saw that the administration and the other side of the aisle were not willing to put their name on the line on the cause of special education and funding special education. 
The Republican budget increases special education by $2.5 billion. I don't think any Democrats--or maybe one or two--only a small number of Democrats voted for that budget. The President's budget that was brought forward and voted on in committee increased special education funding by a measly $35 million--$35 million. That was basically a nonexistent event that would have probably been used for administrative overhead down at the Department of Education. That $35 million probably would never have seen the light of day in any school system. 
So we made the commitment, and when it came to casting the vote, we cast the vote to increase special education funding. Now this cause has been taken up by the Speaker of the House, 
who talked about this, and the chairman of the House committee on this issue, and again the majority leader is aggressively pursuing it as well as myself. We intend to fulfill our obligations for special education funding as a Congress under Republican leadership. 
So when we saw these amendments coming at us, we had to almost smile at the political grandstanding of it because that is what they were, just political grandstanding. If those folks really want to fund special education, we are going to give them the chance to do that. We are going to be bringing bills out here that do that. I wish they had been there on the budget amendment. Please take those votes and those amendments for what they were, which was trying to paper over their own lack of effort in this area in the face of what was a hard action on our part of delivering hard dollars out to the school systems for assistance to special education. 
On the bill overall, what we have here is a choice between the status quo--and I have heard basically almost an unlimited defense of the status quo from those folks who oppose this piece of legislation--and people who want to empower parents to have more of a role in the education of their children. Now, I know that money is a factor in education. We all know that. I know that the building is a factor in education. I know that the number of kids in a classroom is a factor in education. I will tell you something. In my experience, and I think probably in the experience of anybody who is going to be honest, the single most significant impact on a child's education is the parental involvement and the parental activity. What this bill does is it brings the parents into the process more aggressively. It gives the parents a new tool to be able to help their children out as they try to move through this maze of education which we thrust at them. 
Why would we not want to do that? Well, I can't think of any reason. This is a parent-empowering amendment and proposal. The opposition really comes from people who seem to think that this threatens the status quo. That is where the opposition is coming from. They see this as a threat to some structure that presently exists out there. That has been the basic underlying theme of the opposition. Well, is the status quo so good? Is it so extraordinary and doing such a wonderful job that it should not be shaken a little bit? This is not a big shaking up; it's just sort of a little vibration. I am not sure this would appear on the Richter scale, but it is a significant and good step. It is a good step, but it is not a dramatic shaking up of the status quo. I can think of some things we should do to dramatically shake up the status quo, and hopefully we will. But this is a step in the right direction. It is a parent-empowering step, confronting the defenders of the status quo on education. 
I have to tell you, the status quo in education isn't cutting it. We know that as a society. Parents know it. Businesses that are trying to hire people coming out of our educational system know it. Regrettably, the world is seeing it. We have gotten to a point really where, in many instances, in many of our most cutting industries that are producing the jobs in this country, they are having to hire people from outside of the country because they don't have the educational expertise to do it, or they don't have enough educational expertise in this country. So the status quo is not working. We need to take some new, original approaches. Clearly, the proposal before us, the A+ accounts, is an attempt to empower parents to do something, to give parents an opportunity to do something to help their kids get a better education. What an appropriate purpose that is. 
We had a whole series of amendments and other ideas on how we should improve education. We had an amendment to build more schools, an amendment to change the teacher ratios, and an amendment to do after-school planning. These were all nice ideas, but they don't belong in this body. These are ideas that belong in a school board meeting. If these Senators want these ideas to move forward, they should go back home to their school board meeting and suggest it. These are local control issues. We should not be taking resources out of the local community, sending it to Washington, draining it off from the one program in Washington that we are not funding, which is special ed, which should be funded, and sending it back to the community and say that they have to do this or that with those dollars. You have to build a building, or you have to cut down your class size, or you have to do an after-school program with those dollars. That is a local control issue. That is where it belongs, in the local school board. They make those decisions. 
Let's give the local communities the flexibility to have the resources, and let's give them the resources to have the flexibility to make decisions as to whether they want a new school building or new art course or a foreign language course, or whether they want a new teacher who teaches some sort of high-grade technical computer science. 
The local school board knows best on that. But for us here in Washington to basically be taking the resources out of the local community by not fully funding special education and then telling the local school board that we are going to send the resources back covered with strings and directions, and, by the way, all of the things the local school board traditionally has control over, but we decide to take them over in Washington because we know better than you do. It is absurd. But it is classic Washington. I am glad that all of those items were defeated because they should have been defeated. Let's defeat them and send them back to the local school board. 
Again, I congratulate the Senator from Georgia. He has brought forward a concept and an idea that is going to empower the parents to be able to help their kids get a better education. I cannot think of any better sentiment or any better purpose for any bill. I look forward to its final passage. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas. 
First, the underlying purpose of the amendment is legitimate. The fact is that these companies buy this opportunity to go on to Federal land at basically zero dollars. They make millions, billions of dollars over the years off of this land. They pay no depletion. They pay no taxes. They get a depletion allowance that gives them a tax deduction even though they didn't have to pay anything for the land to begin with, which makes absolutely no sense. The depletion allowance is the concept that you are using up an asset which you paid something for. They didn't pay anything for the land, so why should they get a depletion allowance? 
The Senator's amendment on the facts on substance is correct. More importantly, the Senator's amendment is taking this totally inappropriate deduction and applying the revenues which would occur by eliminating it to something which is totally appropriate, and that is special education. We all know that this administration has, regrettably, underfunded special education in its budget. We have attempted to correct that in the Republican budget, but we haven't gotten as far as we need to go. Thus this opportunity to put an additional revenue stream into special education is extraordinarily important. It means that kids who are in the special needs program, who are today being pushed into a position with other kids who are not in special needs programs over a confrontation of resources, will be put in less of a situation which is detrimental to them. 
The Federal Government committed to pay 40 percent of the costs of the special needs child. As a result of Republican initiatives, we have gotten from a 6 percent level to a 9.5 percent level, but we are still well short of the 40 percent commitment. This amendment by the Senator from Arkansas will help us move another step toward that 40 percent commitment. It will help relieve local taxpayers who are paying the Federal share of the tax burden of supporting special needs children from having to pay the difference between 9.5 percent and 40 percent, or some part of that. 
So, essentially, the proposal of the Senator from Arkansas 
is right on two counts. First, it is right on the concept of eliminating the depletion allowance because there is absolutely no justification for a depletion allowance where people pay essentially nothing for the lands they are mining and the land is owned by the public. Secondly, it is right because it will help special needs children and it will start to fulfill or assist in fulfilling the obligation of the Federal Government to fund the 40 percent share which we said we would fund when we started this program. 
It is a good amendment. I strongly support it.

Mr. GREGG. I rise today to discuss efforts that were made to insert assumptions into the Budget Resolution that would hurt the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary (CJS) Subcommittee. Those assumptions sought to amend the securities legislation that we negotiated with the Senate Banking Committee and House Commerce Committee in 1996. Specifically, they assume reductions in NASDAQ transaction fees. The result being that the Appropriations Committee pick up the cost of $73 million. 
Prior to 1996, the 6(b) fees were paid by corporations to register securities. Some interests felt that the 6(b) fees had grown too large. During negotiations with the White House and the authorizing committees it was agreed that over the next ten years 6(b) fees would be reduced. The creation of the NASDAQ transaction fees was a concession made to the CJS subcommittee as part of a larger compromise that led to a phasing out of the Section 6(b) registration fees. The intent was to minimize the impact on the Appropriations process. 
Since 1934, Section 31 transaction fees had been imposed on exchange listed securities but not on those sold in the Over the Counter (OTC) market. As part of the agreement in 1996, extending the section 31 fee to the OTC market allowed the 6(b) registration fees to be reduced while retaining adequate fee collections to support and offset the SEC's appropriation. 
In arriving at the compromise that resulted in the ten year funding mechanism, it was acknowledged that surpluses over the SEC's funding would likely exist until the end of the ten year schedule. After that time the SEC was to be fully funded by direct appropriations.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague, Senator John Breaux, in delivering a statement as to why we support the sense of the Senate language put forth by the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth. 
For the past year, Senator Breaux and I have co-chaired the National Commission on Retirement Policy, convened by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Our task is to review the situation facing our Nation with respect to retirement income in the 21st century. 
We will soon be releasing a final report of our findings and recommendations, and we need not preview them here in detail. Suffice to say that each of the major sources of retirement income--Social Security, employer-provided pensions, and personal savings--will be under severe strain in the 21st century, as a consequence of the aging of our population, and the declining ratio of workers to retirees. 
The situation facing Social Security is sufficiently dire to command our immediate attention. We, as co-chairs of the NCRP, wrote to President Clinton last December, urging him to make this issue a priority in his state of the union address, and we were extremely pleased that he did so. Social Security will begin running operating deficits in the year 2012 under current law, and even if the $2.89 trillion that the Federal Government will owe Social Security is repaid in full, the Trust Fund would still run dry in the year 2029. The unfunded liabilities of the Social Security--the gap between projected outlays and projected revenues--is on the order of $3 trillion. The true `unfunded liability,' however, is much greater, because those taxes haven't been collected yet, and therefore all of the future liabilities of the program are in a sense unfunded, to be financed from tax revenue at the time that they are paid. 
We have carefully studied this problem for a year, and we believe that there are several problems that must be solved simultaneously. The actuarial soundness of Social Security is but one of these. There is also a huge problem residing in the size of the tax burden that is awaiting the future economy if we do not advance fund some of Social Security's future liabilities. A solution to this problem is no solution at all if it achieves actuarial soundness at the price of an unfair tax burden on tomorrow's economy, or at the price of further worsening the quality of the deal that today's young workers will receive from the Social Security program. 
It is for this reason that Senator Breaux and I believe that personal accounts must be a component of the Social Security solution. Tough choices will need to be made in order to bring the outlays and the revenues of Social Security back into balance, and we believe that personal accounts should be established within this context. Creating a funded savings account component within the Social Security system is perhaps the only way to give something back to today's young workers to improve their treatment by the Social Security system relative to a set of traditional solutions alone. This is one way that we have found to prevent the income provided by the Social Security system from declining below the level that we expect from the program. 
Before turning to Senator Breaux, let me also note the flexibility of Senator Roth's language with regard to the administration of such accounts. This language does not commit the Senate to any particular method of administration. Senator Breaux and I, after a year of study, have reached the conclusion that the best way to administer personal accounts is through the existing payroll tax collection system. That money is already being paid in a timely way by employers on behalf of individual employees, and is a structure that we can practicably work through to set up accounts in every wage-earner's name through a refund of some portion of the payroll tax. The Roth language is flexible enough to permit a variety of approaches to administering the accounts, as it should be. I hope that Senators who differ as to the best administrative mechanism will be able to unite behind it.

<TEXT>
Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, a number of points have been made by the Senator from North Dakota. He always makes them well. Even when I disagree with him, I enjoy listening to him. 
Let me point out a few things that I want to talk about initially relative to this budget that, if you were to listen to the other side, you might not fully understand, because there appears to be an incomplete explanation. 
For example, on the issue of education, the Senator from North Dakota used the term: `The Federal Government has niches which it is responsible for in the area of funding education.' I think that is a good term, `niches.' The Federal Government does not have responsibility for the overall funding of elementary and secondary school education. In fact, that has always been reserved to the local community, and should be reserved to the local community. It should be parents and teachers who are empowered, controlling their schools by controlling their local dollars. 
But yes, we do have some niches that we are interested in as the Federal Government. Probably the primary niche we are interested in is taking care of the special-needs child. In fact, we have a law called 94-142, otherwise known as IDEA, the purpose of which is to make sure the special-needs children get adequate funding as they try to get decent schooling. When this law was passed, the Federal Government said it would pay 40 percent of the cost. Regrettably, the Federal Government, as of 2 years ago, was only paying about 6 percent of the cost. But as a result of the leadership of people on our side of the aisle, myself included, and Senator Lott and a number of other people--Senator Collins from Maine--we have aggressively pursued trying to increase the funding for special education, and we have gotten it up to about 9.5 percent of the local cost. But it still remains the single largest unfunded mandate the Federal Government puts on local school districts and basically has the effect of saying to the local school district: You must educate these children. The Federal Government said it will pay 40 percent. We are not going to pay our 40 percent. Therefore, you must use your local tax dollars to pay the Federal share, and therefore you have very little flexibility in how you use your local tax dollars, because the Federal Government is requiring you to use them to educate children to pay for costs which the Federal Government was supposed to pay for in the first place. 
Well, the administration has been grotesquely lax in its fulfillment of this obligation also. When the Senator from North Dakota says the administration has all these wonderful new education initiatives--they are going to go out and build schools and reduce class sizes, they are going to add proposals and programs for after-school education--what they do not mention--what they do not mention--is the administration, the White House, the President, and the Democratic Members of this Congress, in their own budget as proposed, failed to increase at all, for all intents and purposes, funding for special-ed kids. They failed to even make a minor attempt to try to fulfill the obligation of the special-ed child, something that we are by law required to do. 
So, yes, the Federal Government has niches in education. One of those primary niches, which we have cited, by law, is that we will pay 40 percent of the cost of the special-needs child. We don't do it. The Democratic Membership is unwilling to do it. The White House is unwilling to do it. Why? They want to take all kinds of new programs to take care of new constituencies to generate new press releases. It is about time they lived up to the obligation on the books. Our budget, the Republican budget, does that. It moves one more time aggressively--in fact, outlines $2.5 billion of new spending for special education over the next 5 years--with a strong, firm commitment to try to get to that 40 percent, something that is totally ignored on the other side. 
So, when you wanted to talk education, the Republican budget lives up to the obligation of the Congress, the Federal Government, in the area of education. The Democratic proposals just put out press releases and try to buy new constituencies and do nothing for the special-needs child. Basically, they failed in that arena. 
Now we go to the issue of the tobacco settlement, and that is what I want to talk about primarily here today. The tobacco 
settlement is obviously a very complex and intricate piece of process. But there should be some black-letter rules that guide us in this settlement. The Senator in the chair has been a leader on identifying one of these black-letter rules, which is that attorneys should not get an outrageous amount of income out of these settlements. The billions of dollars in attorney's fees that are being awarded in Texas and Florida are just obscene, obscene. They are going out of the pockets of the taxpayer into the attorneys' pockets, and they are not doing anything for anybody. Clearly, there should be some action taken in that arena. That should be a black-letter law addressing this issue, and I congratulate the Senator in the chair for his leadership on that count. 
Equally, we ought to recognize what the problems are that are created for the Federal Government as a result of tobacco smoking. The single biggest problem we have as a Federal Government as a result of tobacco smoking from a health standpoint is that senior citizens are disproportionately impacted by the health impacts of smoking all their life, and that impact on senior citizens flows directly back to the cost being on the Federal Treasury in the Medicare system. So it is perfectly reasonable and appropriate and right, to the extent that the Federal Government receives revenues as a result of this tobacco settlement, that those revenues should go to support the primary cost which the Federal Government incurs as a result of tobacco smoking in this country, which is the cost to take care of our senior citizens. 
I point out, the other side of the aisle suddenly has decided to spend this tobacco settlement money on all sorts of new initiatives for a panoply of new constituencies and programs, the purpose of which appears to be once again to create press releases rather than create substantive progress. I point out to the other side, it was just a year ago we saw from the other side such crocodile tears, it now appears--because they wouldn't be genuine tears or they would be supporting us in this matter--crocodile tears about their concern for the trust fund, Medicare trust fund, and how it was being raided, they alleged, by the Republican side of the aisle. 
We made a firm, unalterable commitment to Medicare. We recognize on our side that Medicare remains probably the single most difficult entitlement program, from the standpoint of fiscal solvency, that we have on the books. Social Security is a tough one, but Medicare is even tougher. If we are going to address it effectively, we do need those revenues from the tobacco settlement in order to make sure that our seniors have a legitimate health insurance program. 
So this proposal that we have in this budget to put the money into Medicare is the most logical place that it should go. It should not go to some new program that the President announces. Every day, he seems to announce a new program on the basis of the tobacco settlement. There was a week where I think literally every day of the week he announced a new program. 
Let's support the programs we have on the books, both in education and in health care. 
The tobacco settlement raises other issues, issues that I am concerned about. I read in the papers about the movement toward an agreement on the tobacco settlement. From my standpoint, I find the issue of immunity to be really the core issue of how this settlement comes down. Of course, it is the issue of immunity which the tobacco companies are trying to buy as they try to settle this lawsuit--this situation; it is not a lawsuit. It is a lawsuit in some areas but not a lawsuit at the Federal level. They are trying to buy immunity, and I have a lot of problems with that, and I should think any thinking Americans would have a lot of problems with that. 
Basically, what we would be doing if we give the tobacco companies immunity--remember that we as a Congress have been unwilling to give product liability protection, not immunity, just plain little old protection to company after company that functions across this country producing legitimate products that make sense for the American people, that they use regularly and that they need, whether it happens to be your toaster oven, or whether it happens to be some gadget in your car, or whether it happens to be some other item--your computer screen. Company after company which has sought product liability reform in this Congress has met with a stone wall. The only product liability we have given in this Congress over the last 10 years has been for the small plane producer, which was a very good decision, and it has worked great for them. 
For every other industry in this country, legitimate industries producing legitimate products that are used daily by Americans and that benefit Americans--benefit Americans--we have said no, absolutely no product liability protection. 
Yet, the tobacco companies come to us--the producers of a product which, by its very nature, causes an addiction which it appears the tobacco companies knew caused an addiction, the purpose of which was to not only addict Americans generally but specifically targeted at our kids to addict them to something that will kill them--when the tobacco companies come to us, we say, `Oh, maybe we should give them immunity.' 
What great irony. What incredible irony. We won't give immunity to the person who is making the toaster oven or the person who is making the computer or the person who is maybe making the device that allows somebody to live longer and live a better life, but we will give immunity to companies which are producing a product the purpose of which is to kill people, addict people and specifically targeted on our kids. I just find it incredible--incredible--that we would be considering that. 
What is the argument for giving immunity? `Well, if we don't give them immunity, the tobacco companies won't agree to advertising restraints.' That is the only thing they give us for their immunity. We allow them to continue to produce a product which is inherently deadly, which is addictive, and what do we get? We get a little less of Joe Camel. What a great deal that is for the American people and for this Congress. It is absurd. Yes, we can't put limitations on their advertising without their agreeing to it because of the first amendment, in many ways, but there are limitations we can put on that are within the first amendment. 
More importantly, we could act unilaterally as a Congress in all the other areas of this tobacco settlement, whether it has to be raising the cost of cigarettes so they become less marketable--which is exactly what we should do--whether it happens to be addressing the issues of immunity, or whether it happens to be initiating our own counteradvertising campaign, and certainly the Government of the United States has the capacity, the will and the dollars to do that without any question in a manner that will be equally effective. I will be happy to go into the arena of advertising and debate the issue. 
We can do everything in this tobacco settlement without 
granting immunity, but by granting immunity, we get virtually nothing. All we get is the tobacco companies agreeing to advertising limits. To me, it is inherently inconsistent and affronts the logic of the institution for us to be having our first major product liability protection flow to companies, flow to an industry which is producing a product the purpose of which is to addict people, specifically children, with the knowledge that it will kill them. It makes no sense. 
For that reason, I am offering a sense-of-the-Senate amendment on the issue of immunity. 
I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what this amendment says is it is the sense of the Senate that we won't grant immunity. Really this is a very simple vote for people. You can either come down on the side of setting the worst precedent I can imagine, which would be that the first major product liability reform in this country would be immunity, total absolute immunity, for all intents and purposes, granted to tobacco companies in exchange for their paying us money which we could obtain, if we decided to go that route, through some other policy without having to grant immunity. 
The same amount of revenue can be generated a number of other ways without their agreement for advertising restraints, which means little to us, because we can address the advertising in other forums. For those two reasons, we grant immunity and, in the process, give a product which, as I mentioned a number of times, is inherently harmful, addictive, and aimed at our children and kills you, protection from lawsuits. It makes no sense. 
Thus, I think the Congress should speak on this. I know a number of committees in the Congress are addressing this issue right now. They are negotiating through the process. But I believe we should as a Congress, as a Senate, speak on it early so that we lay out the framework of this debate early. If Members feel there is some value from giving immunity, let them vote that way. From my point of view, there is no value in giving this type of immunity. I just don't think the pluses outweigh the minuses in any sense of the word. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I certainly appreciate the support of the Senator from North Dakota on this amendment. I believe he has summarized the concern which I have as well. The fact is you can't defend immunity. It is just inconsistent with the policies of discovery to give immunity to a business which has basically targeted young people with an addictive product which was intended to kill them. The idea that we would start by giving immunity to that industry is not only ironic but totally wrong. 
So I certainly appreciate the support of the Senator from North Dakota in this effort.

Mr. GREGG. Well, I don't rise in opposition to the substance of what the Senator from New Jersey has said. I think he has made the argument for his case very effectively. Certainly, this is a major issue for him and his State--cleaning up of this superfund site. 
What we are dealing with here, however, is the fact that we have been contacted by the Attorney General. Obviously, I am not the spokesman for the administration, and I would not put myself in the position of the other party, but I believe we have an obligation when we are contacted by the Attorney General. She has expressed her strong opposition to having this sense of the Senate passed during the pendency of the negotiation and litigation of this case. I think she has a very legitimate procedural position. 
Now, again, I am not arguing the equities of this or the substance of the question. I am arguing that it would be inappropriate, as she represents, for the Congress to express the sense of the Senate, which would then put the administration--specifically, the Attorney General--in the difficult position of having the Congress interject itself in the middle of what are ongoing negotiations relative to the settlement in this case. 
Let me read briefly from her letter: 
The Department of Justice opposes this amendment, which is intended to influence the department in its conduct of the pending litigation. 
That is essentially a summary of the letter. It goes on to explain why the Department thinks that this will affect the litigation as it goes forward. So I rise with significant reservation about this because I recognize that the Senator from New Jersey has a very strong feeling and is trying to put forward his constituents' feelings. I believe we would be setting a very difficult, very inappropriate precedent as a Congress if we start interjecting ourselves into issues of negotiation in active litigation, where we have been advised by the Attorney General of the United States that that would negatively or inappropriately impact that litigation. 
From that standpoint, I have to rise in opposition to this sense of the Senate, with all due respect to the Senator from New Jersey, who I think clearly has made his case well. In light of the letter from the Attorney General, I believe it would be inappropriate to proceed at this time.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would have to say at the outset that I believe the certification process is a mistake because clearly it isn't working. But the fact is that as long as we have it, we ought to have integrity in it. And the fact is that, if we are going to look at the question of whether or not there has been an effort to comply that meets the terms of the certification process by Mexico, we would have to conclude that they have failed. 
We can wish that they had complied. We can hope that they had complied. We can say as a matter of public policy we truly wanted them to comply. But the fact is that they have not complied. To claim they have complied is to delude ourselves. Essentially it would be the same as suggesting that the Red Sox are going to win the World Series. We want it to happen, but we know it isn't going to happen. The fact is that Mexico and the core elements that are necessary for us to pursue the drug war in Mexico have been undermined by the cartels which earn so much money from the sale of drugs. 
The real problem here isn't Mexico, though. The real problem is ourselves. We could use that phrase, `We have met the enemy and it is us.' The fact is that our consumption of narcotics has corrupted not only much of the mechanism of Mexico but has corrupted the mechanism of Belize, Colombia, a series of countries in the Central American area, Peru, and in the Caribbean. We, as a nation, should truly be ashamed of what we are doing to these nations. 
Were I a Mexican or were I a citizen of Belize or Colombia or Peru, or a citizen of many of our Caribbean neighbors, I would be angered and outraged at the fact that my nation and the government of my nation, as a result of the demand for drugs in this country, the United States, has become so debilitated. It is really our utilization of those drugs which has undermined those nations. But the fact is that we do have the certification process, and the integrity of the certification process requires that we at least comply with its terms. Under the terms of the certification process, there is no way that we should be certifying Mexico. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will go into this amendment in more depth after the Senator from North Carolina has proceeded with the core of discussing his basic amendment. Essentially what this amendment does--the underlying amendment takes the money from the stabilization fund and puts it toward school construction. Instead of putting it all towards school construction, this amendment puts $1 billion of it towards special education. We as a Government have an obligation to special needs children. I have discussed that on the floor many times. We have made a 40 percent commitment as a Government that, regrettably, is an unfunded mandate that has not been fulfilled. We are only paying 9 percent of the local cost. This would help pick up the 40 percent, move towards that 40 percent, and that is the purpose of this amendment. 
I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from North Carolina. As I understand it, he does not object to this second-degree amendment. I look forward to hearing this discussion of his underlying amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I know the Feingold amendment is pending, but I want to speak to the issue of the Faircloth amendment which was offered earlier and which I understand will be resumed and possibly voted on later this afternoon, specifically to my second-degree amendment to the Faircloth amendment. 
The second degree says that of the $5 billion that would be taken from the stabilization fund--which is, I believe, essentially a fund that allows the Treasury the flexibility to do things like Mexico bailout and the bailouts in Asia, of the $5 billion that Senator Faircloth has suggested we take back into the Treasury to take control over, which I think is a good idea--that $1 billion of that would go towards special education. 
As many people who have listened to me speak occasionally on this floor know--or some people know because I suspect many don't listen or would rather ignore it--the special education funding accounts of this Government are totally skewed in that when the bill for special education was first passed back in 1976, the Federal Government said it would pick up 40 percent of the costs of the special needs child in the local school districts. Over the years, the Federal Government has failed miserably in fulfilling its obligations, and instead of paying for 40 percent of costs, as of 2 years ago it was down to paying for only 6 percent of the costs of the special needs child. 
As a result of efforts by a number of Senators, including myself and Senator Lott and the Presiding Officer, we have been able in the last 2 years on the Republican side to significantly increase funding for special education, with no support, by the way, from the administration, to the point where we now have it up to approximately 9.5 percent of the costs of the special education being borne by the Federal Government--still a far cry from the 40 percent. 
The administration has put forward a budget this year which calls for virtually no increase in special education funds, which is an outrageous position in light of the fact that they are also suggesting we create new programs in the elementary and secondary school level that would cost approximately $12 billion. But they can find no room in their budget for special education for kids who need special education, which is truly inappropriate. 
What has happened is the special needs child finds himself put in a situation where in local school district after local school district that child is really in an untenable and unfair position relative to other children in the school system. The parents of that child are forced to be put in confrontation with the children and parents who do not have special needs, in different school systems, in a competition for resources, in a competition for resources which should be there if the Federal Government paid its fair share but which are not because the Federal Government does not pay its fair share. 
This administration, in suggesting $12 billion in new programs outside of special needs funding, is essentially saying we are not only not going to fund the needs of the special education to the level required by the law; we are going to take money which would relieve the pressure on the special education child, which would relieve the pressure on the local school district, we will take that money and create new programs, new mandated programs, new categorical programs where the local school districts will have to do what we say they have to do in Washington in the area of buildings and in the area of class size at the expense of the special needs child, one more time. 
If this money was put where it was supposed to be under the law, the 40 percent as the Federal Government is supposed to pay for it, if the President's budget funded special education at the level that it was required to be funded under the law, then those new programs, instead of being started in buildings, instead of being started in class size, those dollars would flow to the special education accounts and the local school districts could make the decisions because they would then have their resources freed up as to what type of buildings they wanted, what type of courts they wanted, and the decision process would be controlled where it should be--at the local level, not here in Washington. 
But that is not the policy of this administration. The policy of this administration is to essentially try to take control over local education, pull it into Washington through these categorical grant programs, and, at the same time, underfund the special needs program, putting the local school districts in the lose-lose position of having to pay the Federal share of special needs and they also have to do what the Federal Government wants it to do in other areas in order to get any Federal money at all--totally inappropriate and extremely prejudicial, especially to the local school districts and the special needs. 
That is a long explanation, but it is an attempt to lay the groundwork for the purpose of my amendment. If we are going to bring more money back into the Federal Treasury under the control of Congress, which we should--and I think Senator Faircloth's amendment is appropriate in this area--we should not have this, for want of a better word, `slush fund' sitting there for the purposes and under the control of the Congress to spend, the $5 billion. If we are going to bring that $5 billion back into the control of the Congress, not only should we bring it back here, but we should spend it on obligations that we know we have, which are on the books and, specifically, special education. 
So the vote on this Faircloth amendment really becomes fairly simple. To put it in its starkest terms, you can vote for a slush fund that may be used to bail out the Soeharto family, which is worth billions and billions of dollars in Indonesia, or you can vote for the special-ed child back in your hometown and your home State who needs the support of this Government and whom this Government said they were going to support. That is the vote. The choice is simple. I certainly hope that this Senate will come down on the side of special education. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

If I could continue that line of questioning, if you were to support your amendment, you would be protecting the surplus for Social Security, or hopefully for Social Security, but at least this spending which is incurred as a result of this proposal would come under the budget process in the manner which would require it be accounted for in the caps and therefore it would not impact the surplus.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from North Carolina for his amendment, because it clearly outlines the problems which we have as a Congress with the representations that we continue to hear from the United Nations and some of the member nations within the United Nations relative to the obligations of the U.S. arrearages and, as we go into the future, relative to the obligations for the payment of the operation of the United Nations and the payment for the international organizations for the United Nations and the payment for peacekeeping. 
The fact is that the United States and the taxpayers of this country, to whom we answer, have been extremely generous with the United Nations--extremely generous. We have undertaken as a nation far more--far more--than our fair 
share of the costs of initiatives which the United Nations is pursuing, and we are today undertaking far more than is our fair share, both in Southwest Asia and also in Bosnia. 
This supplemental appropriations bill has in it $1.9 billion, the purpose of which is to try to put our Defense Department into a position of solvency, for lack of a better term, relative to the costs of these peacekeeping missions, so that we are not culling, draining from our core defense establishment, funds necessary to maintain that establishment in order to undertake these peacekeeping initiatives in two areas where the United Nations has a primary role and has been one of the primary promoters. That is why we are pursuing this supplemental appropriations. 
But it is part of a larger picture, and the Senator from North Carolina has outlined it and pointed out rather precisely the dollars involved and the commitments we have made just in these two areas. 
I want to highlight a couple of points, because I am very tired, as chairman of the appropriating subcommittee that has responsibility for the U.N. accounts--I am very tired of hearing this constant moaning from New York, from members of the United Nations, about American arrears. Let's look at what those arrears are. 
Only $54 million--$54 million--a small number in the context of the entire budget, although a big number in the context of a small State like New Hampshire and certainly a very expensive number for the people of New Hampshire because that is coming out of our taxes--only $54 million goes to the operation of the United Nations of the alleged arrears that are presented to us. 
Of the total arrearage--and the debate is out there as to whether it is $600 million, $900 million, or $1.2 billion--of that total arrearage, only $54 million goes to operating accounts within the United Nations. The vast majority of the balance--there are a couple of international organizations involved here--but the vast majority of the balance flows through the United Nations to other nations to reimburse them for their peacekeeping costs. 
Let me list a few of these: France alleges it is owed $151 million; Italy alleges it is owed $62 million; Belgium, $58 million; The Netherlands, $50 million; India, $47 million; Pakistan, $45 million; Russia, $36 million. 
So, of the arrearages that are allegedly owed by the United States, they do not go to the operations of the United Nations. So when I see a headline like was held up earlier by the Senator from North Carolina which said we were undermining the United Nations by our failure to pay these arrearages, that is just poppycock. That is purely a statement of politics, not a statement of substance. 
The fact is that of the arrearages that are owed, should we end up paying them in full under our definition of what is `in full,' almost all that money is not going to stay at the United Nations; it is going to flow out to these other countries. 
I think the question has to be asked, What part have these other countries played in undertaking the burden of our activities, for example, in Iraq? Were they participants in the costs that we just incurred as a nation, which were dramatic, in Iraq? The present estimate of the Iraq costs, I think, is somewhere in the vicinity of $4.6 billion to our Defense Department in order to try to contain Saddam Hussein, and this 
was purely--purely--a U.N. initiative and effort. We were there flying under the flag of the United Nations, although our country obviously bore the biggest responsibility, because we are the most capable military power in the world. 
But to the extent we were there, we were picking up this ticketed cost of $4.6 billion to date, and it goes up every day. How much of that cost did these other nations, which are claiming that we are in arrears on peacekeeping and that they want us to pay them, pay for? How much of that cost? Well, France did not participate and has not participated in this most recent Iraqi buildup, to my knowledge. Italy did not participate. Belgium did not participate. The Netherlands did not participate. India did not participate. Pakistan did not participate. Russia did not participate. So, essentially, they are asking us to pay twice. They are saying first we have to pay these peacekeeping arrears to them, and then we have to go out and keep peace for them in Iraq. 
At some point, the American taxpayer starts to scratch his or her head and say, `Hold it. You know, this is our money. We recognize we have a responsibility to the United Nations, but don't try to make fools of us.' And that is the concern. The concern is that we are being asked to pay a disproportionate share of the burden of the peacekeeping activities of the United Nations today in Bosnia and in Iraq, and we are not getting any credit for it. 
To the credit of the Senator from North Carolina, he worked very hard to reach an agreement on how these arrearages should be managed as part of an overall reform package for the United Nations. A basic element of that reform package was that our peacekeeping responsibility would drop from 30 percent to 25 percent and that our dues for the operational aspects of the United Nations would drop from 25 percent down to, hopefully, 20 percent, at least 22 percent. 
We have not seen any action in that area, nor have we seen any action in the fundamental reforms which were alluded to, not specifically, but alluded to by the Senator from North Carolina as to the management of the United Nations, where American tax dollars are being used to hire the friend of a friend who happened to be the president of some country somewhere; an institution which is replete with duplication, bureaucracy, and, regrettably, in many instances pure old-fashioned patronage. 
American tax dollars are not being accounted for. They do not have a system of telling us where they spent the money. They do not have a personnel system that can tell us whom they hire, and they do not have a system which can tell us how their programs are being delivered and what the overhead of those programs is. So we asked for that as a condition for paying any further arrearages. None of this has been met. 
I come here with the same frustration as that of the Senator from North Carolina and, I think, the Senator from West Virginia as a cosponsor of this, and he is certainly a much more eloquent spokesman on issues like this than I am. But I, like many Americans, am saying, how can they continue to come to us and say, `Give us more,' when they are not giving us credit for what we have already done? 
The American taxpayer has a legitimate complaint here. The amendment of the Senator from North Carolina is a way to try to raise the visibility of that complaint. I congratulate him for it, and I hope we will adopt it. I yield the floor.  
Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I noted today that the President, speaking before his labor union leadership in Las Vegas, attacked the Republican budget and Members of the Republican Senate who voted for that budget, I being one, for underfunding his initiatives in education. 
I believe that deserves a response because it is a duplicitous statement, to be kind. Let's talk about what has actually happened here. The President sent us a budget. It was a budget which was supposed to follow the agreements which we had reached last year under the 5-year budget agreement which reaches a balanced budget. But because new funds have been identified, according to the President, as a result of the tobacco settlement, he decided to change that. 
Prior to sending us a budget, the President for days went out on the trail and proposed new program after new program after new program--140 I think is the number, $140 billion worth of new programs. Some of that was money on top of old programs, but the majority of it was on new programs, and all of it was outside the original budget agreement, and so he has sent us his budget which proposes all this new programming. 
Now, what did the members of the Republican Budget Committee do, and what did the Republican membership of this Senate do in passing the budget out of committee last night? We did two things. One, we said we reached an agreement last year so let's stick with that agreement. Let's continue to work towards balancing this budget. That happens to be a priority. 
In that context, we funded child care initiatives, new child care initiatives to the tune of $5 billion, bringing the total child care initiatives in this Congress being funded to somewhere in the vicinity of $74 billion. At the same time, we funded an expansion in NIH research activities, over $15 billion over the next 5 years, a huge expansion, a 40 percent increase in NIH funding. 
We also said that if there is a tobacco settlement, the proper place to put that money is in the Medicare accounts. Why? Because as we have learned, Medicare is the most threatened major Government program that we have today. We know that Medicare goes broke in the year 2005, 2007, somewhere in that range. It is essential that we fund that program so that senior citizens will have insurance. 
What is one of the main drivers of the cost of Medicare? Tobacco smoking. In fact, a recent study--I think it was done at Harvard--concluded that it cost $24 billion a year in Medicare costs in order to address the issue of tobacco. And so it is appropriate that any tobacco settlement money should go to the Medicare accounts. And that is what we decided to do. 
We also did something else, and this is on what I wanted to focus. We decided that the Congress should live up to its obligations in education to the special-needs children. Back in 1975, the Congress passed a law called the IDEA, 94-142, which said that children with special needs should have adequate education, and should be able to do it in the least restrictive environment. It was a good bill. It was an excellent law. As a result of that law, many children who had been shuttled off out of the local school systems, who had been put, unfortunately, in back rooms with teachers who had no experience and no skills to work with them, many children who simply because of their physical disability or their emotional problems were basically treated as pariahs within their school systems, were brought into the light and were given good educations. 
It has been an extremely successful undertaking. But at the time that we passed that law we said to local school districts, listen, we know this is going to be very expensive. We as a Congress know we are asking you to do something that is very expensive, so we as a Congress will pay 40 percent of the cost of the education of that special-needs child. 
Congress, acting as Congress unfortunately does so often, and 
the Presidency, acting also in concert, have not fulfilled their obligation to pay 40 percent. No. In fact, as of 2 years ago, the Federal share that was being paid was down to 6 percent of the cost of the education of the special-needs child. 
So what had happened in the school systems? In local school systems across this country, special-needs children and their parents were being pitted against the parents and children who did not have need for the resources of those special-needs children. 
What you had, I know very well, in school systems in New Hampshire was that over 20 percent of the local school dollars were going to support the special-needs child, and they still are. It was not unusual to cost $10,000 a year just for transportation of a special-needs child. Sometimes it would cost $30,000-$40,000 a year for the education of the child. And this was a situation where the special-needs child was not asking for something outrageous. They were asking for their rights under the law. 
Unfortunately, in asking for those rights, they were finding themselves pitted against the parents of the other children in the school system and the local taxpayers. 
Why was that? Well, because the Federal Government was not paying its fair share of the cost of that education. And the practical effect of that was that when the Federal Government failed to pay the 40 percent it was supposed to pay and was only paying 6 percent, the difference was having to be picked up at the local school district level. That meant that the money which the local school district may have wanted to spend on some other activity of education was being allocated to pay for the special-needs child. 
Now, what happened here was that the special-needs child was being unfairly and inappropriately put in a position of conflict with other children in the school system. The special-needs parents at school meetings across the country were finding themselves confronted by other parents who were upset that they did not have adequate resources because resources were going to assist the special-needs child. Why? Because the Federal Government was not paying its share of the burden of the special-needs child's education. Instead of paying the 40 percent which we said we would pay, we were down to 6 percent. 
So the Republican Senate, as the first act of taking control of this body, made the first bill which we put on the agenda a statement that we were going to try to put an end to this unfunded mandate activity, that we were going to try to right the situation, so that special-needs children would not be put in this intolerable position and their parents would not be put in this intolerable position, and so we would give relief to the local taxpayer, and so the Federal Government would live up to its obligations under the IDEA bill. That was S. 1. That was how high a priority we put on it here in the Senate as Republicans. We not only said it in the Senate and said it in the S. 1 bill--we did it. 
In the first year we controlled the legislative process in this body under the leadership of Senator Lott, with my support and the support of a lot of other people, we increased funding in the special-needs accounts, in the special-ed accounts, by $780 million. In the second year that we controlled the appropriating process, we increased funding in the special-ed accounts by $690 million. These were dramatic increases in those accounts, but nowhere near the increases that are necessary to reach the 40 percent. As a result of those initiatives, we now have funding for special education up to about 9.5 percent of the cost. It is a long way from 40 percent but a significant increase over the 6 percent where we started. 
That is a long explanation that gets to the point of what the President has said yesterday and why what he said is so disingenuous. How much money do you think this administration put into the special-education accounts in its budget that it sent up here? Remember, they put $12 billion into new education programs, new school construction, after-school programs, and more teachers for smaller classroom size. How much money of that $140 billion of new program and new initiative did they put into the special-needs program? the special-ed program? Mr. President, $35 million--not billion, $35 million. Essentially zero, when you look at it in the context of the overall budget requirements. They essentially said that, as a matter of policy, this administration does not care what happens in the special-needs account. It does not care what happens to the special-needs child. Rather, they would like to start new programs that will create new political sound bites, that will pay off new, different political constituencies that happen to support them. But as far as special-needs kids are concerned--zippo, for them. 
The practical effect of this is what is really insidious, because the $12 billion that they use to create new programs, new education programs, which basically pay off the teachers unions, gives them some sort of new initiative to talk about. Class size and building schools are two initiatives which the federal government actually has no role in, which have always been a local school responsibility. What more a local school responsibility and local school decision and discretion than what buildings a school has and how big their classes are? The administration took the two initiatives where there is no Federal role and they fund it with $12 billion. But in an area where there is a Federal role, where the Federal Government has said it has a 40 percent obligation, they put absolutely no money. 
How are they able to do this expansion of these education initiatives in the area of classroom size and in the area of building buildings? The way they were able to do it--and this is, as I mentioned, what is truly inappropriate about their proposal--the way they were able to do it was they essentially robbed the money from special-needs kids. If they had taken the $12 billion of new initiatives--which are political in nature, in my opinion--and put it into the special-needs program for the kids who need it, they would have come very close to reaching the 40 percent which would be the funding levels that the Federal Government had committed to relative to special needs. 
So they are essentially saying not only that they are not going to help special-education kids, but that they are going to take from special-education kids for the purpose of funding their initiatives instead of funding the special-education obligations which are already on the books. And the effect of doing this is as follows. Essentially, what they are saying is that we are going to create new categorical programs which require States and local school systems to do what we want them to do here in Washington. Essentially they are saying you, the local school district, in order to get the money which you are owed by the Federal Government, you are going to have to spend it the way we--somebody down at the Department of Education or somebody at the National Education Association labor union--want you to spend it. You are not going to be able to make that decision at the local level. You are going to have to do what we tell you that you have to do here in Washington. Had they, on the other hand, taken that money and put it into the special-needs program, put it towards the special-education student, then they would have freed up money at the local level. Then they would have given the local communities the flexibility to say how they wanted to spend their local dollars. But, by not giving the local communities those dollars for special education, by, rather, setting up these categorical programs, they ratchet down the Federal control of the local school systems. 
They are saying we are going to hit you with a double whammy, local school system. First, we are not going to fund your special-ed program so you have to take from your local tax base to do that, which doesn't allow you the flexibility to use your local taxes on the educational activities you want. If you want to build a building, you cannot do it under your own terms. If you want to add a science program, you cannot do it. If you want to add some sort of foreign language program, you cannot do it--because the dollars to do that are going to have to be spent to pay the Federal cost of special education. But if you want to get more money from the Federal Government, you have to do exactly what we want you to do in the area of class size and in the area of building buildings. It is, to say the least, a rather insidious approach to trying to take control over the local school systems. And it is a cynical approach, because the loser in this is the special-needs child, because the special-needs child is still left out there in the cold, to have to fight with the local school district in order to get the adequate funding to take care of his or her needs which should have been paid for by the Federal Government. 
I think I was just delivered a chart which maybe makes this point a little more precisely. Let me read it first. 
If you look at current funding for IDEA State grants, it is $3.8 billion. The funding that would bring the Federal Government to its promised 40 percent is $16 billion. The President's proposed funding for 5 years for educational programs which are not IDEA related is $12.34 billion. So, you can see fairly clearly from this chart what I have just pointed out, which is that if the President and his people were willing to fund the obligations of the special-needs children that are on the books instead of trying to create new programs which take more control over the local school systems, limits the flexibility of the local school systems, underfunds the special-needs children--if they were willing to live up to the obligation which they had made as a commitment under Federal law, funding 40 percent, a lot of the pressure would be taken off the local school systems and they would have the monies necessary to pay for special-needs kids and they would also have the flexibility to do whatever they wanted with the additional money that would be freed up from the local tax base. 
So we come back to this budget and the fact that the President claims that his education initiatives were not properly addressed and the Republican budget doesn't adequately address education. The Republican budget does not take the President's approach. We put $2.5 billion of additional money into the IDEA program. No, we 
do not fund all the new initiatives that the President wants because we believe we should fund the initiatives that are on the books first. We believe we should take the special-needs child out from under the cloud of the Federal Government not fulfilling its obligations, free up the local taxpayer and the local school board so it has the money to make the decisions that are needed to be made at the local level rather than have the Federal Government not fund the special-needs programs but create new categorical programs which try to take control over the local school system. 
So, the President, as I mentioned earlier, is at the least, to be kind, being disingenuous, inconsistent, and in this instance specifically not fulfilling the obligation of the Federal Government to the special-needs child. So I am perfectly happy, as we move forward on the debate on this budget, to put the Republican budget on education up against the Democratic budget on education--up against the President's proposals on education. 
I come to this floor as someone who headed up a school for special-needs children and who recognizes, on a personal level, how important it is that we give these kids full and adequate education. I come to this floor speaking on behalf of Republicans on the Budget Committee who say we will make our stand, we will be happy to make our stand on fulfilling our obligation to the special-needs child, and we will be happy to debate with any member of the minority party who wants to come forward with the President's proposal and claim that new initiatives--which will take more control over the local school systems, which are basically sops to various political groups who support them, and which do absolutely nothing to fulfill our obligation to the special-needs child--take priority, take priority over the law as it has already passed that said we would pay 40 percent of the cost of those children but, more important, over the fact that we have, for too long, left these kids in the lurch and put them in the intolerable position of having to compete for resources to which they, under the law, have a right. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to commend the United States Women's Ice Hockey Team for its outstanding gold medal achievement during the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. A proud America witnessed the outstanding teamwork and determination exhibited by the team in going undefeated and winning the gold medal in the inaugural women's Olympic ice hockey competition. New Hampshire is especially proud of three young women from our state who contributed to the success of the U.S. team: Tara Mounsey of Concord, Katie King of Salem, and Tricia Dunn of Derry. 
Just nine years ago, the U.S. women's ice hockey program did not even exist. Now, U.S. women's ice hockey is the best in the world, and the team's youngest player, Angela Ruggiero, is off to college with an Olympic gold medal and some memories to cherish for a lifetime. 
Leading up to Olympic competition, everyone knew Canada was the favorite, having a slight edge in winning seven of thirteen previous meetings between the U.S. and Canada. As the record shows, however, the United States was not far behind and was underrated by the international competition. 
A thrilling comeback in the first game of the round robin grabbed the nation's attention and showed that this team could overcome adversity and win against a powerful team from Canada, by scoring six goals in the last ten minutes to prevail 7-4. 
The team just didn't quit although they were down 4-1 with only ten minutes to play. Much like forward Katie King who refused to quit after she was rejected from the U.S. national team during sophomore year in college three years ago and much like defensive player Tara Mounsey, who refused to hang up her skates after she sprained her knee just two weeks before the Olympics. This team persevered and worked hard until it was successful. These young women represent America's commitment to hard work and self-sacrifice, and they inspired us with their performance both on and off the ice. 
After coming back to defeat Canada, the U.S. team's confidence swelled and they swept away the opposition, beating Japan twice, China 5-0, Sweden 7-1, Finland 4-2, and Canada 3-1 in the gold medal game. 
Team star Tara Mounsey has just celebrated her 20th birthday and her New Hampshire teammates Katie King and Tricia Dunn have all joined in the festivities surrounding their Olympic victory, including a celebration at the Statehouse in Concord. 
As a United States Senator from New Hampshire, I wanted to pay tribute to the U.S. Women's Ice Hockey Team and give special mention to three ladies from New Hampshire who made us so proud of them at the Olympics. 
I congratulate all of the members of the 1998 United States Women's Olympic Ice Hockey Team: Goaltenders Sara DeCosta and Sarah Tueting; Defensive players: Tara Mounsey, Angela Ruggiero, Colleen Coyne, Sue Merz, Vicki Movessian, and Chris Bailey; Forwards Lisa Brown-Miller, Karen Bye, Laurie Baker, Sandra Whyte, A.J. Mleczko, Jenny Schmidgall, Shelley Looney, Alana Blahoski, Katie King, Team Captain Cammi Granato, Gretchen Ulion, and Tricia Dunn; Head Coach Ben Smith, Assistant Coach Tom Mutch and Team Leader Amie Hilles. Ladies and coaches, we salute you and wish you well in your future endeavors.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the administration comes in for a fair amount of criticism from our side of the aisle, and I think most of it is well directed. So when they do something that is positive and which is, in my opinion, proper policy, it should also be acknowledged. 
The administration's decision today, the White House decision, the decision of the President, as presented by the President's people at Treasury, Deputy Secretary Summers, to put in place a moratorium, or send up legislation to put in place a moratorium on any tax relative to transactions over the Internet which States might try to assess is the absolute right decision. 
I know that the Governors of the different States were in Washington this week, and that they made one of their priorities the ability to assess a tax on transactions which occur over the Internet. That is wrong. The Internet is obviously the last Wild West of American and world entrepreneurship. It is an explosive technology of which, as we all know, we have only seen the tip of the iceberg. 
I can't think of any quicker way to retard that explosion of technology, creativity, entrepreneurship, and the prosperity which will arise from it, than to create a hodgepodge of taxation across this country assessed against the Internet by each State. I can't think of anything that would have a more chilling effect on the capacity of people using the Internet to participate in transactions involving commercial sales than if they were subjected to a tax policy which would vary from border to border, and probably within States from community to community. 
This would definitely undermine the condition in which the Internet has become one of the more effective ways that this Nation markets its products, not only within the United States but internationally. It would also undermine our capacity as a Nation to speak to other countries in this world which might be considering putting a tax on the Internet or Internet transactions, which would create a waterfall effect as other nations tried to join into it. It would be truly not only a bad example, it would end up being an incredibly bad policy for our Nation as a world leader in the area of technology. So the White House has chosen the right course here. 
I recognize that for years many of the Governors have sought the ability to tax interstate sales which occur through the mails. The Bellas Hess case has been the law of the land, which says that is not something that States can do and that the catalog companies that are based around the Nation, when they sell through the catalogs, are not subject in many instances to the sales taxes of the local States. I happen to think that is also the correct policy, but I recognize that many of the Governors do not. 
However, if they have a grievance with the issue that addresses the sales through catalogs, then that issue should be separated and settled independent of the Internet, and that issue should be settled first before we move into the Internet. They should not use taxation of transactions over the Internet as an attempt to leverage the issue of taxing catalog sales across the country, and that is basically what the goal of the Governors was here. They obviously cared about the Internet tax policy, but they were more interested in trying to get the catalog sale issue, which is a much bigger item right now--maybe not in the future, but right now--for these States. 
But in trying to do that, the Governors have, unfortunately--and speaking as a former Governor, I say that with genuine regret--pursued a policy which is wrong. Added taxes are not a good idea in most instances anyway, but added taxes which would be assessed across this country in all sorts of different varieties against the Internet transactions would undermine, as I mentioned, one of the great entrepreneurial issues, certainly in the latter half of this century and potentially as we go into the next century, for the beginning of the next century. 
I congratulate the White House for its decision to send up to the Congress a moratorium on any taxes which might be assessed by States against the Internet. I will strongly support that moratorium. I look forward to prompt action on it. 
I yield back my time and make a point of order a quorum is not present.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we as a nation are obviously wrestling with the issue of how to address the events presently occurring in the Middle East, specifically as they relate to Iraq. The Congress has considered taking up a resolution, which has been passed around and reviewed by many of us, but for a variety of reasons it does not appear that we are going to take such a resolution up during this week, and since we are adjourning, we will not be taking it up next week either. So I did want to make a few comments on this issue, because it is clearly the question of most significance that faces our country at this time. 
I do not believe that we can address the question of how we deal with a dictator such as Saddam Hussein in isolation. We have to look at the question in the context of the other nations which surround Iraq and in the context of the history which has led us to this point. This is especially true when we deal with Iraq--or any nation in that region of the world--because the history of that region is so convoluted and involves so many crosscurrents, it being, quite literally, the crossing point of thousands of years, of generations of individuals, of numerous cultures both East and West, Bagdad specifically being the center, for literally centuries, of commerce from the east to the west and from the north to the south. As a result, it was a place where many cultures merged. 
Therefore, when we as a nation, a new nation in the context of dealing with the Middle East, set ourselves down in the center of that part of the world, I think we have to be aware of the variety of forces which come to bear as a result of the historical events and prejudices and attitudes and cultures and religions that confront us there. I am not sure that we have been, really, in dealing with this issue. 
For example, let's begin at the outer reaches of the question from a territorial or geographic perception. Let's look at Russia. Clearly our capacity to deal with Iraq requires our capacity to encourage support amongst other nations for our position. We have had fairly limited success in that. In fact, you might almost call this administration's approach to alliance relative to Iraq as the English-speaking approach, because, as far as I can tell, it appears to be only English-speaking countries who are supporting this administration's present policies in an open manner. 
There are a few of the gulf states that have supported us, which is something we should not underestimate. But as a practical matter, I have noted with a great deal of sadness, actually, that the White House was taking great pride in the fact that yesterday it had been joined by Australia in support of its position. That's what they were heralding. We greatly appreciate Australia's support and admire them as a nation. But I think we also recognize that in the issue of the Middle East, it is not Australia that is important; it is nations such as Russia and our former Arab allies. I say former Arab allies because it appears that that is no longer the case--such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, who are critical, and Turkey. 
But in the area of Russia, for example, this administration appears to think that they can go to the Soviets--to Russia, 
my mistake--and demand that Russia follow our policies in Iraq and insist on their support on Iraq, but at the same time this administration proposes an expansion of NATO. You have to recognize, if you were a Russian leader, you would find a certain irony in a request that was coupled in that terminology. Because, of course, an expansion of NATO, especially to Poland, is an expression that can only be viewed in Russia with some concern and possibly viewed by some as an outright threat. 
NATO expansion is represented to us here in the United States as simply: Well, let's ask these three nice nations in Eastern Europe to join us in our alliance. But, of course, NATO is a security issue. It is an alliance made for the purposes of defending nations from threat, military threat. It is not an economic group, as everybody has noted for many years. As a practical matter, the capacity to expand NATO means that you are essentially saying to these nations that they are joining, for the purposes of their own national security, against some threat. What is the threat in Eastern Europe? Of course, the threat in Eastern Europe has always been either Russia or Germany. Since Germany is a member of NATO and is not a threat, clearly an expansion of NATO is addressing the threat from Russia. Therefore, when we ask Poland especially to join us in NATO, we are saying to Poland that we are giving you security against Russia, and clearly we are implying, certainly indirectly if not directly, that Russia may be the threat. 
So you can understand that Russia might view a push to expand NATO at the same time as we are asking them to support us in Iraq as being inconsistent and a bit ironic. And it reflects, unfortunately, I think, this administration's failure to understand the linkage--and linkage is the right term--between working with a nation like Russia and our capacity to do things in the Middle East and moving forward with the NATO expansion at the exact same time. Yet, if you were to listen to the leadership of this administration, they will tell you that there is no relationship, they have no overlap on those two issues. Of course that is not true, and that is one of the reasons we are having problems with Russia. 
It is equally a reason that we are having problems with our former Arab allies. Just yesterday or the day before yesterday--I lose track of the calendar here when we go to Egypt--but the Arab League met in Cairo, and they endorsed the French and Russian proposal, which was essentially a restatement, to a marginal degree, of the Iraqi proposal, as a league. The Arab League endorsed that as a league. Why would they do that? Because the Arab League essentially is dominated by Egypt, which has been our ally and which certainly, in many ways, is a friend of our Nation. I am a great admirer of the Egyptian people. They have certainly worked hard as a nation to try to bring about a constructive result, or progress in the Middle East in their relationship to Israel ever since President Sadat and through the present leadership in Egypt. 
You wonder why the Arab League would openly endorse the French and Russian program? Essentially, they do it because of the situation that presently exists in Israel and Palestine, the fact that the peace process is, for all intents and purposes, dead. Yet, if you were again to listen to this administration, as the Senator in the chair has pointed out in a number of conferences that we have had, this administration's attitude is that there is no relationship between the peace process in Israel and Palestine and the question of Iraq. Of course, there is. They are intimately related. In fact, if we were able to make progress or to get back on line the process of peace between Israel and Palestine, we would probably relieve dramatically the tension in that part of the world and it would inevitably lead to having support from Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the key allies, on the issue of how we address Iraq. 
So the failure of this administration to understand, again, the linkage between those two issues is a failure of fundamental proportions in their capacity to address the Iraq issue. 
The third area that this also reflects is the issue of Turkey. Turkey is not discussed a great deal in our Nation and it should be discussed more because Turkey is a unique and special nation in relationship to ourselves. Throughout the cold war, Turkey was essentially the front line. It was a nation which did not really ask for much, yet gave us its alliance and its assistance. We have truly, as a nation, and this administration, as an administration, has truly treated Turkey poorly. This goes to the issue of Cyprus and it goes to the issue of Greece. Yet if you were to ask this administration, what is the relationship between the Turkish-Greek issue and the Cyprus issue and the capacity to deal with Saddam Hussein, they would say that there is none, that there is no relationship there. That is maybe why they have abandoned the effort to bring to resolution that very critical issue of international importance. Yet we find today that Turkey, again, is hesitant to allow us to use its bases in order to address the Iraq issue. 
So, three major elements of the capacity to address the Iraq issue in a coordinated and effective way are tied to a variety of different historical and geographic and national and 
international confrontations, which this administration either, No. 1, doesn't appreciate or, No. 2, is actively ignoring. As a result, our capacity as a country to unite a coalition which can effectively address Saddam Hussein has been undermined. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes?

Mr. GREGG. Most critical, of course, to this is the issue of how we deal with Iran and the fact that, once again, this administration has failed to reflect effectively on the policy dealing with that nation. Iran, as we recognize, has been dominated by a fundamentalist leadership which has viewed its purpose as promoting an aggressive religious philosophy internationally. It has viewed the United States as its enemy in this undertaking. But this fundamentalism cannot survive forever. It is much like when we confronted the Communist leadership after World War II and President Truman and President Eisenhower recognized that, through the process of constructive containment, we would be able to bring down that system of government because it would fall of its own weight because at some point, after a certain period of years, the fundamental flaws of that system and that philosophy would simply undermine it and decay it from within. And that is true also of the fundamentalist movement in Iran. 
The Muslim religion is an extremely powerful and great religion, and it is a religion that is based on some very wonderful precepts. But the fundamentalism that captured a certain element of the Muslim believers is, as it is practiced in Iran, inherently self-destructive. If we are able to contain Iran but at the same time encourage within Iran the more moderate elements, we will, over a period of time, see, I believe, a collapse of the fundamentalist energy from within and a rising of a state which will be responsible. But this administration has passed over a series of opportunities to promote that option, which has been unfortunate. 
If you are going to contain Iraq, then you must understand that in the process of containing Iraq, you must neutralize Iran as a threat to the region. Because if you were to eliminate Iraq as a force within their region, you would create a vacuum into which a fundamentalist Iran would step and be a threat to its neighbors of even greater proportions--greater proportions--than Iraq is. So, reflecting adequately on how we deal with Iran, and approaching Iran as part of the solution to how we deal with Iraq, is critical, critical to the capacity to take on the Iraqi issue. Yet this administration, in my opinion, has once again left the ball on the side of the field when it comes to understanding or pursuing that course of action. 
So, where does that leave us? Unfortunately, where it leaves us is with a 19th century dictator who has 20th century weapons of mass destruction, in Saddam Hussein, an individual who lives by a code which is horrific to the sensibilities of a civilized world. It is a code that follows in the course of people like Adolph Hitler and Mussolini and others, who sought to promote themselves in the name of some cause which was really just superficial to their own megalomania. 
But our capacity to address Hussein and to be able to deal with the situation in Iraq is fundamentally undermined by our inability, one, to focus on the situation with an international alliance and, two, to have the capacity, because we do not have an international alliance, to take action which will end up being definitive. 
So we find ourselves with this administration stating that we are building up an arms capability to make an attack on Iraq without an alliance supporting it with a stated objective that nobody understands, because Secretary Cohen has said that a military attack will not replace Saddam Hussein, and the President said it is not our goal to replace Saddam Hussein. Secretary Cohen has stated that a military attack will not eliminate the weapons of mass destruction, and we know that to be the case. So what is the result of the military attack? 
There is no clear understanding as to what it is. It will not be that Saddam Hussein is replaced. It will not be that the weapons of mass destruction are eliminated. It will not be that the alliance we had in the gulf war of 1991 are being reinstated. I have no idea what the conclusion of a military attack would be. 
I think the unintended consequences of it will be dramatic. Some may be positive. We may successfully eliminate some weaponry that might otherwise be used against our neighbors. Some may be horrific. We may find that Saddam Hussein uses his weaponry in some other theater or some other place. It may even be here in the United States. But those are unintended consequences, because there appears to be no intended consequences. 
Literally, there are no intended consequences. If the intended consequence is not to replace him and the intended consequence is not to destroy the weapons, what is the intended consequence of military action? I don't know what it is. Therefore, before we go forward with a resolution in this body--and I understand that we are not going to do that this week--before we go forward with a resolution in this body, I believe we have to bring some definition to the purpose of the process. 
I believe, first, we have to recognize and we have to retouch our allies and our friends and people who should be our allies and our friends. We have to go back to Russia and understand their concerns. We have to go back to Turkey and understand their concerns. We have to go back to Egypt and understand their concerns. We have to go to Israel and talk about the need to get the peace process started again and to return to the concepts of Rabin as versus the concepts of Netanyahu. 
More important, we, as a nation, have to know what is our purpose and what is our goal. 
I believe our purpose and goal should be, first, to create a united approach on this to bring into the effort an alliance which is broader and more substantive than what we presently have, something more than an English-speaking alliance. 
Second, it must be to remove Saddam Hussein and his government. We should have as our stated goal and purpose of any military action that we intend to have a democratic government in Iraq. 
And, third, it should be that the weapons of mass destruction are destroyed; not that they will survive, but that they are destroyed. 
These should be our goals, and I hope as we move down the road to considering the issue of what we do in Iraq and before we move forward with military action that we at least get some clarity of the process, hopefully along the lines I stated. 
I appreciate the patience of the Chair, and I especially appreciate the patience of the Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California because I wish to address this issue, also. I, unfortunately, have a meeting that starts at 1 o'clock. 
Mr. President, I think we are all actually concerned about the issue of human cloning, and certainly the representations by the doctor from Chicago who stated he intends to pursue a course of commercializing human cloning has caused us to need to accelerate addressing this as a public policy matter. It is appropriately an issue that should be addressed at the level of the Congress of the United States. It should be spoken to by the people's representatives and not left to a regulatory environment such as the FDA for a determination, because it is a matter of dramatic import to our culture and to our scientific community. 
There is no question but that the concept of cloning a human is unethical, inappropriate and wrong. We don't have to delve very far into the history of this century to see the horror that can result from a society which allows itself to pursue a course of creating humans or designing a human race not based on God's will but based on the determination of a political decision or a scientific community. Obviously, the Nazi government, in its seeking of a master race, represents one of the true horrors of the history of mankind. 
So, the need to debate the issue of whether or not humans should be cloned I think is not necessary. There should be and I believe there is almost unanimity on the need not to allow human cloning to go forward in our society or any other civilized society. I think it is interesting to note that the European Community has also banned human cloning. The question becomes how should we proceed and whether we should proceed with a bill that has been designed by Senator Bond, Senator Frist and to some part myself, or whether we should proceed in some other manner. I for one strongly support the initiative that is put forward by the bill which we are presently considering because it addresses the core issue of human cloning, which is the creation of an embryo through the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer. That is really the question here. 
In order to clone a human, you produce an embryo and as a result you get a human if you follow the next scientific steps. 
What we have done is limited dramatically and really focused the question specifically on the necessary scientific acts to produce a cloned human and then said, `No, you cannot proceed in that direction.' That is the way it should be addressed. 
This bill was structured in order to respond to the very legitimate concerns of the scientific community for further research in all the areas the Senator from California has outlined. This bill does not, in my opinion, in any way limit the research into those areas because this bill is purely directed at the embryo issue and the creation of a cloned human being as a result of taking that step. The scientific issues are further protected by the commission which is in this bill, which says essentially that we have in place, or will have in place, a bioethical commission which will be able to evaluate science as it evolves and make a determination as to when science needs to have more leverage or needs to have more flexibility and then can come to the Congress and say what changes should occur in order to allow for that flexibility. So there is in place a commission which is not only scientifically based but is theologically based and which is politically based, in the sense that it represents, not politicians, but the community at large and which will have the capacity to review what is happening in the area of cloning technology so that we can stay ahead of the curve and be sure we are not limiting the scientific experience and expansion in this very critical area. 
So this bill allows for cloning in the area of agriculture and it allows for cloning in the area of animal husbandry. It also allows for cloning for the production of organs. It allows for cloning in stem cell research technology. It allows for cloning in a whole variety of places. Where it does not allow cloning is in the production of a human being, and that is what we should be saying. As a matter of ethics, as a matter of policy, as a matter of a nation which must stand up and define its purposes and ideas, we should be saying humans shall not be cloned. 
I yield my time.

 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Don Tibbetts, `Dean of the New Hampshire State House Press Corps' who recently retired after 24 years of news reporting on national and state politics for the Union Leader and the New Hampshire Sunday News. 
Don has witnessed many historical events over his career, from the thrill of the first in the nation presidential primary to the comings and goings of countless Governors. He has endured seemingly endless hearings and press conferences, yet has reported on each of them with style, substance, and integrity. 
In a state where people take their politics very seriously, Don was able to give the people of New Hampshire their daily diet of important facts about the events, votes, meetings, and rulings that impact their lives. What is remarkable about Don in this time of editorial journalism is the way Don gave his loyal readers the facts in an unbiased way and let them make their own judgments. 
In the State House, Don was constantly on the lookout for news, churning out several stories each day. His `Under the State House Dome' column was a must read for anyone who wanted to be informed about the latest yet to break news and information about politics in New Hampshire. 
Although Don is a lifelong member of the Fourth Estate, which often has a skeptical or even adversarial stance toward government officials, he always went the extra mile to listen to both sides of the story and reflect these views in his stories. 
The only time he did not play it down the middle was when he was on the golf course, where he has been known to hit an occasional errant shot. 
As someone who Don has covered for many years, I will miss him, and I know that his colleagues at the Union Leader and in the press corps will miss him too. The real questions is if Don will miss any of us. I wish both Don and Jane the best of luck in their future endeavors. 
Those of us in government will greatly miss his reputation as an honest broker of the facts, a perceptive historian and judge of people, and for helping to keep the job of governing enjoyable.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this evening we will hear from the President of the United States in his State of the Union Address. We live in a time where the United States is extraordinarily fortunate. We are at peace. We are a Nation that has great prosperity. We are a Nation with a balanced budget for the first time in 25 years. This is all good news. But there looms on the horizon a fiscal policy which, if we do not address in the coming near term, will dramatically undermine our Nation and make it difficult to pass on to our children a country of prosperity. That, of course, is the pending retirement, beginning in the latter part of the next decade, of the postwar baby-boom generation, that huge demographic group of which I and the President are members, which has impacted this country this very decade in some unique way, and which in the next two decades will, as a result of their retiring have an impact of basically bankrupting this country in the Social Security system, which so many seniors rely on, if we do not address these concerns. 
The opportunity to address these concerns is today. It is much like that oil filter ad, `You can pay me now or you can pay me later.' The opportunity to make changes in our Social Security system, which will allow for its solvency, allow it to be a strong and vibrant part of our fabric as a Nation, the opportunity for those changes to be effective and to be done reasonably, is much better today than if we wait for 4, 5 or 10 years. 
In addition, of course, as we head into a time of surplus, there will be, as a basic policy in this Chamber and in the House, over the next few months a question of how we use that surplus. What is generating the surplus should be the first question. What is generating the surplus is the Social Security trust fund. For the foreseeable future, the extent to which we generate a surplus at the Federal level will be as a result of the fact that more people are paying Social Security taxes than are taking benefits out of the Social Security trust fund. It is not a surplus generated, therefore, as a result of the day-to-day operation of Government being in surplus, of having raised more tax revenues for the day-to-day operation of the Government--defense, education, environmental protection, building roads, for those accounts income surplus; rather, it is a surplus generated by the fact that people who pay payroll taxes are paying more in payroll taxes to support people on retirement under Social Security than they need to. 
That should be retained as a primary point as we move down the road of addressing the surplus issue. Therefore, I would like to posture that if we are going to be responsible as legislators and as keepers of our Nation's future, we have an obligation to address the issue of Social Security and address it in the short-term, rather than to wait. I also would like to suggest a manner in which we might consider addressing it. One of our goals, as we look at the issue of the surplus, should be to give people tax relief. Another goal, as we look at the issue of the surplus, should be to pay down the Federal debt. A third goal, as we look at the issue of addressing how we are going to deal with the surplus, should be to increase the savings of the American people. A fourth goal should be to assure the solvency of the most critical Federal program that we have, the Social Security system. 
All four of those goals can be significantly advanced if we intelligently approach the use of the surplus and apply it to 
benefit the Social Security system. How can we do that? 
Well, the best way would be to cut the Social Security tax. This is the most regressive tax we have. It is also the taxes generating the surplus. If we were to reduce the Social Security tax so that the average wage earner, instead of paying approximately 7 1/2 percent, would end up paying 6 1/2 percent; it would mean that the average wage earner in this country would receive the benefits directly of a tax cut, the purpose of which would be to refund to them the surplus which is being generated by the Federal Government. 
In such a tax cut, if we were to say to the folks receiving it, the wage earners, the people paying the payroll tax, if we were to say that the tax cut must be saved in an account designated in your name, a personal savings account, such as an IRA account, then we would be accomplishing a second goal, which would be to allow individuals who are seeing retirement coming at them to begin to specifically have an account in the Social Security structure which would be in their name and on which they could participate in the investment decisions, and which would most likely return a much better return than the present Social Security system returns, and which would give them an actual savings vehicle. 
Thirdly, the practical effect of cutting the tax for people who are wage earners and allowing them to save would be that we would begin the process of refunding the liability in the Social Security system. The Social Security system today has a $3 trillion unfunded liability. So that as the postwar baby-boom generation hits the system in 2008, which is the first year when the system starts to pay more out than it takes in, there becomes a liability that must be paid for through either increased taxes or by reducing the benefit structure of approximately $3 trillion. Well, to the extent that we can encourage people to save by cutting their taxes today and putting those tax cuts into savings accounts, we can significantly reduce the unfunded liability of the Social Security system, which will, in turn, reduce the debt of the Federal Government, which would be another goal in using the surplus that we presently are confronting, or which we are soon to have. 
So it is great news that we have this surplus. After 25 years, it is extraordinary news. But the proper management of this surplus is clearly one of the core public policy questions that we have to face as a Congress. It is my view that the proper management of this surplus should involve returning to the taxpayers the funds that were paid in, which gave us the surplus, allowing us to give the taxpayers an opportunity to save for their retirement, and to assure the solvency of the Social Security system, and to begin to pay down the Federal debt. These are the goals that I believe we should be looking at. 
I am hopeful that the President, in his State of the Union Address, will set forth a process and a procedure for allowing us to reach these types of goals. So I look forward to hearing the President's proposals in his State of the Union, and I certainly look forward to the next few months as this Congress wrestles with the issue of how to preserve and protect the Social Security system at the same time that we address the budget surplus. 
Mr. President, I yield back my time.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes at this time to especially thank my staff, headed by Jim Morhard, and so many other members of the staff on both the Democratic and Republican side, who have spent literally hours, including all the hours of last night and many other evenings, but the entire night, getting this bill into a position where it could be passed. It is, as it appears to be, the last appropriations bill to be passed by the Senate and the House and, as such, it has had more than its fair share of issues attached to it. But as a result of the diligent and extraordinary work of the staff, both the Democratic and Republican staff, it is now, I believe, close to successful conclusion, and I anticipate that the House will soon be passing it, and it will be, as we have just agreed to here in the Senate, deemed passed. 
The bill itself is a very strong piece of legislation. It makes an extraordinarily aggressive commitment to supporting and expanding our efforts in the area of law enforcement, in the area of trying to stop the drugs that are flowing into this country, in protecting our borders and expanding our efforts to make sure that people who are convicted, especially of violent crimes, are incarcerated and kept in prison. 
It has a very strong commitment also to prevention activities in the area of our justice system. Special emphasis has been put on the violence-against-women initiatives, which are funded at $270.7 million in this bill, an increase of almost 55 percent in this category since I became chairman in 1995. 
Also, we have put a special emphasis on attempting to address the problems of the Internet relative to child pornography and, unfortunately, the fact that many pedophiles--people who wish to harm our children--are using the Internet for purposes of stalking children. We have continued, supported, and expanded the FBI's initiatives in things like `Innocent Images' which is a sting program to try to catch pedophiles and child pornographers. We expanded it so that local and State law enforcement communities will have experience in this area and can take advantage of the protocols set up by the FBI. 
Further, we recognize that juvenile crime is one of the greatest problems in the country today, and we have attempted to address that through the expansion of the juvenile justice programs, especially the preventive programs. I see Senator Coats here on the floor, who has been a force of immense energy in the area of trying to address juvenile prevention programs, such as Big Sister/Big Brother, and Boys and Girls Clubs, which is funded under this program. We have also created a new block grant, the purpose of which will be to help local communities in the area of juvenile justice. This block grant is aggressively funded with $250 million. 
There is, in addition, a comprehensive effort--it is a continuing effort--to address terrorism activities and to pursue an aggressive policy of counterterrorism. We all recognize, especially with the events of the last few days that have occurred in Pakistan, that Americans are at risk overseas. They are also, regrettably, at risk in our own country. We have seen two trials just recently completed, one involving the New York Trade Center, 
the other involving a shooting outside the CIA. Counterterrorism requires that we have a coordinated effort and that we have a strong law enforcement element in that coordinated effort, and this bill pursues both those activities. 
Senators who represent States along our border, our southern border especially, have found very serious problems in the area of drug enforcement and in the area of illegal immigrants coming across the border, so we are dramatically expanding the number of INS border patrols in this bill, increasing them by 1,000; including $250 million in new initiatives to try to restore the integrity of the naturalization process, which unfortunately has fallen on hard times, to say the least. That may not be the best description of it, in fact, because the system has so collapsed. This bill puts the dollars necessary to give adequate support to the INS, and also it dramatically expands the Border Patrol efforts so that States like, especially, Texas and Arizona, which need additional border patrols, will be able to obtain them. 
It significantly expands our efforts in the area of NOAA activities. This is one of our premier national treasures in the area of research and technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It is an organization which has cutting-edge knowledge in a variety of areas, but especially in the prediction of our weather. We aggressively pursue the expansion of our efforts in weather research and information areas. 
We give our judges a cost-of-living increase, something they deserve. This bill covers a lot of different jurisdictions, as is known by most of the Senators. One that doesn't get too much attention is the fact that it covers the judicial branch of our Government. We are going to try to help the Supreme Court out and renovate the Supreme Court building, but at the same time we are going to give our judges a reasonable cost-of-living adjustment. 
In the area of the State Department, we concentrate aggressively in trying to get their physical house in order. It is really a national disgrace, the type of equipment that some of our overseas personnel are asked to use. We still have dial phones in some embassies that we fund around the world. Many of our facilities are simply decrepit and rundown. We have made a major commitment to rehabilitate our facilities and to expand the communication and technology attributes of the State Department. 
In addition, we are making a major commitment to the personnel of the State Department. I believe they and their families deserve our support, especially in the area of giving them adequate security. We aggressively pursued that. 
Other agencies, the Small Business Administration, FCC, FTC, all of which are covered by this bill, are also aggressively addressed. We do all this in the context of a bill that, although it spends a considerable amount of money, over $31 billion, spends less than what the President requested and is clearly within the budget, which is a balanced budget, I would note, as a result of the budget passed by this Congress. 
So, again, I thank the staff for their extraordinary work in this area. I appreciate especially the assistance of the leader in allowing us to get this bill finally resolved. Without his intervention at a number of critical stages, it would not have been pulled together. I very much thank him for his assistance in this effort. 
I also especially want to thank my ranking member, Senator Hollings, who is really a great fellow to work with. He has a tremendous institutional history of how this committee works, and where the funding comes from, and what has happened in the past. His counsel has always been extraordinarily useful to me. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the appropriations for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related agencies for Fiscal Year 1998. The provisions came about through bi-partisan negotiations and provides $31.8 billion, an increase of $30.9 million above the House level, $135.3 million above the Senate level, and $297 million less than the President's request. 
Before getting to the details, I want to thank Senator Hollings, and his staff, Scott Gudes, Karen Swanson-Wolf, and Emelie East for all their hard work and dedication to getting this bill written and passed. Their efforts and expertise helped smooth the way for its success through the 99-0 vote in the Senate in July and its presentation to you today. 
The committee amendment includes many of the provisions that the Senate gave top priority to in its bill, but the funding levels reflect our negotiations with the House. Within the Justice Department, the committee amendment retains the Senate initiatives to fight crimes against children, increases assistance to state and local law enforcement, strengthens counterterrorism activities, bolsters drug control efforts, and provides funding for new juvenile programs. 
We have funded many programs that will further our efforts in preventing and combating crimes against children. The amendment provides $10 million in additional funding for the FBI's efforts to stop child exploitation on the Internet. In addition, we're making sure those organizations that work closely with the FBI also receive adequate funding to provide much needed support. There is $1.7 million for Missing Children; $6.9 million for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, of which $1.9 million is provided for Internet investigations; $1.2 million for the Jimmy Ryce Law Enforcement Training Center for State and local law enforcement investigations; and an additional $2.4 million for State and local law enforcement to form specialized units to investigate and prevent child exploitation on the Internet. These agencies have promising ideas of ways to improve current law enforcement procedures in this area to stop pedophiles from committing further atrocities. 
We believe it is the national interest to improve the skills of law enforcement personnel on all levels and supports initiatives to do this. The Community Oriented Policing Services, known as the COPS program, is funded at $1.4 billion. As part of this provision and with direct funding, we were able to preserve the Senate number of $25 million for the Regional Information Sharing System so that law enforcement officers throughout the country have increased access to national criminal databases. 
The Committee amendment includes an increase in funding for the Violence Against Women Act grants to $270.7 million. We recognize the need to enhance and expand current women's assistance programs as violent crimes against them continue. The Violence Against Women grants will be given to States to be used to develop and implement effective arrest and prosecution policies to prevent, identify, and respond to violent crimes against women. This funding provides domestically abused women and children with additional support services. Only 20 states received Violence Against Women grants in 1996. We believe there should be sufficient funding for more states to participate in these programs. Consequently, we have appropriated funds for this effort. 
In this amendment, we remain committed to ensuring that the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence community has a comprehensive strategy to combat domestic and international terrorism. In May Congress received from the Attorney General a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy compiled with consultation with other key departments and agencies. During subsequent 
oversight hearings, it became apparent that vulnerabilities to our national security still exist, especially to the emerging threats from chemical and biological agents and cyber attacks on computer systems within the United States. The hearings also emphasized the need for our efforts to be constantly coordinated among the many participating departments and agencies to make this very critical mission successful. To do this, the conference agreement provides $32.7 million for the Counterterrorism and Technology Crime Threat. 
We remain concerned about the proliferation of illegal drugs coming across our borders and its impact on our children. In an effort to support law enforcement efforts to combat the rampant spread of illegal drugs, the committee devotes $11 million through the DEA to combat the trade of methamphetamine and $10 million for efforts to reduce heroin trafficking. The COPS Program includes $34 million to stop methamphetamine production. We have created a new Carribean initiative that will disrupt the drug corridors and block the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. 
Over the last few years, the infrastructure needs of the organizations funded in this bill have been neglected. We have made a point of providing funds to repair buildings throughout our agencies. Over $300 million will go to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and Bureau of Prisons to make much needed infrastructure improvements. 
Regarding the INS, the agreement provides 1000 Border Patrol agents, over $200 million in new initiatives to restore the integrity of the naturalization process, and adds 1000 new beds for detention, and the ultimate deportation of criminal and illegal aliens. 
As a last mention within the Justice portion of the bill, we have increased funding to $238.6 million dollars for juvenile justice prevention programs with an additional $250 million for a new juvenile accountability block grant. 
In the area of the Commerce Department, we have made some difficult decisions, but, I think they are constructive ones. We have, for example, provided strong support for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which does high quality research and provides technical data important to our economy. The Sea Grant program, which conducts research of regional importance through colleges and universities, is strongly supported in this bill at a level of $56 million. 
The committee amendment provides increased funding for the National Weather Service. Many of us are concerned that the agency have the necessary resources to ensure timely warnings of severe weather, including tornados and hurricanes. 
There is $23.4 million for the U.S. Trade Representative taking into account the amended request made by the President recently. 
The Bureau of Export Administration has two new requirements which deserve mention. First, the Department of State's encryption export control responsibilities have been transferred to the Export Administration. Second, with the ratification of the Chemical 
Weapons Convention, the Export Administration will have primary responsibility for enforcing the convention and is thus provided with $1.9 million to do this. 
And I've kept the best for last--well, at least the issue that seems to have the most interest of late--The Census compromise achieved by the White House and the House leadership--it has two parts. First, it establishes a commission to oversee the Census and report regularly on the conduct of the Census. Second, it establishes fast track procedures for judicial review of sampling. 
In the Judiciary portion of the bill, we have had to confront some difficult issues, but, I believe we are providing the American people with a better Judiciary through our efforts. The appropriation is sufficient to maintain current judicial operation levels and takes into account the increase in bankruptcy caseloads and probation population. We are also providing the Justices and judges with the 2.8 percent cost of living adjustment requested in the President's budget. 
We have established a commission to study the current structure of the circuit courts, especially the controversial Ninth Circuit. During the 1996-1997 session, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned 96 percent of the decisions they reviewed from the Ninth Circuit. This high turnover rate is a beacon that the Ninth Circuit is not meeting the needs of the people it serves. The debate over whether to split it has raged for some years. The commission should end the debate over the Ninth Circuit once and for all. 
Moving on to the State Department, we have fully funded, to the best of our ability, the operations carried out by this Department. We made sure that the day-to-day functions of the State Department are funded at acceptable levels, and we are trying to upgrade their outdated technology systems. Maintaining infrastructure was a top priority for the Senate this year. We are providing $21.4 million above the President's request for the Capital Investment Fund so that desperately needed upgrades in information and communication systems can be done. 
And as a final noteworthy item, this bill covers the first down payment for U.N. arrears as well as the State Department Reauthorization bill which includes U.N. reform and State Department reorganization, which we have worked so hard to achieve. 
That is a quick run down of the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary provisions before us. I want to thank my staff--Jim Morhard, Kevin Linskey, Paddy Link, Carl Truscott, Dana Quam, Vas Alexopoulos, and Luke Nachbar--for all their hard work. They, and their democratic counterparts, have spent long hours drafting this legislation. I believe this amendment contains sound provisions that have been agreed to by both parties. The departments and agencies funded in this legislation can only benefit from the passage of these new funding levels. I urge all of my colleagues to support the passage of this committee amendment. 
Just to quickly comment on that section of the bill, the language which is in this bill dealing with the funding for State, Commerce, Justice, is similar to the language which passed this Senate by a 99-0 vote. The language which is before the Senate at this time is language which has been agreed to by the Democratic and Republican members of the Appropriations Committee unanimously. Again, I strongly encourage the Senate to pass it. 
At this time, I yield back the time allocated to myself and Senator Hollings under the bill.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue which has far-reaching concerns for our Nation. Many of our colleagues have heard of the improving economy and have participated in the improving economy and recognize as a result of this improving economy it is likely that the Federal Government will incur a budget surplus in the very near future. This comes about because of a lot of hard work by this Congress, especially this Republican Congress, in controlling the rate of growth of the Federal Government. It is something that is unusual, obviously, not having occurred in the last 25 years. 
Not only will we have a budget surplus, but it is projected by OMB that the budget surplus will continue well into the first decade of the next century. 
So, I think that we need to discuss how we address this issue. This is an unfamiliar situation, as I mentioned, for Washington. We certainly do not have much experience in dealing with surpluses so there is naturally some perplexity as to how best to address it. To my mind the answer is pretty clear: The surplus should result in relief to the American taxpayers. 
Needless to say this is the right answer on economic grounds. If the Government takes in more revenue than it needs to finance its operation, the answer is not for the Government to spend that; rather, it only makes economic sense to return the extra revenues to the private economy that bears the burden of supporting the Government. Not only that, but in this particular case, the appropriateness of tax relief could not be more clear. Let none of us forget what has enabled Congress to accomplish this goal of balancing the budget. It has in large part been the dramatic growth of the economy. 
If the private sector in this country had not come through with a surge of productivity, then the budget negotiators might not have been able to reach the agreements necessary to accomplish a surplus to reach a balanced budget. 
It would, therefore, be ungracious of us, at the least, not to return that surplus to the taxpayers who have earned it. 
I rise, Mr. President, today to voice a specific hope--that this Congress will consider, when that time comes, when we have reached a surplus, including a cut in the payroll tax as the appropriate way to address the returning of this surplus to the American taxpayer. 
There are several reasons for this--all of them, I believe, noble. First of all, the payroll tax is the most regressive component of our tax burden. There are no deductions, no personal exemptions in figuring of the payroll tax. It's assessed directly on the first dollar of workers' wages, and from there it goes upward until it reaches the wage cap. 
Moreover, the payroll tax has been the fastest growing component of the Federal tax burden. When one includes the employer's share of this tax, we find that the majority of Americans pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes. The payroll tax has grown dramatically from a level of approximately 1 percent for each employee and employer a little more than a generation ago, to today where it is approximately 15.3 percent. So while Federal revenues have stayed roughly constant as a percentage of the National economy, an ever-larger proportion of the burden of taxes has been carried by the wage earner in the form of payroll taxes. 
But an equally important point is that these payroll taxes were never intended to finance the general operations of Government, as it is doing today. Quite the contrary. The payroll taxes are supposed to finance the operations of the Social Security system and the Medicare system. 
I know my colleagues do not need to be reminded of the enormous unfunded liability that exists with respect to the long-term obligations of the Social Security and Medicare systems. These enormous payroll tax burdens, I regret to say, are not being used to reduce that long-term liability. Surplus payroll taxes today are used to buy Government securities, which must be redeemed by the Federal Government in the future to pay back Social Security programs. That money will, of necessity, come from taxation again, to create the general revenues necessary to redeem the bonds. 
A review of the figures is startling. Right now, Social Security's total income is $451.3 billion and total outflow is $370.8 billion. This leaves a surplus in the Social Security funneled of $80 billion. Of that total, $43.6 billion is in the form of interest payments by the Federal Government to itself, and the other $36.9 billion represents the annual operating surplus in the Social Security trust fund. 
So each year, we run an annual operating surplus in Social Security that is slightly more than 1 percent of the national payroll. That surplus is combined with interest payments to increase the size of the Social Security trust fund. That trust fund is projected by the trustees to grow each year until it reaches a peak value of $2.89 trillion in the year 2019. 
I ask my colleagues to think about what that $2.89 trillion means. That $2.89 trillion is not only assets owned by Social Security; more importantly, it is a debt owed by the Federal Government to Social Security. In order to pay the benefits to future beneficiaries, the Federal Government will need to tax the American public, through general tax revenues, to come up with this $2.89 trillion. 
Every year that we collect these surplus payroll taxes, we create several significant events. We add to the trust funds, and thus we add to the debt owed by the Federal Government. We take payroll taxes from hard-working Americans today and, instead of really saving them, we convert them into a tax burden on the Americans of tomorrow. This certainly is no way to run a government, a country--or a railroad, for that matter. 
In order to fully understand the bizarre situation in which we are placing ourselves, I ask my colleagues to consider the trustees' projections for the period 2012 through 2019. In the year 2012, we will see the first year of operating deficits within the Social Security trust fund. That means that, in that year, annual Social Security revenues will amount to less than promised benefits. 
In other words, it will require cash from the general Treasury in that year just to meet the current benefit payments to Social Security recipients. 
Yet, in that same year, interest compiled by the Social Security trust fund will be an enormous $140 billion. So we will need to take $9 billion of that interest payment from the general fund and use it to pay beneficiaries immediately. The other $131 billion will be credited to the Social Security trust fund, so that the trust fund will grow, theoretically at least, from $2.2 to $2.4 trillion in that year, even as the program is running annual operating deficits. This obviously doesn't work. 
Think about what will be happening at the same time. We will need money from the general Treasury just to pay current beneficiaries, and billions in assets will be added to the Social Security trust fund--but that doesn't exist--and the 
trust fund, continuing to grow, will earn even more interest in the next year, to be paid from the general Treasury. 
So each year--from 2012 through 2019--the Federal Government will make larger and larger contributions to Social Security, in current benefit payments and interest payments. In the year 2018, for example, the Social Security operating deficit will be $147 billion. That means it will have to pay out $147 billion more than it takes in. So, of the $171 billion in interest payments that will be due that year from the Federal Government, $147 billion will be needed right away to pay benefits, and only the remaining $24 billion will continue to build the trust fund. 
It's in the year 2019, however, that the roof really starts to fall in. Then, even with all the interest payments from the general Treasury and all the current payroll taxes and benefit taxation, there will still not be enough money to pay the Social Security beneficiaries, and we will have to begin to redeem the principal on Social Security trust fund T-bills in order to pay the benefits. 
Every year that we continue to collect surplus payroll taxes, and thus swell the size of the trust fund, is a year that we add to the unfunded liabilities that we are piling on the heads of our children and their children, the American taxpayers to come. 
It is largely for this reason that I believe that payroll tax relief is needed. I have introduced a piece of legislation, S. 321, that would give 1 percent of the payroll tax back to the wage earners; in other words, it would be a tax cut, to be saved in an individually owned retirement account. This would give us a Head Start on prefunding some of the massive liability, by moving it off the Government ledger and into genuine savings, because, you see, the basic problem here is that the Social Security system is a pay-as-you-go system. That creates a huge unfunded liability. Until we start to prefund that liability, we are not going to get out from underneath that unfunded liability. The best way to prefund that liability is to take the surplus that we are presently running in the Social Security system, cut taxes, give wage earners back their money, and allow them to save it for their retirement so that they have a savings account, identified to them, in their name, which they can use to benefit them at retirement and, thus, turn a contingent liability into an actual savings vehicle. 
If we were to pass this bill today, S. 321, we would not solve all of Social Security's problems, but it would eliminate approximately 78 percent of Social Security's projected insolvency. That is a pretty good chunk. We would, however, vastly reduce the burden on tomorrow's economy. For example, whereas, under present law, Social Security will absorb more than 17 percent of the national payroll tax base by the year 2030, under this legislation, it would absorb closer to 14 percent. That is a major drop--3 percent--in our national economy, which will at that time be multiple trillions. That is part of the gain that comes from prefunding Social Security's liability, instead of simply continuing to collect and spend surplus payroll taxes, leaving tomorrow's obligations for another day. 
It is critical, as we debate the issue of the surplus which is coming, that we make a thoughtful decision on how to handle it. I think a thoughtful decision involves some obvious facts. What is our most significant, looming fiscal problem as a nation? It is the burden of our pension plans, which are unfunded. What is the most significant unfunded pension plan in America? It is the Social Security system. 
The second logical effort that should be addressed in addressing the surplus is, who gave us the money in the first place? Who has the best right to claim that money? That is clearly the taxpayers of America. We can address both of these issues by following the course that I have outlined here today--cut the Social Security tax, return it to the wage earner, allow the wage earner to start to preinvest, to presave for their retirement, with the taxes which are now going into a fund that is on a cash-flow basis. The taxes are now being used to operate the Government, the general Government, instead of being used and identified as the savings of the Social Security recipients. This is a good policy approach to what is looming as one of the major policy debates that we will confront as a Congress as we move toward the next century. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately proceed to executive session for consideration of Calendar No. 324, the nomination of Charles Siragusa of New York to be a U.S. district judge.

At the expiration or yielding back of time, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the Siragusa nomination. Therefore, Senators should be alerted that there will be a rollcall vote this morning at 10:30 a.m. 
Following the vote, there will be a period of morning business until 12 noon. At 12 noon the Senate will begin consideration of S. 1292, a bill disapproving the cancellations transmitted by the President on October 6. While that measure has a 10-hour statutory time limitation, it is the hope of the majority leader that much of that time may be yielded back. 
The Senate may also consider and complete action on any or all of the following items during today's session: The D.C. appropriations bill, the FDA reform conference report, the Amtrak strike resolution, the intelligence authorization conference report, and any additional legislative or executive items that can be cleared. 
I also remind all Senators that under rule XXII, they have until 1 p.m. today in order to file timely amendments to H.R. 2646, the A-plus educational savings account bill. Needless to say, all Senators should expect rollcall votes throughout today's session of the Senate. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution for myself and the two Senators from Virginia, honoring emergency medical services [EMS] personnel across the country. I was asked by Martin Singer, chief of the bureau of emergency medical services in New Hampshire, to submit this resolution, recognizing this important annual event. I am pleased to be joined by my two colleagues from Virginia, Mr. Warner and Mr. Robb, as original cosponsors. 
In 1993, the Virginia Association of Volunteer Rescue Squads, Inc., and the Stanley Wise Foundation organized the first annual National Emergency Medical Services Memorial Service in Roanoke, VA. As the first State in the Nation to have a volunteer rescue squad, Virginia has taken the lead in recognizing the importance of these members of our communities both through the establishment of a museum devoted to EMS personnel called To The Rescue and now a memorial service to honor those EMS personnel who have died in the line of duty. They have opened their doors to communities across the Nation giving them the opportunity to honor these selfless individuals. It is time now that we, as a Nation, recognize Virginia's efforts and let EMS personnel across the country know that we appreciate their efforts and honor those who have given their lives to save the lives of others with this national memorial service. 
The memorial service which has been held in Virginia annually for 5 years has now honored 119 EMS personnel from 35 States. My own State of New Hampshire has had three providers who had served our State honored for their extraordinary service. Most recently, in the ceremony held on May 24, 1997, Mr. Lawrence A. Volz of Newington, NH was honored. Mr. Volz lost his life in 1971 at age 48 while driving a community ambulance. This memorial service lets the family and friends of these very important people know that the ultimate sacrifice made by their loved ones for their fellow man is recognized and honored. 
It is my hope that the introduction of this resolution will make this very special service more widely recognized by the country as a whole to let all EMS personnel know that their dedication and contributions to their communities are greatly appreciated.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period for morning business until 12:30 p.m. At 12:30 p.m., the Senate will recess for the policy luncheons to meet until 2:15 p.m. When the Senate reconvenes at 2:15 p.m., the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the paycheck protection amendment currently pending to S. 25, the campaign finance reform bill. If cloture is not invoked on the amendment, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the campaign finance reform bill itself. If cloture is not invoked on the bill, the Senate could resume the D.C. appropriations bill for the consideration of the remaining issues to that appropriations matter. A cloture vote is scheduled for tomorrow on the pending Mack-Graham amendment to the District of Columbia appropriations bill if that issue is not resolved. 
Also, as announced, the Senate may turn to any appropriations conference reports that become available. Therefore, additional votes will occur following the 2:15 p.m. vote during today's session of the Senate. I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. I wish to join with others in stating my admiration for the chairman's efforts here in getting this bill forward. He understates his role if he thinks somebody has worked harder than he. He is clearly the person who has put the most time in this and developed an excellent bill. 
That is the point. The bill reported out of the committee came out of the committee with a huge vote, 14-4, a very definitive statement by the committee which has a fair number of experts, one of whom you just heard, Senator Mikulski from Maryland, on various parts of this bill, a fair number of experts who understand the importance of bringing the FDA into the 21st century. 
Why is it important? I think the statement has been made over and over again here in the last few days, but I think it needs to be made again. The fact is this involves people's lives. We have spent a lot of time on this bill and we have had a lot of votes on this bill. We had an 89-5 cloture vote on September 5; a 94-4 cloture vote on September 17; and yesterday, a 98-2 vote in favor of the bill. At some point, people should be willing to say enough is enough. It was inappropriate to delay this bill as much as it has been delayed. 
This is about people's lives. The capacity to get these drugs out, to get these devices out, to give people the ability to use these various pharmaceutical treatments and various device treatments which are in many instances going to save lives and in almost all instances going to improve lives, is critical. 
I have a situation in New Hampshire. An attorney named John Hanson wrote to me about a friend of his who, regrettably, has ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease. This is a horrible disease. It is a disease that eats away at your capacity as an individual to function. Although your mind stays sharp, the rest of your body fails. Every day that goes by is a critical day to this individual, every day that goes by. 
Now, the FDA had a product before it called myotropin which is waiting for approval. The people who have ALS are very interested in getting this drug, but they can't get it because the FDA has taken the position that it is not yet available on the market. 
Why is that? It is because of this long lead time of bureaucratic activity that is the wrap-up period for the approval of drugs. Regrettably, as a result of that long lead time, which can be years and years and years, many people are unable to get these drugs which are so important to them. In a case like ALS, of 
course, it really is the individual who should have some option in being able to choose whether or not to use a drug. That individual has a pretty stark choice before them--die as a result of the disease you have; or maybe have a chance of surviving as a result of taking a drug which maybe has not had years of review but has only had a few years of review. 
So the issue is how do we get the FDA to approve these drugs, approve these devices in a prompter manner, in a manner which doesn't give up any of the need for making sure that the drugs are safe and that they work, making sure that the devices are safe and that they work, but does give up the bureaucracy which has for so long and so often stifled a prompt review process. 
So this bill which the Senator from Vermont has brought forward today really does attempt to overcome what you might call the culture of overcautiousness which has become, regrettably, the culture of the FDA. It is an attempt to say to the FDA in a very definitive way, listen, we understand the importance of what you do, we understand that you are sincere and committed individuals. But we also understand there is another part of this formula that is called getting the drugs to the patients, getting the devices to the patients. 
So, let's start working as a team to get these things out quickly. To accomplish that, a number of proposals were put forward to make the FDA work more effectively and make the drugs and devices which are distributed across this country more understandable in their usage and also more readily available when they work. 
We have heard a lot of discussion, of course, about section 404. I note that the Senator from Massachusetts has another group of lists up there on section 404 of people involved in this issue. One thing that has been mentioned is that this new section 404 may in some way be tied into the fen/phen issue. Well, it is not. Section 404 is a device section. It is not a drug section and does not apply to drugs or drug manufacturers. Using that as an example, which just recently occurred, is truly a red herring. The purpose of section 404 obviously is to try and get these devices out in a more prompt and efficient manner. 
Now this language was put together after a lot of work and a lot of negotiation, a lot of discussion, with all the different parties involved. I know the Senator from Vermont was actively involved, the Senator from Indiana was aggressively involved. My sense is that everybody who had a legitimate concern about section 404 had a fair hearing before the committee, and the committee decided that the compromise language which was put in the bill--and believe me, it was compromise language--on section 404 was the most effective and appropriate way to go. The committee decided it by a 14-4 vote. 
I hope this Congress and this Senate specifically would give considerable respect to the efforts that were made at the committee level on this specific issue. I do think in this instance the Senator from Massachusetts is just plain wrong. His position is not consistent, in my opinion, because he has brought in debate over drugs with the medical device issue, but more importantly, it is not the position which was adopted by a vast majority of the members of the committee, because we understood the importance as a majority in the committee, 14 people who voted for this, of getting out some major reform in the FDA laws which would allow for a prompter approval process without giving up any of the issues of safety or effectiveness of the drugs or the devices that are being involved here. 
I congratulate the Senator from Vermont again for moving forward. It appears we may actually be getting to the end of the day on this bill relative to passage. I hope we would not see any more of this delay tactic as we move down the road because every day that gets delayed potentially costs a life, and certainly causes people who need these drugs, need these devices, a tremendous amount of anxiety on top of a situation which in almost every instance is already filled with extraordinary anxiety because of the type of disease or problem they have. 
So let's get on with doing the business of the Senate and pass this bill.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand we are in the middle of debate on FDA which has been going on for some days. I did want to talk briefly about the President's comments in New York yesterday relative to the United Nations. 
The President went to the U.N. General Assembly and made a very eloquent speech, as he often does, in which he promised that he would be paying what is represented to be the arrears of the people of the United States that we owe to the United Nations, arrears which is somewhere around $1 billion. I think that was generous of the President to do that. But he should have made it much clearer what the conditions are for our paying those arrearages. 
As chairman of the committee that has the authority over the spending of the money relative to the U.N. accounts, I have been working with Senator Helms and Senator Grams, along with the administration and with House Members, and we have developed a package which makes that payment to the United Nations conditioned. Unfortunately, the way the President expressed it, the conditions were mentioned only in passing, and hardly even mentioned at that. But the conditions are critical. 
The American people simply are not going to send another $1 billion to the United Nations unless the United Nations cleans up its act--unless they reduce the patronage; unless they put in place accounting procedures that are trackable--so that we when we send $1 there we know where it goes. 
Today the American citizens pay 25 cents of every $1 spent at the United Nations and the United Nations has no idea where that money is spent. Not only do they have no idea where most of that money is spent--they may have an idea but they certainly don't know specifically where it goes--but, more importantly than that, they don't have any systems in place to assess whether or not the money is getting anything for the dollars that are being spent. 
What we are seeing is an institution which is rampant with mismanagement and inefficiencies. Regrettably, the President didn't point that out. He had an excellent opportunity to stand before that body and say, `Listen, if you expect the American taxpayers to pay for a quarter of the cost of this institution then the American taxpayers expect adequate accounting. And the American taxpayers expect that it will be spent on programs that work. And the American taxpayers do not want to have their money spent on patronage. And they don't want to have it mismanaged, and do not want to have it inefficiently used.' 
The new Secretary General of the United Nations has given a significant number of talks on this topic. He has pushed forward an agenda for reform. But his agenda for reform doesn't go as far as the agreed to package, which passed out of this Senate with an overwhelming vote. 
The simple fact is that I have come to the floor today to restate the obvious, which is that we are not going to send $1 billion to the United Nations until the conditions of that package are met, until we know that the dollars are being spent effectively, and until we know that there is in place a reform effort which is going to work. 
I regret that the President did not take the opportunity to express that thought to the membership of the United Nations. But I think the point should be clarified before the people who are expecting to get their billion dollars think they have a blank check, because they don't. We are not going to tolerate it. 
I yield the time.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wanted to speak briefly on the amendment that has been offered. I recognize the Senator from Washington has raised the issue of constitutionality on this amendment. I leave that to constitutional attorneys in this body--of which he happens to be a leading one--to debate and discuss. 
Let me mention quickly some of my concerns to the opposition of the underlying amendment. I believe the Senator from Arkansas has brought forward an appropriate amendment. What we are talking about here is essentially corporate welfare. This is not about family, and whose families does this or that, quite honestly. As a practical matter I believe the majority of the mining companies involved here, or a large percentage, come from other countries. We are talking about families. It would be how we benefit families from different countries. It is a classic case of corporate welfare. 
The Senator from Arkansas has outlined in great detail, and very appropriately, what appears to a considerable outrage being perpetrated on the taxpayers of America in that we are selling land at $2.50 an acre which generates billions of dollars worth of revenue to corporations who pay virtually nothing in relationship to that revenue as it relates to the ore brought out of that land. In fact, the irony is they get a depletion allowance, a depletion tax allowance on the basis of this $2.50 land--not using that as a basis--which shouldn't apply to them to begin with because the land isn't purchased at a fair value. Yet they are given a tax break, a depletion allowance, in order to subsidize what is already grossly subsidized. 
It is appropriate as we step forward, as the Senator from Arkansas has, and say if you are going to make this type of money off lands which are publicly owned--and the land is not publicly owned by the State, it is publicly owned by the Federal Government, and the Federal Government is the people of this country, not just the people of one State--if you are going to make money off publicly owned lands, the public should get some sort of return on it. That is only reasonable. The public should have the right to expect that it would benefit from the extraction of these valuable ores from land which they own, much as anybody who was a stockholder in a company would benefit from the profits of a company. The taxpayer is essentially the stockholder. The land is owned by the taxpayer. Therefore, there is a legitimacy to the position taken by the Senator from Arkansas that the value that is being withdrawn from this land should be returned in part, at least, to the people whose land is being used. 
If you own a farm and you discover there is oil under your land, as a private citizen, and you go to an oil company and say, `Come on to my farm and pump my oil out,' you are not going to say, `I will sell you my land for $2.50,' would you? Nobody would, no. You will say, `Come on to my land, I may lease it to you for $2.50'--I find that hard to believe for the purposes of pumping oil, 
`but when you pump that oil out I will want a percentage of that profit.' It is called a royalty payment. That is what is being proposed by the Senator from Arkansas. 
It is totally reasonable in light of the staggering, staggering wealth which is generated from these mining claims in exchange for the minute amount of money that is paid for these mining claims. Estimates that have been pointed out by the Senator from Arkansas: For as little as $1,500, people purchased mining claims that generated over $3 billion; for as little as $275, people purchased mining claims worth over $1 billion; for as little as $9,000 people generated mining claims worth over $11 billion; and we have pending one where people will pay about $10,000 for benefits of approximately $38 billion. 
How can anybody in good conscience go back to their taxpayers and say we just sold a piece of your land that has $38 billion worth of assets on it; we just sold it for 10,000 bucks? Who would go to their neighbor, with a straight face, and say `They just found oil on my land. I just sold it to the oil companies for $10,000. The oil is worth $38 billion. Didn't I get a good deal, neighbor?' You would be laughed out of town. 
I think people who have the responsibility, the fiduciary responsibility of protecting the taxpayer and the taxpayers' land might also be laughed out of town, or at least be voted out of town if they continue to pursue this course. 
I strongly support the underlying amendment. I will leave it to the constitutional lawyers to settle the constitutional point. But the concept of giving the taxpayers a fair break on this issue, the concept of giving the taxpayers a decent return on this very valuable asset is, I think, very appropriate, and it is time we started putting an end to this kind of corporate welfare. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to rise in support of the bill which has been brought forth by the Senator from Washington. I think he has done an extraordinary job in developing this appropriations language in this bill relative to the Interior and various departments which the Interior impacts. I especially want to thank him for his sensitivity relative to the Northeast. 
There is a different view in this country between the Northeast and the West on a number of issues that involve land conservation and the question especially of protecting lands, public lands. In the Northeast, especially in northern New England, we are still struggling with the fact that we would like to protect some additional lands. We have a spectacular place called the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire, and it is the most visited national forest in the country. In fact, it receives more visitors per year than Yellowstone, which is a national park. It is under tremendous pressures from popular use because it is so close to the megalopolis of New York, Boston, and Washington. 
It is an extraordinary place, but to maintain it and to maintain its character, it requires that we continue to address some of the inholding issues around the national forest, and the Senator from the West has been sensitive to the Senators from the East on this point. I thank very much the Senator from Washington for his sensitivity in allowing us to go forward in this bill and complete the purchase of a very critical piece of land called Lake Tarleton in New Hampshire. 
In addition, he has assisted us in a number of other areas in this bill, and I thank him for it. 
I also want to talk about a position that has been brought forward in this bill relative to the National Endowment for the Arts, because I think the Senator from Washington has reached the appropriate balance in the language which he has put in this bill relative to the National Endowment for the Arts. 
The National Endowment for the Arts, as we all know, has been a lightning rod of controversy, especially on the House side, less so on our side of the aisle, because of some of the things that the Endowment over the years has funded, which have been mistakes, to say the least. 
But the fact is that there is a role, in my opinion, it is a limited role, but there is a role for the Federal Government and for State governments in the area of assisting the arts in this country. 
Arts are an expression of the culture of a country or a nation, an expression of the attitude, personality, and the strength of a nation. The ability to have a vibrant arts community in a nation is critical, I believe, to the good health and the good education of a nation. 
The Federal role, in participating in this, should be one of an incubator. The Federal role should be one as the starter of the initiatives. And the dollars which are put in this bill for the purposes of assisting the NEA and the Humanities Council are just that--they are startup dollars. 
Essentially, these dollars multiply two times, three times, sometimes five times their basic number.

</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-gregg-nh-4-19970916</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GREGG. That is a good question. I think it is one of the questions which we need to answer as we go forward with this bill. And there are a number of amendments--I think the Senator has one; and I believe there are other Senators who are offering them--as to the proper allocation of the dollars between the States and between the National Arts Council which administers the Federal moneys. 
But if I can come back to that point, I want to talk generally about the need for Government support of the arts; and then in the allocation area I would like to come back to that. Because I think, first, we have to reach a consensus that there is a need for any dollars in the arts community to come from the Federal Government or from the State governments, and that consensus is a long way from being reached. Certainly on the House side they appear to be very resistant to that. 
My view is, as I was saying earlier, that there is a need for the Federal Government to play a role as basically the initiator of arts activities, as the incubator that allows the multiplier to occur that creates funding for the arts. 
As Governor of New Hampshire I had the same issue before me as to whether or not the State government should be involved in funding the arts. And at a time when we were having the most severe recession probably ever in the history of the State of New Hampshire, regrettably, and we were having to curtail our funding in a variety of areas and cut them back dramatically, I maintained the arts funding, in fact increased it a little bit in the State because I felt strongly that, first, it gave definition and it gave a way of viewing our culture that was critical and, second, it also had a very positive impact, especially in New Hampshire, on our tourist industry. 
The arts--performing arts especially; but all forms of arts--go hand in hand, at least in New Hampshire, with the ability of the tourist industry, which happens to be our largest employer, to be a successful and vibrant industry. 
So there is an economic benefit of significant proportions to having a strong arts community. The investment which the State or the Federal Government makes in the arts community pays back not only in the way of getting more people involved in the arts, getting more schoolchildren involved in the arts, getting more parents involved with their kids in the arts, but also in the manner of producing economic activity which is fairly significant. 
The Senator from Arkansas has raised a very legitimate issue. I know his amendment raised this issue, an issue I raised in committee as a member of the authorizing committee. I sit on both the authorizing committee and have the good fortune to work with the Senator from Washington on the Appropriations Committee. But he has raised the issue, what is the proper allocation here? I think that is proper for debate. How much of the money should be retained with the central arts planning here in Washington and how much should go out to the States? 
I have always felt a larger percentage should go out to the States because I think that you get more benefit for the dollars spent at the State level. Therefore, a change in the formula would be something that I might well be amenable to. I have actually proposed such changes in committee. But I do think there is also a role, and I do not happen to believe we should eliminate a central arts council that manages a percentage of the dollars out of Washington. 
Why is that? Basically because there are a number of national efforts which do transcend State lines which need to get their funding out of a national fund as versus out of a State fund. 
For example, I believe the No. 1 item chosen by the NEA this year to fund--they have a competition obviously and, unfortunately, sometimes they choose some really poor ideas--but the No. 1 item that was agreed to on their list was to bring back out of mothballs the Egyptian exhibit which is now owned by the Brooklyn Museum. This is one of the most expansive exhibits of Egyptian art and artifacts in the world. It is competitive with the English collection and not completely competitive but certainly representative of even the collections in Cairo. 
These items had been sort of put in storage and collecting dust. Now the Brooklyn Museum has decided to bring them back. And I believe they are taking this around the country. It will be exceptionally educational for a large number of schoolchildren who participate in seeing this exhibit. It will be a national effort. That is the type of initiative that really should be supported from the national level as versus having to be absorbed by, for example, the State of New York which will obviously benefit from this exhibit but actually the whole country will benefit from it because it is going to travel around the country. There are other items, yes, that obviously are of a national nature and, yes, most of those institutions which are of a national nature, whether it be the New York Symphony or some sort of major proposal in Chicago or Los Angeles are centered in your major urban areas. That is just a fact of life. They are centered there for a variety of reasons and, therefore, those major urban 
areas do get a disproportionate amount of the national share of the NEA funding. 
But that is inevitably going to the happen that way as long as you have a national program that is trying to move these various cultural activities across the country. You are going to have to have a place where they are located where they start. The Boston Pops is in Boston, but it certainly has an impact across the country. Therefore, the main art centers of this Nation--and they do happen to be in your major urban areas--are always going to receive a disproportionate amount of the funds. So that does not bother me so much. 
What I do think is legitimate is the question of the proper allocation between the funds going to the National Endowment for the Arts versus going to the States. I do think we can take another look at that formula. I know the Senator from Arkansas is going to make a very aggressive and effective point for restructuring that formula, for restructuring the entire institution. 
I look forward to hearing his position on this. But I did want to make these initial comments first in support of the overall bill which I think the Senator from Washington has done an extraordinarily good job on and, second, in support of the basic thrust of his proposals relative to the endowments which are going to be the most controversial items I guess we will be hearing about on the floor. I yield back my time.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment, which we are now considering, is one which has been discussed already. It is something that has been worked out by the various parties involved. And certainly Senator Coats from Indiana has been the lead in trying to design this settlement of the matter. 
It essentially resolves the matter by making sure that the testing will be done by a totally independent organization, and it will in no way be influenced monetarily--by the monetary involvement of the Federal Government--by the Department of Education, or those forces in the Department of Education who are pushing for a national curriculum. It is, therefore, a totally voluntary effort, and something which I believe deserves our support as an attempt to try to move forward on this issue.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first off, I am a cosponsor of the underlining Collins-Durbin or Durbin-Collins amendment. Second, I am a very suspicious of this tobacco agreement. 
I tend to think that there are some serious concerns here relative to what we are getting and what is being done. And especially I am concerned about the fact that I think the only winners out of this may be the trial lawyers and the tobacco companies. And I don't think that should be the result of the settlement. 
But I also strongly support what Senator Sessions, the former attorney general from Alabama, is proposing here because basically what we have here is an unholy alliance between the tobacco industry and the trial lawyers. 
It was pointed out very effectively by Senator Sessions that there is almost an ethical question here of whether then you pay off the people suing you to stop suing--pay them all off in terms of multiple billions of dollars. We are talking about here potentially $40 billion to $50 billion in attorney's fees, and whether or not when such an occurrence happens, whether you have any sort of agreement which is fair, ethical, or appropriate. So Senator Sessions has raised an extraordinarily legitimate question. 
I think it is extremely inconsistent for those who are opposing the tobacco settlement generally, and who have put forward this amendment--the underlying amendment, which is a good one, to try to knock out at least one section of this proposal which was moved in the middle of the night--for that same position to be arguing on behalf of the trial lawyers, I find that to be entirely inconsistent. 
Moreover, I find the arguments that have been made from the either side to be filled with straw dogs and red herrings. Let's talk about them for a second. 
First is the argument that the Minnesota case wouldn't go forward. Of course the Minnesota case will be forward because the trial attorney's fees, which will be affected by the Sessions amendment, apply to the agreement--not to trying cases when there is a case tried, when it goes to trial, or when it is outside the parameters of the agreement. Then clearly the contingent fee will lie if the case is successful. So that is a red herring in the first order. 
The idea that this is unconstitutional because there is some sort of contract that is being abrogated, obviously it is constitutional because the fact is the Congress is being asked to create this contract. That is what we are being asked to do. There is no contract yet. The Congress is being asked to create a contract. If we are going to be asked to create this contract, we can certainly dictate one of the terms. And one nice term might be that we not end paying the trial lawyers $40 billion but rather pay NIH that $40 billion. In fact, by my estimate you can fund almost all the uninsured health care in this country today. Almost all of the people who do not have health care could be funded if we were to take $40 billion of the trial lawyer's fees and apply it to the uninsured people in this country. And, as a result, for almost a 5-year period I think you would have funding for the uninsured health care of people who do not have health insurance in this country. In fact, in the major debate that we just had over child health care insurance the issue was whether we should go from $16 to $24 billion in order to cover uninsured children in this country today--$24 billion for a 5-year period. 
This $50 billion for trial lawyers--let's put it toward the kids. Let's put it toward health care. It is a heck of a good idea that the Senator from Alabama has come up with. NIH can use this money much better. Uninsured people in the health care community can use this money much better. 
At the absolute minimum we should have some disclosure here as to what is going on. You talk about deals in the middle of the night, which the Senator from Illinois has so aptly pointed to, and the Senator from Maine has so aptly pointed to in the passage of this tax break, which is totally inappropriate, a deal in the middle of the night. This is a deal in the middle of night on some other continent. I mean, we can't even find out what this deal is. At least we found out what the tobacco deal was on the tax side, and the Sessions amendment will get us to the bottom of that issue to find out what the heck really happened here, and how much the attorney's fees are going to be. But we know they are going be massive. Otherwise they wouldn't be fighting so hard to keep us from finding out about them. 
So the Senator from Alabama has raised a totally appropriate amendment. It is a red herring to allege that this in any way assists the tobacco industry. It does just the opposite. The fact is that the trial lawyers have had a stranglehold on, regrettably, this administration. They have seen this administration veto two major product liability bills--the securities bill and the product liability bill, one of which we were smart enough to override, the other of which we couldn't override as a result of the trial lawyer influence. Now when we are trying to get to the bottom of just how much is going to be paid here, how much is coming out of the people's pockets, we run into this argument that it is inappropriate. 
The amendment of the Senator from Alabama is totally appropriate. And I strongly support it.

Mr. GREGG. As I understand your underlying amendment, which has now been adopted, in the case where there is a settlement and the settlement has to come to the Congress to be confirmed, your amendment applies. But, in the case of Minnesota, where there is litigation going forward, and where there is a trial going forward and the matter will be decided by the courts through the litigation process rather than through a settlement confirmed by the Congress, your amendment would not apply.

Mr. GREGG. So basically the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota doesn't apply to the Minnesota situation because the Minnesota situation is outside the underlying amendment. The amendment of the Senator from Minnesota applies to all the other States, except Minnesota, that are trying to reach an agreement through negotiation which has to be confirmed by this Congress.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, just to correct the Record, the $5 million the amendment of the Senator from Alabama presented is $5 million on top of ordinary and customary expenses. So if it cost $20 million or $100 million in the area of expenses to bring this lawsuit, that can be added to the $5 million base cost. 
My opposition--actually I probably will vote for it--but my position on the Durbin amendment is this. In concept, it is an excellent idea. But this is a sense of the Senate. A sense of the Senate means nothing. If the Senator from Illinois really means this, then he should have made it a matter of law. That is what it should be, a matter of law. We should be telling the tobacco companies you have to disclose. This sense of the Senate is a political document. It will give a lot of people in this body comfort politically, but it is not going to do one darned thing to get to the bottom of the question, which is how much are we going to end up paying to attorneys who are basically working with tobacco companies in obtaining their payment? How much is going to get paid to them as part of this settlement? 
The gravamen of this issue--to use the one legal term I remember from my law school days--is the point Senator Sessions made. When you have attorneys working against tobacco companies, and the tobacco company comes in and says, `Well, here's another $1 billion in settlement,' how long do they work against them? How aggressive are they in opposing them? 
If there is $40 billion of attorney's fees going out the door here, which is what is represented in some of the periodicals that have discussed this issue, how can you say that there is any sort of independence on the part of the plaintiff's counsel in the cases? The fact is, there are very few attorneys I know who, if somebody comes forward and says, `Let's make this agreement,' and they say, `No, I can't agree to that,' and then the person who says let's make this agreement says, `Well, I'll give you another billion dollars in fees'--the attorneys are going to say that's pretty hard to turn down. 
Until we know what these attorneys are getting paid, we can't answer a lot of these questions. This Durbin amendment, as well-intentioned as it may be, accomplishes nothing in obtaining that knowledge. It is a sense of the Senate. We all know where those amendments go. This should be a matter of law.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to yield the floor to the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee who needs some time here to take up another issue, but just quickly before I do that, I do want to congratulate the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, for his proposal here, because it has highlighted what is the core debate in the issue of education, which has been raised in part by the President. 
This administration's approach to education is about the same as it has approached campaign finance reform--talks one game; does another game. Basically, the purpose of almost all the major initiatives that have come out of this administration on the issue of education have been to encourage and strengthen the control of the Federal Government over the process of educating children. Every initiative that seems to come out of this administration seems to have been drawn up in the bowels of the major labor unions, major teaching unions here in Washington, the purpose of which appears to be the fundamental goal of moving the control of education out of the local communities and into the Federal sector, out of the hands of the parents, out of the hands of the teachers, out of the hands of the school systems at the local level, into the hands of the Federal bureaucracy, into the hands of the big labor unions centered here in Washington. 
Their education initiatives can almost all be characterized as having that as their basic philosophical groundwork, whether it happens to be their initial proposal on Goals 2000, which luckily was amended so that that did not happen, or their initial proposal on national educational testing, which the President has now backed off of because the country has been alarmed by it and which he is changing. 
What Senator Gorton's proposal does is say, `Let's end it right here. Let's return to the local folks, people who control the educational process, people who should be involved in the educational process, specifically, the parents, the teachers, the principals, local school boards, the capacity to manage the money we have the Federal Government presently controling. Let's end this huge bureaucracy which is draining off billions of dollars annually from the students of this country, turning it over to a class of individuals whose basic goal is to perpetuate their own careers versus perpetuating better education. Let's put an end to that. Let's give the dollars right to the schools. Let's let the schools, the parents, the teachers and the principals make the decision.' 
It really should not be a unique or radical idea. It should be a very common, very appropriate idea. But in the context of the strange thought process which dominates the beltway, it appears to be a radical idea. 
Actually, I congratulate the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, for putting forward this initiative. I think it is going to generate a very huge and positive debate of the question of where the control of education should be. I look forward to participating in that debate. But I do not wish to take further time from the Senator from Delaware. Therefore, I yield the floor at this point.  
Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today, we are debating, in part, the FDA Modernization Act, which is a very important piece of legislation because it goes to the issue of the health and safety of the Nation. I congratulate the Senator from Vermont for having the foresight, ability, and acumen to bring this bill to the floor after a considerable amount of negotiations and debate and discussion and activity within the committee. In fact, we have been working on this ever since I have been on the committee. I believe that would be almost 5 years now. 
The need to modernize the FDA is obvious. I think it is obvious to anybody who represents any group of people, as we hear constantly from folks in our States about problems that they have had with getting drugs, getting devices in a prompt way and in a manner that will help them live better lives. I, for example, had an instance where Helen Zarnowski came to my office fairly regularly over the years as she sought to get approval, or wanted to be able to use various Alzheimer's drugs, drugs being developed that were experimental, in order to help her husband, who, unfortunately, had Alzheimer's. She would come and talk about how terrible this disease is--and it is a horrible disease--and how much she would like to be able to try this drug she had heard about, or that drug which she knew was having positive effects. She had heard about some in Europe that had positive effects, which had been approved there. Yet, unfortunately, the process of approval in the FDA involved considerable delay, delay really well beyond what one would consider to be common sense. Regrettably, her husband died in 1995. Some of the drugs that might have been able to be helpful were not approved by then. 
Of course, we all, I suspect, have friends or people we know who have contracted the AIDS disease and have had problems with AIDS. They are historic. The FDA has started to address that more aggressively in the last few years. In the latter part of the 1980's, that was not the case. Approval was delayed for an extended period of time in a variety of other areas, especially the device area, where people's lives could be improved dramatically by getting a medical device that would assist in their rehabilitation. Or the testimony which was so heart rending and stark, given within our own committee by our own committee member, Senator Frist, a nationally prominent heart surgeon prior to becoming a U.S. Senator. He made it so clear that if he had simply had a device that was available in Europe, he could have possibly saved some of his patients. But he could not get it because the FDA would not approve it in a manner that was timely enough to have it available for those patients. 
So this is a very personal issue. It is brought up in the context of the bureaucracy and the question of this huge institution called the FDA, but when you get right down to it, like most Government, this is a very, very personal issue of people being impacted by their need to obtain care, by their belief that certain types of care that are available maybe in other countries would help them, and their inability to get it in a timely manner in the United States. The FDA has had some real problems. There has been, without question, an attitude that ran well into the early part of this decade that caused FDA to be ponderously bureaucratic in the manner in which it dealt with drug approvals and especially device approvals. That has changed. It has changed for the better. It hasn't gone as far as it needs to go, no. But that is what this bill is about--to give the FDA the capacity to go even further down the road toward being a positive force for the approval of drugs that may help people live longer, live better lives, and for the approval of devices that would help people live better lives. So especially for those individuals who are going to be impacted, this is a very significant piece of legislation. 
In addition, of course, it has the PDUFA language in it, which is critical because PDUFA is the manner in which we fund the expedited approval process for all intents and purposes. And we need to have that fee system reauthorized so that we can keep on board the 600 or so people who are employed through the PDUFA fee process to help us expedite approvals. So that is one approval. In addition, it deals with the question of a variety of questions such as health plans and what can be said. And we approve that language in the bill. The issue of uniformity and how we deal with that--we have improved that language in the bill for a variety of areas. But, most importantly, it is a piece of legislation which will--to use a nice term-- `modernize' the FDA and help us move more promptly to the approval of drugs and devices which will cause for better caring for Americans. 
There has been a lot of discussion on this floor about the question of national uniformity in the area of over-the-counter drugs, and national uniformity in the area of cosmetics. Certainly the Senator from Massachusetts has expanded considerably on this topic. I must say that at an entry point I do find it ironic that this bill would be filibustered because when this bill is filibustered it slows down the approval process for people who have problems, for people who confront diseases and who need new drugs and new devices. And the filibuster by very definition when it was initiated on this floor in opposition to this bill means people are going to have further delays--delays beyond just the bureaucratic delays, which are bad enough --delays which are created by the politics of the process. That is just not right. If the Senator from Massachusetts has a serious concern, which he, obviously, does about one or two items in this bill, he shouldn't be filibustering this bill. He should be offering amendments to the bill letting us vote them up or down and decide whether or not his position has the support of the body, or the bill as it was reported has the support of the body. Clearly a filibuster is totally inappropriate and tremendously ironic in the context of an issue which we are trying to expedite the approval of. And we run into a filibuster. It is bad enough, as I said, to have a bureaucratic slowdown of the approval process. But to have a political slowdown of the approval process is really, I think, unconscionable. 
Independent of that point, let's go to some of the specifics here of the concerns. The issue of uniformity is an issue which has been addressed and discussed at dramatic depths and lengths over the last decade, at least--probably prior to that. That is the only time I recall over the last decade. There have been commissions of very thoughtful people who are extraordinarily expert on the issue of how we deal with the approval process and management of the drug and device delivery system in this country, and who have looked at this. In fact, there was a study, a group, a commission put together headed up by Carl Edwards, who was at one time head of the FDA, and the conclusion of that commission, which was put together at the request of the Congress as early as 1991, was that Congress should enact legislation that preempts additional and conflicting State requirements for all products--not a few, all products--subject to the FDA jurisdiction. States should be permitted to seek a preemption in areas where the FDA has acted based on convincing local needs. States should in addition be allowed to petition for the adoption of national standards. 
That is exactly what is proposed in this bill relative to the two items that the Senator from Massachusetts appears to have problems with--over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics. It should, also, according to this language, have been proposed for food. We should have done uniformity for food if you follow the presentation of this commission proposal. And maybe there will be an amendment coming as we move forward on FDA reform which addresses the issue because I know there is a lot of support on both sides of the aisle for the issue of uniformity on food regulation as well as drugs--over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics. 
But the point here is that an independent, thoughtful, congressionally supported commission headed up by the former head of FDA concluded that this type of uniformity is exactly what we need in order to effectively administer and protect--administer the issue of food and drugs and protect the public. In their 1-year review of their report--1 year later. That was a unanimous agreement, I should have mentioned, reached by the commission, and 14 of the 17 people on this commission said, `We reaffirm our original recommendation that Congress should enact legislation preempting conflicting or additional requirements for products subject to FDA regulation with provisions for the States to be able to demonstrate a genuine need for distinctive requirements to seek an exemption. Failing action by Congress, FDA should adopt regulations to accomplish the same rules for national uniformity.' 
They went a step further. They said even, `If the Congress doesn't go the uniformity route, the FDA ought to do it unilaterally with regulation.' 
I don't agree with that. I think it is the prerogative of the Congress to decide this type of issue. But the fact is they felt so strongly about this as a group of commissioners who had expertise in this area that they asked for that type of an extraordinary action. That would have meant uniformity for drugs, food, over-the-counter drugs, and uniformity for cosmetics. 
Then Commissioner Edwards reaffirmed this point in a letter that he sent to Chairman Jeffords by saying `national uniformity should play a greater role in FDA-State relations. If not, the agency's ability to protect'--this is the issue; how do you protect? --`to protect consumers will be further eroded and unnecessary concerns will be imposed on the national Congress.' 
Former Commissioner Arthur Paul Hayes wrote in July 1997, `I write in strong support of the national uniformity provisions in S. 830 for the nonprescriptive drugs and cosmetics, I have long believed that a single national system for regulations for these FDA-regulated products is essential and now overdue.' 
So you have a commission which was the brainchild of the Congress to determine what FDA should do and how they should manage the issue of drugs, cosmetics, over-the-counter drugs, and food; a commission saying: Use uniformity. Why did they say that? They said it because they believe that to have 51 FDA's running around the countryside--50 States plus the Federal FDA--would create chaos. It would confuse the consumer and create a situation where a consumer in one State was to be given one piece of advice and the consumer in the next State was being given another piece of advice, and as a result, rather than having an encouragement of a comprehensive, thoughtful approach to health protection, you would have confusion and anarchy in the public's mind as to what was correct in the area of health care and protection. 
It is a pretty logical position. I have to say as someone who comes from the States' rights viewpoint, and who has spent most of my life defending States' rights, that it runs against my grain to want one Federal agency to run the country on one issue but, when you think about it, to do it any other way would be to undermine the health, and certainly the veracity and the confidence of the public on the issue of health care provided. 
This is especially true in the area of FDA because even though the FDA has been excessively bureaucratic, nobody would argue that they haven't been extremely professional. They are an agency which has and maintains the view that they are the world's premier reviewer and protector of public health. And I think they have credibility in taking that position. 
That is why I think as a States' rights advocate I am willing--or one of the reasons I am willing--to say yes in this area. The role of the FDA is unique, and to undermine the role of the FDA--that is what you would be doing--to undermine the role of the FDA by allowing the 50 States to basically pursue arbitrary independent views in areas where the FDA has the authority to regulate would be a big mistake. It would run counter to the basic goals of having a strong system of health protection in this country. 
So we are talking here about how you protect the public health. And what we have is a commission set up with the support of the Congress which concluded--we have experts; they weren't Members of Congress on this--concluding that the way to protect the public health is to have uniformity. 
So let's give that a fair amount of credibility. Let's not just discard that. I think that is a fairly persuasive point in favor of the language in this bill which tracks the proposal of the commission, the Edwards Commission, for all intents and purposes, and which was brought forward out of committee with a vote of something like 14 to 4--overwhelming support because the people on the committee who have taken a long time looking at this sort of thing understand that the commission made sense when it came to these conclusions. 
Before I get into the specific responses to some of the points made here, there is another general theme that comes out which is that if you take the argument coming in opposition to the uniformity standards in this bill you are essentially taking an argument that says the FDA can't do its job; the FDA isn't competent; that the States are more competent than the FDA. The corollary to that is you are saying the FDA doesn't care; the FDA isn't really interested in health and safety; that there are areas of health and safety under its regulatory responsibility, under its portfolio, that it has no responsibility, and that it is going to walk away from it. Those are heavy charges to make against the FDA. 
But that is essentially the subtlety of the position in opposition to uniformity: It is that the FDA isn't capable of administering its portfolio and it doesn't care about safety. I personally disagree with that. If anything, the FDA consistently errs in favor of safety, which is probably the right way to do it. We are asking in this bill that they streamline their efforts, that they expedite their procedures, but we are not asking that they do it at the expense of safety. And to imply that they aren't going to fulfill their 
obligations--which is not an implication but basically a statement made here on numerous occasions--citing that only two people are doing this, three people are doing that, to imply that they are not going to fulfill their obligations is I think incorrect. I think the track record shows that the FDA does fulfill its obligations in many ways, and it maybe is a little slow in doing it sometimes. But it sure does get into the issue of safety. And to presume that it would not is I think inappropriate or inaccurate. `Inappropriate' is not correct. Obviously, you can presume anything you want. So that is another point. 
First, we have the commissions' support for this proposal. 
Second, we have the logic of the committees' support for this proposal. 
Third, we have the fact that the FDA is perfectly capable of pursuing this proposal and should be pursuing this approach because a single uniform approach is what makes sense for the health and safety of the American citizenry. 
There were a number of specific points made in representations relative specifically to cosmetics. But you have to remember that cosmetics isn't any different here than over-the-counter drugs for all intents and purposes. Thus, I am surprised with the intensity of opposition of the colleagues; that we don't have the same intensity of opposition to over-the-counter drugs. It seems to be inconsistent to me. And it may just be that the photographs are better for cosmetics than over-the-counter drugs. I doubt that. You can probably find some pretty heinous photographs that relate to over-the-counter drugs. But the fact is that, I think, that is inconsistent. 
In specific, the statement was made that the States will no longer be able to regulate, or to paraphrase it, the States will no longer be able to regulate the packaging and labeling of cosmetics. That isn't really accurate. Nothing preempts State enforcement powers. States may seize, embargo, or pursue judicial proceedings whenever necessary to enforce the law; Federal law; the FDA law.

Mr. GREGG. States are also free to publicize any information or warning they deem necessary. They simply cannot force the manufacturers to post warnings unless they can get the FDA to agree that that warning is legitimate. 
What is wrong with that? Nothing. FDA is certainly going to want a warning on a bottle if it is proven to cause cancer. It is absurd to think they will let the bottle or whatever it is out on the market. If there is some threat that is created by something, the FDA is going to step forward. 
States will have two specific options under this legislation. The States may use the existing authority provided under 21 CFR 10.30 to petition the FDA to make any requirement a national requirement. So they can ask that their proposals, their ideas, be moved up to the national level. Under this provision, States may seek an exemption. If you have a law or requirement that is different from the FDA's, the States can come to the FDA and say we think there should be a national protection. 
For example, the Senator from Massachusetts was talking about the studies in the State of Alaska and what the State of Massachusetts was doing in the area of caring for women. If they feel strongly about that, they can go to the FDA and ask that those types of disclosures which they think are appropriate in the State of Washington and the State of Massachusetts be national. Why shouldn't they? 
The other side of that argument is that, well, women in Washington and women in Massachusetts should get a different warning label than women in New York State or women in Oregon. Why? If it is that serious, why would you want the people in Washington to know something different than the people in Oregon? Obviously, you would not. The logic is that the FDA should make the determination as to whether or not it is serious enough to require national disclosure or to make a determination whether it isn't so that you don't arbitrarily scare the people in one State versus another State. It really makes no sense to have a hodgepodge of disclosures on these over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics, requiring that over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics are not drugs in the traditional sense that they are defined by the statute. Drugs are clearly something that the FDA is going to be involved in. 
So it is just an inconsistency here to this argument that the FDA should not be making the decisions but that the States should be making decisions because you end up with inconsistency from State to State by definition. So I don't think that argument really applies. 
Now, there was another representation that I believe 47,000 injuries resulted last year from cosmetics use. This calculation was not analyzed in its representation, the specifics of it. I think it should be. 
The Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Emergency Injury Surveillance System came up with this figure in a 1988 House hearing. I believe that is what is being referred to here. Their calculation included things such as slipping on soap in the shower, suicide attempts, injuries from broken bottles, plus in the context of total usage 47,000 injuries, some of which clearly weren't involved in the character of a cosmetics, represents .00044 percent, which I believe is less than five ten-thousandths--five ten-thousandths--of the number of products sold in the country; 10.5 billion products sold in the country and 47,000 potentially caused injuries, some of which involved slipping on soap or broken bottles or possibly ingesting things intentionally to cause harm, and that represented .00044 percent or less than five ten-thousandths of the products sold. 
You have to put that in a little bit of context here because, as studied by the same group, injuries caused by couches and sofas were 70,000. Almost twice as many injuries were caused by couches and sofas as were caused by cosmetics. And 117,000 were caused by drinking glasses. Are we going to have that be State regulated--drinking glasses? And 253,000 were caused by pillows, mattresses, and beds. What is that, almost six times the number caused by cosmetics studied by the same group. So when that number is thrown out here, I think it has to be put in context, and I think that puts it in the context of `less than persuasive' would be the adequate term to put to that statement. 
Now, also, the point was made that cosmetics pose an inherent threat to a person's health and safety. I think we just saw from the numbers it is not very inherent if it is less than five ten-thousandths of a percent that are impacted. 
But cosmetics by definition are inherently the safest products FDA regulates. Cosmetics, as defined by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, section 201(I), means: 
Articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance, and (2) articles intended for use as a component of any such articles; except that such term shall not include soap. 
We are not talking about products that affect the structure of any function of the body. Such products are viewed as drugs. So if it affects structure, if it affects function of the body, it is a drug; it is not a cosmetic. 
In fact, former Commissioner Kessler stated in a hearing in the House, again in 1991: 
People can take comfort from the fact that the cosmetics industry is as safe as they come. 
So cosmetics are not inherently dangerous, which would be what you would think if you listened to the debate here for the last couple of days. 
There are problems with cosmetics. Nobody is going to deny that. And that is what we have the FDA for. When there is a problem, that is what the FDA is there for. 
Now, there was another statement, I believe, made that 884 cosmetic ingredients have been found to be toxic. That is a pretty strong statement. Of course, we all know that things that are toxic are things that we deal with every day. Salt is toxic if you take too much of it. In fact, that list included chemicals such as water, salt, and vinegar. This was a list derived from a list published by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances, which list, as I mentioned, included such things as water, salt, and vinegar. 
So toxicity depends on the manner in which it is used and the manner of application as versus by definition that the substance is toxic. `Many substances that are common in everyday life are obviously toxic.' 
Mr. President, 884 ingredients were evaluated by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel to determine if they were toxic. This was not mentioned, I don't think, during the debate. They found no significant health effects with the cosmetic use of any of them. So, again, I don't think that argument is persuasive. 
Then there is the GAO report on which a considerable amount of discussion has been spent. I believe the Senator from Massachusetts was referring to the 1978 GAO report that listed 125 ingredients which were then available for use in cosmetic products that were suspected of causing cancer, 25 that were suspected of causing birth defects, and 20 that were suspected of adversely affecting the nervous system. 
The GAO report goes on to state that: 
Neither we nor NIOSH-- 
Which is the other Federal agency that would have responsibility here; I just quoted their numbers-- 
 has reviewed the adequacy of the tests performed or the applicability of the tests performed or the applicability of the results to exposure to the ingredients through the use of cosmetics. 
They haven't reviewed that. In fact, much of the limited scientific work done before this list was first compiled by NIOSH was done at extremely high exposure levels, rather than against a relative baseline. 
Anytime the FDA would like the Cosmetics Review Panel, in its capacity as an independent expert panel meeting the same criteria as any FDA review board, to review the data, to review the safety data on anything that can be used as a cosmetic ingredient, they may request that it be done. But the FDA has never asked them to do that. The CIR has never denied such a request. The FDA may have asked, but the CIR has never denied the request. The fact is that if something causes cancer and if it were being used in some sort of cosmetic and as a result cancer was being generated, you would have FDA action. 
What do we think the FDA is, a potted plant? They are not going to sit around if there were any cancer-causing substances that were being generated by any cosmetic that were a threat. The idea that a State is going to step up and do a better job of evaluating whether or not there is a carcinogenic effect to anything is, I think, a bit of an affront to the FDA. The fact is the FDA takes cancer pretty darned serious. And they aren't about to walk away from anything or not get involved in anything that has a cancer issue, a serious cancer issue. So bandying around numbers like that may create headlines, but I don't think it is persuasive if you look at the substance of this. 
Now, there has been some representation that FDA doesn't have a whole lot of regulatory authority here. It has a lot of regulatory authority, as was shown again by the Edwards Commission. FDA is the regulatory agency, and that's why there should be uniformity. 
Just let me read a few of these. 
Section 301 prohibits the introduction into, or receipt of, any cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded in interstate commerce. 
Section 303 lists the penalties for violating section 301, starting at imprisonment for up to 1 year and a $1,000 fine. 
Section 601 defines `adulterated'--if it contains a poisonous or deleterious substance; contains a filthy or decomposed substance--we are not even talking about things that are going to cause you cancer here; we are talking about a filthy or decomposed substance--if it was prepared, packaged 
or stored under unsanitary conditions; its container is made of an adulterated substance; or if it contains a color additive not approved by the FDA. 
We heard a lot about color additives earlier. 
Section 706 requires FDA to approve color additives as safe before they can be used in cosmetics. 
Again, we heard a lot about color additives, but the FDA has authority here. 
Section 602 defines `misbranded' as: False or misleading labeling; if the package is not labeled with the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, and with accurate quantity; if any word required by Federal law or regulation to appear on the label is not prominently displayed in a readable and understandable manner; if the container is misbranded; if the color additives don't conform with requirements; or if the packaging or labeling violates the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. 
Section 201(n) states that misbranding must also calculate the extent to which the required facts are not revealed. 
The FDA has broad authority--broad authority--here. And they will use that authority. 
The FDA can ban or restrict ingredients for safety reasons, mandate warning labels, inspect manufacturing facilities, issue warning letters, obtain court orders to seize illegal products, obtain court orders to enjoin activities, prosecute any violators, publicize public health issues, and work with manufacturers to implement nationwide recalls. 
There are 41 pages--41 pages--in the FDA, in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act applying to cosmetics--41 pages. There are 32 pages of FDA regulations of cosmetics in the Code of Federal Regulations. The fact is that the FDA knows this issue and has the capacity to deal with this issue. 
The idea that the States are going to do a better job--well, I suppose that if they are they can come to the FDA, under the law as proposed in this bill and say, `We have done a better job. Change the Federal rule.' And the FDA will do that, because that is what the law gives them the authority to do. Or if they think it is a unique situation, then the States can come and say we want special treatment for this, and the FDA will give them that authority. 
But the point here is that you should not have--and my colleague uses the term women or children a great deal. I think it is just about anybody who would be impacted. But you should not have women in Washington State getting a different instruction from women in the State of Oregon, because it is going to confuse people. Who is going to know who is getting the better instruction, the people in New York versus the people in Massachusetts? Let's have it done consistently, across the country. That is why the commission decided in favor of uniformity. Uniformity on over-the-counter drugs, uniformity for cosmetics, uniformity for food. We don't have food in this bill. Maybe we will. Maybe there will be an amendment. 
There is some representation--I couldn't get it clear but I think there was a representation relative to California's status. Let's define California's status. This law is prospective. It doesn't affect the California situation at all. Prop 65 remains effective in California. So that bit of red herring should be put to bed. 
There has been this representation there are only two people over at the FDA doing this or that. The FDA regulates cosmetics. It has the financial capability--and we will give it the financial capability if it feels it doesn't have it--to have the personnel to do the job right. And I believe that, as part of its portfolio, the leadership of the FDA will do the job right. To say they will not or imply they will not, which is the representation, I think, as I said earlier--the subtle undercurrent of these representations in opposition to this language that the FDA cannot do its job is, I think, incorrect. I think the FDA has shown its capacity. So, resources, here, is not really an issue at all. Resources may be an issue for us as the Congress. But I can assure you that, as a member of the Appropriations Committee--sitting not on the FDA subcommittee but on the overall committee--I would have no problem funding whatever is needed in this area. I suspect none of my colleagues would either. In fact, this bill is about that, with the PDUFA language. It is about funding the FDA in a more effective way. In fact, I put an adjustment in this bill so we would not end up cutting FDA, as a result of the PDUFA funding from base funding, which is critical. 
There was also, I believe, a representation that this prevents the States from providing public information. No, it does not. Under this provision, the States remain free to publicize any information or warning they deem necessary. They simply cannot force manufacturers to post the warning unless the FDA says they agree with it. As I said earlier, what's wrong with that? If a State decides that something needs to be put on a warning label, they can come to the FDA, say, `This is important.' The FDA will evaluate it and tell them, `Yes, it works,' or, `No, it doesn't work.' If you do it another way, you get into this confusing, anarchic situation I spoke about earlier. This is a transient society. People coming from different States are going to see different statements, different warnings. They are not going to know what to think, and that undermines health because it undermines confidence. It's better to have a single agency making that decision because, when you are dealing with health, you have to have confidence. 
There are a couple of specific claims--lead in hair dye was one, I believe. In 1980 the FDA approved the use of lead acetate as a color additive, `safe for use in cosmetics that color the hair.' That approval was based on extensive testing that showed there was no toxicological risk of lead absorption through the skin from lead acetate in hair dye. Hair dye is one of the most stringently tested products on the market today. The FDA has the authority to impose any warning it chooses to promote the continued safety use of hair dye. The fact is, the FDA is engaged in the issue and has made the decisions which it deems appropriate for safety. We should have a consistency across this country, based on what they have decided. 
Mercury in lipstick and nail polish was also cited as an example. Mercury, through the Code of Federal Regulations, has been affirmatively banned for use in all cosmetic products except eye area preservatives, so I am not sure why this idea was thrown out. Maybe it was a red herring. 
`Alpha-hydroxy in face creams causes cancer.' That was, I believe, the representation. Certainly it has been discussed at considerable length as a concern. In 1995, the Office of Cosmetics and Colors' Director stated that appropriate actions can be taken in product characterization or through proper label warning statements in regards to reactions to alpha-hydroxy. So the FDA stepped up to this issue. He noted that the adverse reactions reported--often allergy-type symptoms--could be 
due to the pH factor in the product and not the actual concentration. He did not raise any concerns about it causing cancer. 
If the FDA is concerned that this type of product is causing cancer, it already is investigating such products generally and why would it leave this product on the market? Obviously, it would not. Alpha-hydroxy has been used literally for 3,000 years, in hundreds of different ways. Just this past June the Cosmetic Ingredient Review of this independent group I mentioned before, unanimously confirmed after public debate that alpha-hydroxy is safe for use in a variety of products. However, if there is evidence now, or that comes to light later to the contrary, I am certain that the decision would be reversed and these products would be prohibited nationally. And they should be prohibited nationally if they are that much of a problem. Why should they be prohibited in just one State? Obviously, they should not be. Why would you protect one State over another State? If the legitimacy of the science is such that it is determined that the product is a problem, then obviously the FDA is going to sign on to that debate at that point, and you are going to have a national ban or national warning. 
But to have the people in the State of Washington told one thing and the people in the State of Oregon told another thing and the people in the State of Nevada told another thing--six States in New England that sit right on top of each other such that you can't go shopping without going to one of the other States. At least that is what we hope. We hope that everybody from Massachusetts goes to New Hampshire to go shopping. The fact is, What are you going to do? Are you going to tell them they are going to get a different labeling than they get in Massachusetts? Foolish, worse than foolish, because it undermines confidence in the health care delivery system and the safety and efficacy of it, which has always been the core, always been the core, really, of one of the great strengths of our health care system in this country, which is that we have public confidence in its safety, primarily as a result of the work of the FDA. 
If you have a lot of different States moving into this area you have confusion, and confusion leads to lack of confidence and that is why, again--it was not my idea. It was not the committee's idea to go to uniformity. It was a commission, set up by the Congress, with professionals, who said uniformity makes sense. It not only makes sense, it's essential--essential. So the alpha-hydroxy, I think is, again, a matter of hyperbole, maybe, in this debate. Certainly the photographs have been aggressively used. But is it substantively an issue? No. Because the FDA is already involved in that debate, has made initial decisions on that debate, and if it were determined that there were further decisions that had to be made on that product, it would make them. 
A side point--I believe there was a statement there is no cosmetic hotline. There is a cosmetic hotline. It's at the FDA. In fact I'll give it to people, 1-800-270-8869. Call it up if you have a question. 
As I mentioned, Prop 65 has been addressed. 
So, overall this goes, not only to uniformity of cosmetics, that's just one, the uniformity of over-the-counter drugs, uniformity of management of our health care system in the area of drug protection and quality of the drug delivery system in our country is something that has been concluded to be essential. This bill tries to accomplish that and pursues that course. 
I am not sure what energizes the opposition with such enthusiasm, except the leader of the opposition is an enthusiastic individual. But I do not feel the facts or the substance support any of the--or even a marginal amount of the presentation made from the other side. The facts and the substance support the position of the committee; the position of the committee, which it passed out 14 to 4, which is that uniformity protects the public. It protects the public health, maintains confidence in the public system, and allows us as a nation to deliver better health care. 
I yield the floor to the Senator from Vermont.

Mr. GREGG. I agree 100 percent with what the Senator from Vermont is saying, being from New Hampshire, an equally small State, and knowing it would be confusing to our consumers who cross the borders all the time to purchase products, if they were not able to rely on a nationally regarded, highly expert agency to evaluate their health care products instead of a hodgepodge from the States.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Specter for his leadership and support in my recent efforts to provide full funding for the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act [IDEA]. 
For the past 2 years, one of my top priorities has been to ensure that the Federal Government lives up to its promise to provide 40 percent of the funding for the costs of complying with Federal special education mandates. The current level of 8 percent or 9 percent is unacceptable. In addition, I believe that it is important to secure increased funding for IDEA to ease the burden on local schools and communities. For these reasons, I am grateful to Senator Specter for helping us move closer to full funding to help these communities. 
As a result of our combined efforts, in the fiscal year 1998 Labor-HHS appropriations bill, State grants for part B of IDEA are allocated $3.94 billion, which is a $834 million or 27 percent increase over last year's funding level. As chairman of another appropriations subcommittee, I know how difficult, if not virtually impossible, it is to provide such a significant increase to a large account. Thus, I truly appreciate Senator Specter's efforts and leadership on this issue. I'm sure that the Nation's special education students and the local communities that educate them are equally as grateful to Senator Specter for his support. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Aging Subcommittee, I have spent a great deal of time concentrating on how to improve the ways the nutrition programs and senior services that are part of the Older Americans Act. I appreciate the work of the Senator from New York on this related funding issue. 
In March 1995, I was pleased to have New Hampshire meals provider Debbie Perou-Hermans come to Washington to testify before the Aging Subcommittee; she emphasized the role these programs play for our seniors in New Hampshire and across the Nation. I also know that what we accomplish through the funds spent on other senior services--such as supporting congregate centers, transportation services, and health programs and counseling--is vital to the meeting the requirements of this population. 
I think it is important to note, in addition, that this program has several other important qualities: The Older Americans Act requires the States to invest in these critical services; it has a great track record for leveraging private funds; and it generally makes its services available to all seniors, many of who are suffering from the challenges of social isolation, not just those in financial need. Need wears many faces in America. 
I believe that we should work hard to ensure that the benefits are maximized through more flexibility in the funding of needed services, to be certain that the decisions about how and where these dollars are being spent are made at the State and local level. That will be the goal of the reauthorization bill that I am assembling which will be based on the bill I introduced in the 104th Congress. 
However, I would like to quickly ask a question of my colleague from New York, Senator D'Amato. You stated in your introductory remarks that your goal is to increase the availability of services to our seniors through the infusion of this additional $40 million. But I do not note any specific assignment of these funds. Would the Senator clarify again for me his intention to ensure that these dollars are spent on services that are proven to be effective and efficient, and not to pad the administrative accounts over at the Administration on Aging, or to allow them funds to try new things?

Mr. GREGG. Madam President, as the excellent chairman of the labor subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee mentioned earlier, there is a pending issue which is of considerable significance which has arisen in the last few weeks as a result of the question of how we are going to pursue national testing. The chairman of the committee has mentioned he would hope this issue, from the standpoint of an amendment to the bill, would be taken up for final vote tomorrow sometime. I am certainly agreeable to that. 
However, it had been my intention, along with Senator Coats, to offer an amendment today on this issue, and in talking it over with the chairman he suggested we offer the amendment and then hold the vote until tomorrow. That certainly is an approach which I am perfectly happy to follow. 
This amendment, which is basically directed at codifying what we understand now to be the President's position--and we say `now' because the President's position on national testing appears to have undergone a transformation at some fairly high level of significance. It reflects that decision by the President to no longer push national testing as something that should be controlled and directed by the Department of Education but rather to have national testing to the extent it be developed by independent agencies. Using the term `independent,' I mean agencies which are independent of the Federal Government and which are not under the Federal Government or even under the Federal Government's control through the use of the appropriations process. 
Why is this important? There are a large number of us involved in the issue of reforming education who feel very strongly that national testing makes sense, but to have it controlled by, designed by or in any way managed by the Department of Education here in Washington does not make sense. That would be a fundamental flaw. 
We are encouraged, and we think it is appropriate that the President appears to have come to this conclusion himself over the weekend. Although his initial reaction was to have the Department of Education run this type of a national testing program, his decision now is to move it to the private sector and allow the private sector and the private nonprofits to develop the proper testing standards. 
Why is this important? Because the issue of national testing is important at a variety of different levels. In a positive way it is important because it will give communities an opportunity to compare how their students are doing with other students, to compare how their schools are doing with other schools, compare how their educators are doing with other educators across the country. That is very significant. 
It is not unique, national testing. We have in this country one of the most expansive national testing programs probably anywhere in the world called the SAT test. It comes at the end of the school system, the end of the educational experience, at least as far as elementary and secondary schools are concerned, and juniors and seniors and sometimes sophomores, students in their high school years, will take tests. They have the SAT, the SAT 2, they have achievements, they have advanced placement tests, a whole series of tests which they take, quite a battery of tests. Anybody who has a child going through the SAT experience understands its intensity and recognizes this is one heck of a testing system which we have which is nationally driven which is, in fact, nationally directed, which is, in fact, nationally developed, and which is, in fact, a heck of a good system. I think the reason it worked so well is it has been energized and directed by the private sector of our country, not by the Federal Government. 
The downside of national testing is that if it is done by the Federal Government, at the direction of the Federal Government, under the control of the Federal Government or funded by the Federal Government, you are stepping, in my opinion, and I think in the opinion of many of us who view education as a critical asset of the community, of the State, of people at the lowest level of government who have the right to control how their children's lives are determined in their school systems rather than having it be controlled from Washington, those of us who view that education should be directed locally and not nationally, you are stepping on the slippery slope of once again the issue of national control over curriculum, national control over contents, national control over teachers' standards in the educational system because a federally designed, federally paid for, federally controlled national educational testing system would be, in my opinion and I think the opinion of many people who view this issue and who have looked at it for a while as I have, as being one of the first steps toward a nationally directed curriculum, a nationally directed content in education, and a nationally directed standard for our teachers. 
That is something that I would most vehemently object to and have objected to, and in fact when we went through Goals 2000, raising the issue of national curriculum was the core question. We amended that law dramatically from its initial structure so that it would not end up as a national curriculum exercise. 
Now that we have pushed forward onto the playing field a national testing system, at something other than the end of your high school years, a national testing system which will probably be targeted on the third grade or the eighth grade or maybe both grades, to determine competency, especially in objective types of discipline such as mathematics and science, such a national testing system has to be entered into with some caution to be sure that we do not end up going down the wrong path, that we use it for the purposes for which it should be used, which is to give our local communities the capacity to evaluate how their local school systems are doing in educating their children--not use it with the capacity of taking away from our local communities the capacity to control their local school systems by taking away control over curriculum or taking away control over content. 
So this amendment is basically directed at saying it is not appropriate for the Department of Education to be an aggressive participant, a funded participant in the designing of a national testing system. Rather, that should be left to the private or quasiprivate or nonprofit sector which presently does such a good job in areas such as SAT's. 
The view, which was not the original view of the President and now is the view of the President, is something which we congratulate him on changing his position on and coming to a conclusion that is of that position and which we want to support by passing this amendment. 
Senator Coats and I have put this amendment together. It tracks what was passed in the House, or what is being proposed in the House--I am not sure it has been passed yet--by Representative Goodling from Pennsylvania, chairman of the authorizing committee which deals with education in the House. 
I appreciate the courtesy of the chairman of the committee in allowing us to go forward with it and in his support in going forward with it. We are certainly sensitive to his desire to have the vote tomorrow if there is to be a formal vote, if it is not adopted by agreement, which I hope would be because it does reflect, we believe, the administration position. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating the Senator from Delaware for the extraordinary job he has done in putting together this tax reduction package, which is directed primarily to assisting American families, working families of middle-income means, to make it easier on them to meet the day-to-day expenses of raising a family. It takes giant strides in assisting especially the American middle-income family in dealing with the cost of education, which is absolutely critical. The effort that was put into this by the Senator from Delaware in leading this initiative and pulling this together and getting it passed is nothing short of extraordinary. It will go down as one of the finest hours, I think, in this body and certainly in this Congress. I congratulate him for it. 
I wanted to speak briefly about a couple of areas in the bill that I think are especially positive and for which I thank the Senator from Delaware for working so hard on them. 
First is the area of estate tax reform. We have heard a lot about how this bill greatly helps especially the small businessperson and farmer in being able to retain their business and pass it on to their heirs--their children, in most instances--so they can continue to run the business, so that all the years of sweat equity put in on building a family farm or a small business won't be lost or confiscated on the death of the primary owner of the estate, but rather will be passed on to his or her family, and the tax burden on that small businessman or farmer is dramatically reduced. 
But there is another item in this bill that has not been talked about at all, which I think is especially important in places like New Hampshire, and that is the conservation tax--a tax break for people who leave their land or keep their land in conservation, or in the silviculture activities, upon the death of the primary owner of the estate. This section of the bill, which was initiated by myself and Senator Chafee from Rhode Island, is basically directed at addressing a problem which we see especially in New England. There is tremendous pressure on our forest areas to convert those areas to development. Many people in New England--especially in New Hampshire--run very small tree farms, or operate a lumber business, or a logging business, or a business that in some way uses the forest lands. In addition, there are a lot of people who, just for the purposes of being good citizens, keep their lands open. They don't develop them. They keep their lands in a natural, or fairly close to natural, state, and their lands in many instances are used for recreation or are used for hunting and used, obviously, to maintain the environment. 
Unfortunately, when these folks pass on, because of the nature of New England today and the heavy populations that we have and the expansion of population that we have, in most instances these pieces of land aren't valued for the purposes of 
running a tree farm or maintaining wood lots. They usually are valued for some higher use, defined by the terms of cost, such as a mall or, in many instances, a housing development of some nature. The result of that is that the property in the estate ends up being valued at an extraordinarily high level. The heirs who receive the land have no option but to sell the land, develop the land, and as a result, convert the land from forestry use into some sort of commercial or construction use, which has two events. First, it obviously ends the ability of the forestry industry to use that land for the purposes of maintaining forest and silviculture activity. Second, it ends up developing land. That changes the character of the State in many ways. 
There are a lot of people who would rather not develop the lands. A lot of heirs are willing to keep the land as a production for forestry activities, or as a conservation area, but they can't afford to do that because the taxes are so high. So in this bill, as a result of the efforts of the chairman of the committee, myself, and Senator Chafee, there is now a new deduction that allows people, who agree to do it, to retain their land as a conservation easement when they receive it from an estate and, thus, keep it as land that is protected for the purposes of keeping it in a fairly natural state--using it for timbering if they desire to do so. There will be a deduction relative to the value of that land of about 40 percent, which is a major plus. It is a major commitment to the community, a major commitment, obviously, to the individuals who will be receiving the land, that the Federal Government isn't going to force people to sell their land in order to pay their taxes by putting a value on the land that is so high that they have no option but to sell their land. That is good news. 
Now, this only applies to certain types of land. It applies to land which lies within a certain distance of a national forest or an urban forest. So it doesn't apply to all of the land in New England or all of the land in the country. It does apply to land which is basically in the same area as the area which has already been protected for the purposes of maintaining its pristine qualities. That only makes sense that that type of land should be the land that we are targeting, so that we don't end up with large commercial developments surrounding our national forests and urban forests. 
As a result of this language being put in the bill and the way it was put in, it will actually apply to about 90 percent of New Hampshire because so much of it is a national forest. We have the largest national forest, I believe, east of the Mississippi. Certainly, we have the largest national forest in the Northeast, or the most visited in the Northeast, the White Mountain National Forest, which takes up about 17 percent of the State, I believe. Therefore, it has a very significant land mass within the State. So this is good news for those of us who believe very strongly that maintaining the character of the land, in the State of New Hampshire especially, is critical. This will allow those folks who receive land coming out of an estate to keep that land as forest land, if they desire to do so, and not be forced to sell in order to pay taxes. That is a very big plus. 
The second element I want to congratulate Senator Roth for deals with retirement provisions in this bill. There is a very positive expansion of the ability of people to save for retirement in this bill. Of course, there is the famous Roth IRA accounts, which we heard a fair amount about, which are a series of expansions of IRA accounts. More important, this is a whole series of initiatives which came out of a working group I chair, the leadership task force on retirement reform. Thirteen of those items are in this bill. They give the small businesspeople in this country much more flexibility in putting in place retirement accounts and gives individuals much more flexibility in the area of being able to participate in saving for their retirement, and they are very strong initiatives. 
I will say a few words about what this tax bill will mean to American families and to their ability to save for retirement. 
Earlier this year I was named to chair a Republican Retirement Security Task Force. We introduced a series of reforms as S. 883. 
Senator Roth's contribution to the task force's work was vital. I also appreciate his willingness to work in favor of many of these provisions in this tax legislation. 
This Nation faces a dire need to expand retirement saving to meet the retirement needs of an aging 21st century population. 
But behind this general national picture are the real-life concerns of millions of hard-working American families, who are concerned about their prospects for retirement. This bill will significantly increase their chances to achieve a dignified and secure retirement. 
I would like to describe some of these provisions and the effect that they would have for families. 
Consider a family, John and Mary Smith, where John is a full-time paid employee, and Mary is working within the home. Or, perhaps Mary is working full time, and John is working within the home. Between them, they earn $50,000. And suppose that John, but not Mary, is able to participate in a pension plan at work. 
Under the old law, this couple could not make a deductible contribution to an IRA. But under this bill, now Mary can make a fully tax-deductible $2,000 contribution to an IRA. 
And the same is true whether this family earns $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000--on up to $150,000. Because of this tax legislation, a huge number of families will now be able to participate in tax-deferred IRA accounts. 
An article in the Washington Post this morning indicated that fully 7 million new IRA accounts will be opened because of this measure alone. Think of what that will do for a couple's retirement security--if they are able to put away $2,000, tax-deferred, every year. 
Consider another couple: Michael and Susan Jones. Suppose they have a family farm. And because of the fortunes of farming, their income goes up and down from year to year. Perhaps one year they earn $50,000--and the next year they only earn $30,000. 
Under current law, this couple is going to be very concerned about whether they can save in an IRA. They don't know whether their contributions will be tax-deductible or not. One year it is, the next year it isn't. It's very difficult for them to know, as the year progresses, whether they can afford to put the money in. 
Under this legislation, we have created something new for them--the back-loaded IRA. Now Michael and Susan can make contributions to an IRA without worrying about whether they will get the tax benefits--because those tax benefits will come at the end of the road. They don't get the tax deduction now, when they contribute to the IRA, but they know that at the end of the game, they will have tax-advantaged earnings through the IRA. This legislation gives them a new way to gain tax advantages from savings. 
And, this legislation also vastly expands traditional IRA accounts--doubling the income limits for tax deductibility over the next 5 years. As a result, millions of Americans will find it easier to save for retirement. 
This legislation also contains many of the pension reform provisions which we worked so hard to create in S. 883. 
This legislation increase the security of employer-provided pensions--by increasing the amount of employer funding to meet those pension liabilities. 
Under current law, Mr. President, most employers do not have enough funding in these pension plans to meet eventual liabilities. Not because the employers won't do it--but rather because the Government won't let hem. We had 
sharply limited the amount of funding that employers may put in these pension plans. 
So when Frank Williams goes to work, there is often only enough funding in his pension plan to support benefits that he would receive if he and everyone else in the company retired today. Frank hopes to work longer, to accrue a larger pension benefit someday, as does everyone in the company. And the liabilities of the pension plan will eventually be much larger, because everyone working there will someday be entitled to much higher benefits than are accounted for in current measures of liability. 
Under this legislation, we will raise the limits on employer funding of pensions--from 150 percent of current liability to 170 percent. Employers will be permitted to fund at a level that is closer to their projected liability. This means greater retirement security for all Americans. It means that there will be more funds in Frank Williams' pension plan. 
Now consider the case of another hard-working American, Walter Taylor, an aspiring entrepreneur, starting his or her own business. Under the old law, if he started a pension plan, and he was therefore paying both the employer match and the employee contribution for his own pension benefits, he would not get the same tax treatment that other employers get. This legislation will create a level playing field for the self-employed, and says that they too will receive the same tax treatment of their matching contributions that other employers receive. 
This will be a tremendous benefit to small businesses, which is where we most need to expand pension coverage. 
This legislation will also make it easier and more convenient for families to save through IRA's--by facilitating automatic payroll deductions into IRA's. 
This legislation will also make it easier for State and local government plans to operate, by exempting them from the cumbersome nondiscrimination rules that were not intended for Government plans. 
This legislation will streamline and simplify paperwork and reporting requirements. It will eliminate the need for obsolete and unnecessary forms, and will also facilitate the use of electronic technology to replace old paperwork. 
Finally, the legislation will make a number of technical corrections to the law, straightening out inconsistencies between tax and regulatory treatment of pension contributions, inconsistencies that have frustrated employers and pension administrators alike. 
I am pleased to have been the principal sponsor of these provisions, and I commend and thank those who have worked to bring us closer to enacting them into law. 
Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for allowing me to precede her. I thank the Senator from Delaware for allowing me to speak and for his extraordinary effort.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth], included language in this tax bill, H.R. 2014, the Revenue Reconciliation Act, which promotes land conservation through the use of conservation easements and allowing the postmortem election of these easements. Still, I believe that more must be done in the future to ensure that forestland, especially in the Northeast, is preserved. This issue is of particular importance in the Northeast, where 85 percent of our forestland is in private ownership.

<TEXT>
Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me speak briefly on the budget agreement which was reached late last night, and mention my thoughts on this. This agreement is obviously not everything that everybody wanted. But it is a giant step in the right direction. It is especially a giant step on the issue of cutting taxes for the working American family, or that group of Americans in the middle-income brackets who are struggling with the costs of raising children and sending those children to college. 
For a family whose income is in the range of $32,000 or $35,000, this tax cut could well represent a tax cut of almost 50 percent for a family of four. That is a big tax cut. For that same family, should they have a child who is headed off to college, this could represent a tax cut of up to 75 percent. That is a huge tax cut. 
In addition, if you are in a working family situation and you are trying to make ends meet, you are going to be able to take advantage of this child credit coming to you to help you support the cost of raising your children--$500 per child. And all of these tax cuts that I am talking about are directed at middle-income Americans. In fact, almost all of them phase out as you get into incomes over $100,000. 
Further, if you are a family where one of the spouses is staying at home to try to raise your children, under today's law, you can't have an IRA account that is deductible. That stay-at-home spouse can't have an IRA account that is deductible. Under this bill, the mother that is home raising the children will have the opportunity to have an IRA account that will be deductible and safe for her retirement. That is a major step forward. 
In addition, there is a significant estate tax savings, especially for small business people and for farmers. Estate tax savings, which means that when somebody works all their life to build up a grocery store, a restaurant, or a gas station business, or some other small business, they are not going to lose that business to taxes when they die. They are going to be able to pass on that business to their children. That is very important. 
So this is a major step forward. It is the first significant tax cut--it is the first tax cut for middle-income Americans in 16 years. 
It should have been done a long time ago. But it has taken a Republican Congress and a commitment of a Republican Congress to have this as our No. 1 goal, and a commitment to accomplishment. While we have accomplished this tax cut, we have at the same time put in place a spending pattern which controls the rate of growth of Federal spending so that we can reach a balanced budget by the year 2002. We may even reach it before that, according to present estimates. But that was another major goal of this Republican Congress--to balance the budget. 
So we have done two very significant things here. We have balanced the budget, and we managed to cut taxes for working Americans, and especially for working Americans who have families to raise. That is good news. Is it everything we want? Of course not. I would like to see more action in the area of Medicare, for example. But the will wasn't there--both at the White House and, unfortunately, in the other body. But as a practical matter, the spending restraints in this bill are very significant. 
The rate of growth in spending in this bill is approximately one-half of 1 percent over the next 5 years in discretionary nondefense accounts--one-half of 1 percent. That is the lowest rate of growth of spending that has occurred in the last 20 years in this Government in the area of discretionary accounts. That is significant. Because we have that low rate of growth of spending on the discretionary side of the ledger, we are able to bring into balance the budget agreement of this Government by the year 2002. We will have to go back and we will have to revise the issue of Medicare. There is no question about that. That remains a big issue of public policy. But within the Medicare accounts we made some very substantive and positive changes in this bill. 
In the spending package is the proposal for Choice Care. Choice Care gives seniors approximately the same type of options which we as Members of Congress have--the ability to go out into the marketplace and choose from a variety of different health care plans. The practical effect of that is to bring the market forces into play to control the rate of growth of the cost of Medicare and, at the same time, give seniors much more choice, many more options, in the way they get their health care provided. Choice Care is a very positive, substantive, long-term reform for the Medicare system, and it is in this bill. So there were significant steps taken in that account, too. 
But, most importantly, you have to return to the fact that not only do we balance the budget, but we give these very significant tax cuts to working Americans--especially working Americans who are trying to raise a family. Isn't it about time? This is relief that is long overdue. As this Government finally gets its fiscal house in order, as we move toward a balanced budget, who should be the recipient of that positive event, of that good fiscal management? Well, the people who paid for the Government should be the recipient of that. 
That is what this bill essentially does. It turns back to those folks who are paying the cost of the Government some of their hard-earned dollars so that they can make the decision as to how they are spent rather than having that decision made here in Washington. We do not happen to believe, those of us who support this tax cut, that the Federal Government is a better manager of your dollars if you are running a household than you are. We think that if you have money to decide how you want to raise your children and to use it on spending for your children's education, you are going to do a better job of spending that in educating your children than if the Federal Government takes your money, brings it here to Washington, and then redistributes it to you. 
So this tax cut is a very important event, and a big win--a big win--for the working American family. Thus, I am certainly hopeful that we will pass this package later this week and make that major step forward, or that significant step forward, in assisting families in this country meet the costs of raising kids and see that at the same time we move this Government toward a balanced budget.

The tempo and culture of that experience has been one which has been intertwined with our Nation's strengths and, unfortunately, some of our Nation's failures. 
Their statements today, I think, as well as anything that I have ever heard, reflect the energy and enthusiasm and vitality and warmth that that church presents to its parishioners and which makes it such a dynamic force in the faith of many people across this country and across the world.

Mr. GREGG. This request I just made also includes both majority and minority staff. 
Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce this bill, S. 1022, for the fiscal year 1998 appropriations for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related agencies. This year we have taken great strides to obtain bipartisan support for this bill and to be responsive to the needs of the people within the budget that we are provided. I think we have achieved this goal. 
I want to especially acknowledge and thank the ranking member of this committee who for many, many years has served on this committee and whose cooperation, effort, and knowledge has been a core element in developing this bill and achieving progress in making these agencies function effectively. And that, of course, is the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings]. 
The bill before us includes $31.6 billion for programs administered by the Commerce, State, and Justice Departments, the Judiciary, and related agencies. That is a lot of money, $31.6 billion, but I would note that it is a bill that is frugal. It is $4 billion less than what the President's budget request, and it is over $100 million less than what the House will have passed in its bill in this area. 
The essential thrust of this bill is to make sure the committee adequately funds the activities of our criminal justice system and to make sure that the States receive adequate funding to undertake an aggressive posture to control the spread of violence and crime in our Nation. As a result, we have increased funding for the Department of Justice by 5 percent over 1997 levels. This represents a fairly significant commitment to that Department, obviously. 
Within the Justice Department, top priorities include fighting crimes against children; providing assistance to State and local law enforcement; countering terrorism activities; bolstering drug control efforts; and pursuing new juvenile programs. 
As chairman, I directed the committee to take a close look at the needs of the juveniles in our country. In hearings this year, it was brought to my attention the threats our children face when surfing the Internet. While the Internet can be a place for the world to be at play and to be at the access of children's 
fingertips, that world can also have its shady side where predators lurk to exploit our children if given the opportunity. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI], along with organizations like the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, has worked to combat pedophile activity on the Internet. In our legislation we provide funding to continue these efforts: $10 million for the FBI to apprehend the pedophiles who use the Internet in their criminal activities; $2.4 million to the local and State law enforcement agencies to form specialized cyber units to investigate and prevent child sexual exploitation; and $6.2 million for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to continue their efforts to educate and work with law enforcement officials in handing child exploitation cases. 
Also, the committee believes it is in the national interest to improve the skills of our law enforcement personnel on all levels and supports initiatives to do this. The Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS Program, is funded at $1.4 billion so that 100,000 extra police can be hired by our States and our communities. The President's request did not include any funding for the local law enforcement block grant. However, we have provided $503 million so that localities could obtain funding for initiatives to reduce crime and improve public safety. 
Also, in response to a number of requests from law enforcement officials, we have added $10.5 million to the President's request for a regional information sharing system so that law enforcement officers throughout the country can have increased access to national crime databases. 
This year the committee has taken a strong stance against the violent acts that are directed toward women and children. 
Our support includes a $67.3 million increase in the funding for the Violence Against Women Act grants. We recognize the need to enhance and expand current women's assistance programs as violent crimes against them continue. Violence Against Women Act grants will be given to the States to develop and implement effective arrest and prosecution policies to prevent, identify, and respond to violent crimes against women. This funding provides domestically abused women and children with additional support services. This includes access to specially trained prosecutors and law enforcement officials. Only 20 States received Violence Against Women grants in 1996. We believe there should be sufficient funding for more States to participate in this program. Consequently, we have appropriated funds for this effort. And while we have given significant funding to the Violence Against Women Program, other grant programs still receive funding--the Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Program, the State Prison Grant Program, and the Missing Alzheimer's Patient Program, just to name a few. 
The Counterterrorism Fund received $29.5 million so that the law enforcement officials can counter, investigate, and prosecute those people who are involved in terrorist activities. In addition, the funds will be used to conduct terrorism threat assessment against Federal agencies and their facilities. Additional funds have been provided in a classified portion of the bill, which is available to all Members. 
Like many Members of Congress, the committee is concerned about the proliferation of illegal drugs coming across our borders and its impact on our children. In an effort to support law enforcement efforts to combat the rampant spread of illegal drugs, the committee devoted $16.5 million to combat the trade in methamphetamine and $10 million to the effort to reduce heroin trafficking. The committee also provided substantial funding for the Drug Enforcement Administration program to provide adequate equipment for its agents. It does no good to hire new agents--and we are hiring a large number of new agents in this bill--if they do not have the equipment needed to do the job. So this bill takes care of that issue. 
Over the last few years, the infrastructure needs of organizations funded by this bill have been neglected. We have 
made a point of providing funds to repair buildings throughout our agencies. Over $300 million will go to the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Prisons to make much-needed infrastructure improvements. This money covers the costs of a new FBI forensics lab at Quantico, State prison grants to help States build new prisons, and facilities for 1,000 new Border Patrol agents we have funded through the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
As last mentioned within the Justice portion of the bill, the committee sets aside funding for a Juvenile Block Grant Program, subject to the authorization of the Judiciary Committee. It is our understanding that the authorization may address such issues as the need for increased penalties for criminal street-gang activities and prosecuting violent youth offenders as adults at the discretion of the prosecutor. This funding should assist in undertaking that effort. 
This is just a brief summary of a wide range of Justice provisions that will help law enforcement combat the threats that Americans face in our daily lives. 
In the area of the Commerce Department, we have made some difficult decisions, but I think they are constructive ones. We have, for example, provided strong support for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which provides high-quality research and provides technical data to our economy. In particular, the bill increases funding for the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is important to all coastal and Great Lakes States and provides funding for estuarine research. Since 75 percent of our Nation's population lives near the coastline, placing a priority on preserving our estuarine areas is important. Equally important is the need to conserve the resources that live in our estuaries and oceans. 
The bill increases funding for protected species research. The Sea Grant Program, which conducts research of regional importance through colleges and universities, is strongly supported in this bill. While we believe NOAA is doing essential work for America, sometimes we disagree with our House colleagues on the level of funding. We intend to address this in conference, and we will go to conference with a strong bill. 
The committee provides increased funding for the National Weather Service, also. Many of us are concerned that this agency has the resources necessary to ensure timely warning of severe weather, especially hurricanes and tornadoes. The bill contains funding for satellite improvements which are critical to monitoring and predicting the weather. The committee supports the modernization of the Weather Service and looks forward to working with the Department of Commerce to ensure the orderly deployment of technology needed to improve forecasting and warnings. 
The largest increase in the Department of Commerce is the administration's request for additional funds to prepare for the decennial census. We have had previous discussions on the Senate floor about whether or not to use a sampling technique to conduct the census 2000. The bill contains language on this issue developed on a bipartisan basis during the consideration of the Supplemental Appropriations bill earlier this year. The increase for fiscal year 1998 does not require a decision on whether or not to employ sampling. 
The committee also funds the trade development and enforcement responsibilities of the Department of Commerce at or slightly above the administration's requests. The Bureau of Export Administration has two new requirements which deserve mention. First, the Department of State's encryption export control responsibilities have been transferred to the Export Administration. 
Second, with the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), the Export Administration will have the primary responsibility for enforcing the convention. While funds are provided at the requested level to support the Export Administration's enforcement responsibilities, any additional funds which may be needed during fiscal year 1998 should be provided by 
the Department of Defense or the Department of State. There is some concern that the administration has underestimated the funds needed to enforce CWC. The Department of Commerce should not be required to shoulder all the costs of Chemical Weapons Convention enforcement. 
Many Senators will be glad to hear that the committee did not agree with the administration's request to zero out public telecommunication facility grants. We went ahead and provided $25 million for this program based on the strong bipartisan support it enjoys. 
In the judiciary area of the bill, the committee had to confront some difficult issues, but I believe we have provided the American people with a better judiciary through our efforts. The appropriation is sufficient to maintain current judicial operation levels and takes into account the increase in bankruptcy caseloads and probation population. We are also providing the Justices and judges with a 2.8-percent cost-of-living adjustment requested by the President. 
The largest change--and it is a change I think will be for the best--is that the ninth circuit Federal court will be split into two circuits, reducing the caseload level in each to a manageable level. During the 1996-97 session, the Supreme Court overturned 96 percent--96 percent--of the decisions reviewed by the ninth circuit. This high overturn rate is a beacon that the Ninth Circuit is not meeting the needs of the people it serves. Last Congress, Chief Judge Wallace stated in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that `it takes about 4 months longer to complete an appeal in the ninth circuit as compared to the national median time.' The caseload continues to increase yearly. 
Justice Kennedy of the Supreme Court testified before our committee on April 17 that there are `very dedicated judges on that circuit, very scholarly judges. * * * But, [he thinks] that institutionally, and from a collegial standpoint, that it is too large to have the discipline and the control that is necessary for an effective circuit.' 
While some of my colleagues may disagree, the facts lead me to believe it is past time for the ninth circuit to be split, and we are going to hear a considerable amount of debate on that issue later today. 
Lastly, for the judiciary, we are providing an additional $2.2 million to the Supreme Court for renovations in an effort to comply with safety regulations and with the Americans With Disabilities Act at the Supreme Court building. 
Moving on to the State Department, we have fully funded to the best of our abilities, the operations carried out by this Department. We made sure that the day-to-day functions of the State Department are funded at an acceptable level, and we are going a long way toward updating their outdated technology systems. 
Maintaining infrastructure was a top priority of mine in funding this bill. To do this, we are providing $40.4 million above the President's request for the Capital Investment Fund so that desperately needed upgrades on information and communications systems can be done. It is quite alarming to hear that the State Department is still using Wang computers and that oversees, about 82 percent of the radio equipment, 55 percent of the computer equipment, and 40 percent of the telephone systems are obsolete. These are the people who are representing us in foreign countries and they deserve to have up-to-date equipment. 
As a final noteworthy item, this bill covers the U.N. arrears as agreed to during the budget talks this year, in addition to supporting the bicameral U.N. reform package found in S. 903, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1997. The international organization and peacekeeping efforts are also included in this appropriation. 
This is a very quick rundown of a very complicated and expansive piece of legislation. I believe it is an extremely strong bill, complying with the ideas that have been guiding the budget process over the last few months. As I mentioned earlier, it is under the President's request and under the House bill. Yet I believe it still represents a sound and strong commitment to the agencies which it has to cover. 
Before turning this over to my esteemed colleague and ranking member, I want to recognize the contributions of my staff, which have been extraordinary, the members of my staff that I outlined earlier, Kevin Linsky, Paddy Link, Vas Alexopoulos, Jim Morhard, Carl Truscott, Dana Quam, Josh Irwin, and Luke Nachbar; and I also want to acknowledge the ranking member's staff, who do such a super job--Scott Gudes, Emelie East, and Karen Swanson-Wolf. Their help has made a tremendous difference, and we would not have gotten to this point without their assistance. 
I yield to my ranking member.

<TEXT>
Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the Senator from Kansas. The ATP issue has been one of the more contentious issues that we have dealt with within our committee. Last year, it was more contentious than this year because of an agreement reached between the White House and the leadership of the Senate and House. The House and Senate and the White House agreed that this program would be funded. I suspect that they agreed it would be funded because of the strength of the arguments made by the Senator from South Carolina, but I think most people appreciate the fact that I have, since my tenure on this committee, opposed funding for this program. It was over my strong objection that this decision was made. But it was made and I have agreed to live by the budget agreement and, therefore, the money for ATP is in there. 
But if you acknowledge ATP even as a program that should proceed forward because of whatever arguments we are inclined to accept, it is very hard to understand how we can justify using a program, the purpose of which is to encourage the development of technologies which might not otherwise evolve. That is the key here--they might not otherwise evolve. It is very hard to justify such a program being used to fund Fortune 500 companies' research initiatives. The fact is that Fortune 500 companies, companies with over $2.5 billion in sales, have the capacity to pursue any technology they wish to pursue if they determine that it has some value, if it has some economic value and if it is going to produce some sort of worth to them. And it's very illogical to presume that those companies would not pursue those technologies if they felt there is a value and they have the wherewithal to do it. You have essentially created a piggy bank into which these companies can step or put their hands into if they desire to pursue a technology, which they probably would have pursued anyway if they had the financial wherewithal to do it. But in this instance, there are Federal dollars available, so they say let's use the Federal dollars instead. 
I think it is much more logical to focus this fund on those entrepreneurs and entities which do not have that sort of flexibility, do not have in-house the capital wherewithal to fund whatever research they desire. That is why I believe we should limit access to these dollars to the smaller companies. And smaller is a relative term here. We are talking about companies up 
to $2.5 billion of gross sales. That is a pretty big entity. I suspect there are a lot of major companies that fall into that category. In fact, within the State of New Hampshire, I am not sure how many companies would have more than 2.5 billion dollars' worth of gross sales; it would not be many. We are retaining the availability of this program to the vast majority of corporate America and to all of the entrepreneurial world. 
It is not as if we were handicapping for purposes of this exercise. In fact, there isn't enough money to go around as far as applications are concerned. There are a lot of applications that are not approved. In fact, the Senator from South Carolina cited one in his own State. It just seems much more logical to me that we take this money and, rather than giving it to folks who have the capacity to pursue this research independently and on their own and are simply using the Federal dollars to replace dollars that they would spend anyway, that we give it to companies--or make this money available to entities that do not have the financial wherewithal to pursue these programs; or if they do have it, they would be under more stress than a company that has 2.5 billion dollars' worth of income. 
So the amendment of the Senator from Kansas makes an immense amount of sense. It is not a dagger in the heart of this program. In fact, I think it is a strengthening amendment for this program. It will significantly improve the nature of this program. And, really, I am a little bit surprised at the intensity of opposition to it because it appears to be an effort to logically and fairly approach this program, rather than just eliminate it, which would be something that many of us would support also. 
So I think the Senator from Kansas has brought forward an excellent amendment. I hope that we can pass it. I will certainly support it.

Mr. GREGG. I was wondering if the Senator would be willing to enter into a time agreement so that we could move on with the bill. The Senator mentioned that after he had spoken for a while he might be willing to consider that. He has spoken now for approximately 40 minutes and the other side has taken approximately the same amount of time. 
I was wondering if we could enter an agreement which would limit debate to an additional hour with the time equally divided between the proponents and the opponents and have a vote here at 4:30.

Mr. GREGG. If there is no objection from the other side, I would ask unanimous consent that the vote on the pending amendment be at 4:30, with the hour equally divided. 
I would ask, additionally, after the vote on the second-degree amendment offered by Senator McConnell, if the next matter before the body could be the matter of the ninth circuit and the amendment of the Senator from California.

Mr. GREGG. And the Senator from Arizona is asking for 10 minutes. I would suggest that neither myself nor the Senator from South Carolina, both of whom are involved in this issue, have had an opportunity to speak. So we may have to add a little bit more time. Why don't we add an additional--have the vote be at quarter of 5, add an additional 15 minutes with the time, an hour and 15 minutes equally divided, and 10 minutes to the Senator from Arizona. Is that acceptable?

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment that is pending and in support of the underlying bill, obviously. I think the Senator from Arkansas had certainly outlined rather effectively the problems with NED, the expense of this program, and the fact that the program, for all intents and purposes, involves a passing of Federal tax dollars, hard-earned tax dollars, on to a number of groups for the purposes of exercises which are of questionable value in the post-cold-war period: the Democratic National Committee, Republican National Committee, the AFL-CIO, and the Chamber of Commerce being the primary beneficiaries of this fund. 
I call this the club fund. You know, here in Washington there are a lot of folks who are sort of part of a club. The city has a bit of a clubby atmosphere. It is a you-scratch-my-back-and-I-scratch-your-back club. This is sort of one of the funding mechanisms for the club. I am not too surprised that some community of the press supports the exercise because the club, regrettably, involves some of the press, too. But, as a practical matter, there is very little substance done here. 
Let's take China, for example. I suppose if there is an example of a nation where we have concerns about democracy and its impact on our future as a country, China is probably it. How valuable is NED in relationship to China? Well, last year NED sent a lot of people over there. A lot of people took airline flights over there. There were a lot of good trips, I am sure, to China. China is a nice place to visit. I am absolutely sure of that. A lot of people had an opportunity to go there, people who were 
members of the Republican National Committee, Democratic National Committee, AFL-CIO activists, Chamber of Commerce activists, people who are friends--a lot of people who were friends of members of these different organizations went on trips. All of them went to China for a variety of meetings, and NED committed $2 million for various programs. They had about, I think, about 20 or 30 different meetings in China to tell China how to become a democracy; $20 million for 1 billion people. That works out to about 2 cents a person. I think they must have distributed toothpicks that said `vote' on them for 2 cents a person. 
The fact is, it had absolutely no impact. All it did was represent a nice trip for a bunch of folks from the United States who probably looked forward to going to China and meeting some folks in China. 
The inverse, of course, is that when China tried to influence our elections, I think we generated a fair amount of outrage here in the United States about that. We are still looking for Charlie Trie. Maybe he is working for NED in China now. The fact is, the influence of elections in the United States by a foreign country tends to really antagonize a few people--as it should, in the post-cold-war period. And vice versa. You know? Vice versa. 
So what's the purpose of NED? The purpose of NED is to, for the most part, be a nice gathering of folks who find it is a very effective way to fund various trips, various get-togethers around the globe. What does this amendment suggest we do to pay for these trips, to pay for this club activity? What is the suggestion of the way they are going to fund this? They are going to take the money out of the State Department capital account. 
Yes, the White House did not ask for as much money in the capital account as we put into it, because the White House wanted to spend the money on the United Nations and on international operations, international organizations. So they raided that fund for that account. That is a little more legitimate than NED but not a whole lot more legitimate than NED when you are talking about the capital account of the State Department. 
I submit to the people who are supporting this amendment that maybe they should read a few of the reports from the State Department about the present status of the State Department's capital situation. Maybe the people who offered this amendment would like to call up the United States on a dial telephone from Lagos. Maybe the people who offered this amendment would like to be working on a Wang computer that cannot communicate with any other computer in the United States. That is what we subject our people to at the State Department. 
The present infrastructure of the State Department is a disaster. They can't call home. And the practical effect of this amendment is that a lot of them aren't going to be able to call home. Or maybe when you have a constituent who has a family member who has run into a serious problem in one of these Third World nations and you are out trying to help your constituent out, you are going to be really upset that the State Department can't communicate with its people in the field effectively because 82 percent of the State Department radio equipment, 55 percent of their computer equipment, and 40 percent of their telephone equipment is totally obsolete. 
So what does this amendment suggest? It suggests we keep it obsolete so we can fund a bunch of folks at the Republican National Committee, Democratic National Committee, the AFL-CIO, and the Chamber of Commerce--who happen to have the best computer equipment in the world, the best communication equipment in the world--so we can fund them for their trips. What an absolute outrage. 
I cannot believe that we would consider doing this to the people who work at the State Department. It is an absolute affront. This is important. Yes, somebody said, this is serious business. You are darned right this is serious business. This is very serious business. You go out to these embassies in some of these Third World countries and you see what we subject our people 
to, and it is not right. They take their families along with them. They take their families along with them, and they get into some of these countries where Americans aren't all that popular, and their families are driving to work some morning, or driving to school, and their lives are threatened and they have no secure vehicles to travel in because we can't fund it--because we can't fund it. But we can fund a first-class airline ticket to China for somebody here in the United States to go to a meeting to talk about stuff and come back and have a good time on the trip. But we can't fund the protection of an American family serving overseas. It's really incredible. 
I heard somebody on this floor citing an editorial from the Wall Street Journal, or some commentary in the Wall Street Journal. You tell me the last time a reporter at the Wall Street Journal used a Wang computer to file their story. You tell me when that happened. Wang was a great company. It started right down the road from where I live. We were very sad to see it go by the way. The fact is that it did. Yet we still ask our people in the field to use Wang computers. 
This amendment takes from the capacity of the guys and women who are in the field doing the job of presenting American policy, it takes out of their hands the capacity to do their job and gives it to a bunch of folks who may be well intentioned but who do not accomplish a whole lot. 
I just find it unbelievable that the account into which you would dip to pay for the NED is the account which is absolutely critical to upgrading the State Department and giving our people in the field an adequate opportunity to represent us. But that is the amendment, and I look forward to this vote with some enthusiasm because this is going to be a real test of who really cares about the future of our State Department. 
I yield the floor.

Were this a judicial proceeding, there is something called judicial notice. That is like water runs downhill and the Sun comes up in the East. I think the Court would take judicial notice of the fact the ninth circuit does not work; it is too big; it has too many people for one circuit to manage; it has too many judges to work effectively; it has too large a geographic region. This is an attempt to address that issue. It is a very important issue to address. It is an affordable issue to address. I hope my colleagues will vote down this amendment.

Those of us who have been to Caribou understand that it is the coldest place in America, consistently, and recognize that the issue of weather and predictability of weather is very important. Also, I know how important upgrading the Caribou Weather Service Office into a Weather Forecasting Office is for the people of Aroostook County. It is a major issue, and I can understand how strongly my friend and colleague from Maine feels about this matter. 
The Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, has made a very persuasive case for why the Weather Service Office in Caribou, ME, should be upgraded into a Weather Forecasting Office. We must always work to ensure public safety, and given the enormous land area, a Weather Forecasting Office would be a tremendous benefit for the people of northern Maine. 
You have my assurance, Senator Collins, that when the subcommittee receives the National Weather Service report and recommendations on a reorganization plan, the subcommittee will work closely with you regarding the Caribou, ME, Weather Service Office.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for bringing this project to my attention. I agree that many small businesses do not have adequate access to information on building an export market for their goods. A demonstration of the importance of this assistance by the Vermont World Trade Office would benefit other States considering a similar system. I urge the SBA to consider providing the Vermont World Trade Office with $150,000 to conduct such a demonstration.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be joining with my colleague from Illinois today in this amendment to correct what is an obvious inconsistency, to put it in conservative terms, in American public policy. 
I think there is a general consensus now in this Nation that the use of tobacco is unfortunate, that we wish to discourage its use, especially amongst young people, and that as a government we are trying desperately to inform people of the harm of tobacco to their health and the addictive nature of tobacco and the fact that there is very little positive that comes from smoking tobacco. 
We have had innumerable Surgeon Generals, including the great Surgeon General Dr. Koop, point out this problem as a matter of Federal public policy. We now have a commitment by this administration, and I believe by this Congress, to try to change the manner in which tobacco is marketed in this country, especially to the young people, so that we can lessen the impact of this harmful addiction on America and especially on our young. 
Yet at the same time that we are doing this, at the same time that as a matter of Federal policy, as presented by the Surgeon General, as presented by the Congress, as presented by the administration, at the same time that we are pointing out as a matter of Federal policy that the use of tobacco is harmful and bad and it has a deleterious effect on health and a very dramatically negative impact on the financial situation of this Nation because of its costs in the area of health costs, at that same time we are subsidizing the capacity of the product to be grown. It makes no sense at all. 
This amendment will save $34 million, but it is hardly the money that is important here. It is the statement of public policy that is important. The fact is that, if this Government is going to subsidize the growing of tobacco at the same time it is claiming tobacco is a scourge on the health of this country, we are sending two messages which are totally inconsistent and inappropriate. 
Now, the insurance program, as it is presently structured, is a program which basically puts the grower of tobacco in a unique position, the position where essentially there is a no-loss situation where the Federal Government comes in and assures that the grower, whether tobacco grows or not, whether tobacco is brought to market or not, is able to recover the value of the tobacco. 
This type of a fail-safe situation makes little sense for any commodity, but it certainly does not make any sense for a commodity which has already been declared a detriment to the health of America and especially to the health of children. 
More importantly, it is not needed. It is not even needed. 
Tobacco is a very lucrative crop. In fact, compared to other crops, tobacco is dramatically more profitable than other crops. I have a chart which reflects that fact, which I will not subject you to because this floor gets enough charts, but essentially tobacco crops as a cash crop per acre generate approximately $3,700, whereas wheat, for example, on a per acre basis generates about $134 and corn on a per acre basis represents about $322. So tobacco is generating 10 times the value of corn and many times the value of wheat. 
It hardly seems a crop which is so lucrative would need to have a Federal insurance program to guarantee it, but we do have that program, and that program costs about $34 million a year. Thus, this amendment, which will put an end to that type of an insurance program, which is, first, not needed because the crop itself is viable on its own, regrettably, but it is viable on its own at such high value that it should not be protected by this type of insurance program; but, second, an insurance program which flies in the face of the public policy of the Government generally, especially public policy as stated by the Surgeon General, the President, and this administration, that that type of program should be ended. 
So this amendment ends it. It is about time we did that. It is certainly consistent with the direction which this Congress is moving and this Government is moving and the American people are moving relative to the use of tobacco and the harm that it is causing in the area of health in this country. 
I congratulate the Senator from Illinois for bringing forward this amendment. I am happy to join him in it, and I hope that the Members of the Senate will support it. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

Most of the money paid to Rockingham County came only after a meeting this past March 3, which I hosted in my office with officials from FEMA and Rockingham County Commissioner Tom Battles. At that meeting, we were encouraged by FEMA that the outstanding balance would be settled within the next few months after some more flood mapping was conducted. With adequate time having passed and a new fiscal year on the way, it is only fair to Rockingham County and the State of New Hampshire that this issue be settled as budgets have to be structured.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise on a matter that is not related specifically to this bill, although it has to do with the issue of national defense and technology, and that is the issue of our probe which is now on the planet Mars. What an exceptional thing it is, as we watch the TV pictures come back as they analyze the rocks of Mars and determine that this planet is a fascinating place. We set history and we can investigate the universe. 
All of this is possible because of a product made in New Hampshire. I wanted to congratulate the Warwick Mills of New Ipswich, NH, a small company started in 1888. NASA decided they wanted to land this probe on Mars, and they had to go to the Warwick Mills to be able to do it. It is one of the few places in this world that still weaves in the old-fashioned way. They were able to put together this fabric. This is a picture of the probe on Mars and the fabric that allowed the probe to set down on Mars without being damaged, and it allows it now to wander around the planet Mars and learn about the history of that extraordinary planet and to further the knowledge of man dramatically. 
So from a little mill in New Ipswich, NH, started in 1888, 
using old-fashioned weaving machines, we sent the material to Mars. So on behalf of the State of New Hampshire, I congratulate this little firm that is doing such an extraordinary job to advance the knowledge of America and the world. 
I yield back my time.

Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Delaware. I wish to join with the many Members of this Senate who have congratulated the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from New York for bringing forward this bipartisan initiative, which is really rather extraordinary when you think about it. It is obviously an outgrowth of the fact that the President and the leadership of the Congress have gotten together on how to balance the budget and give a tax cut to working Americans. 
This bill is a product of that initial agreement which occurred in May. The fact it came out with almost unanimous support out of the Finance Committee is something that we should take very seriously as a Congress and especially as a people, in recognition of the fact that this is a bipartisan initiative. 
Now the leader of the Democratic Party has come forward, even though a large--well, the entire Finance Committee membership of the Democrat Party voted for the underlying bill--the leader of the Democrat Party has come forward with a proposal as an alternative. I think a couple of comments need to be made about the specifics of that because it has some problems in the way it handles children and families with children. 
To begin with, it is a phased-in child credit. So, under Senator Daschle's proposal, it is not until the year 2000 that families get the $500 credit. In fact, if you have a child who is over the age of 12, you do not get any credit, any credit at all until the year 2002. 
Well, the practical effect of that is that there are going to be a lot of kids who outgrow the credit; the kids grow up; they get older. The credit will not be available. The families will not have a credit between now and the year 2000 if their children are under 12. It will be a phased-in credit. And if their children are over 12, they won't get it until 2002. If you have a child who happens to be a 12-year-old today, you are never going to get this credit under the--not the Democrat proposal, because the Democrats are supporting the underlying bill--under the Daschle proposal. 
It is pretty outrageous, really, to claim that that bill is more effective in addressing kids than the bipartisan proposal when it does not even cover kids. It does not even cover kids who are over 12 years old until the year 2002. 
Equally significant is the practical effect of the way that they recover the credit from working families. Under the Daschle proposal, the effective tax rate of families earning between $70,000 and $80,000 that have a number of kids in the family would be 58 percent not counting the FICA tax. So the actual tax rate under the Daschle bill is 73 percent--73 percent for those folks in that income bracket. 
Now, there are a lot of working Americans today who have a fair number of kids who have to have both parents work to support them. And, in fact, unfortunately, one of the facts of America today is that many parents have to work simply to pay taxes. One of the spouses works full-time simply to pay the taxes on the family and the other spouse works to try to take care of the family. One is working to take care of the Government; the other one is working to take care of the family. 
If you have a number of kids and you are getting hit with a 73-percent tax rate, even though you may have a fairly high income with a fair number of kids, that tax rate essentially wipes out your income, wipes out not only the income of the spouse working for the Government, but it does a pretty good job on that spouse who is out there trying to earn for the family.

Mr. GREGG. When we were coming up through the ranks, if you had seven to eight kids, which is a lot of kids, you would need an income probably of $70,000 to $80,000. Both parents would have to be working to maintain those families. In that bracket, you would be paying an effective rate of 58 percent on your income tax. And another FICA tax on top of that works out to be an effective rate of 73 percent on the additional earnings.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, just to recap where we are, basically, the Senator from Arkansas has authored an amendment to end the ability to take the depletion allowance for mining companies for that part of their mining activity which occurs on public land. 
Now, let's understand the facts here. A mining company comes along and it buys the right to mine on public land for the value of, I think, $2.50 an acre. For example, in 1995, ASARCO bought 349 acres for $1,745, which had 3 billion dollars' worth of assets on it. Public land, public land. And then a Danish company came along, and for $275 bought 110 acres, which had 1 billion dollars' worth of assets on it. Then a Canadian company came along and spent $9,000 for 1,800 acres which had 11 billion dollars' worth of assets on it. 
That, in and of itself, is a bit of an affront to the American taxpayer. That is not what we are debating here. We are debating an even greater affront--an even greater affront--because after they bought this land for $2.50 an acre, they then go out and take a depletion allowance against that land. Now, it is not against the equipment they are using to mine the land. They can deduct that. They have a right to do that. No, it is a depletion allowance against land which is publicly owned, taxpayers' land. It is not their land. It is taxpayers' land which they bought for $2.50 an acre, and now they get to take a depletion allowance which costs $400 million over the next 5 years. 
Excuse me, what dinner party am I at? Is the Mad Hatter here? Is the Queen of Hearts here? What is this? We have the taxpayers first subsidizing an $11 billion, a $1 billion, and a $3 billion asset purchase which flows to these companies, and then we have the taxpayers subsidizing a depletion allowance which flows to these mining companies. And what does the taxpayer get back for all of this? $2.50 an acre. It is corporate welfare, corporate pork. The term can be applied at a variety of different levels. 
What it is, is wrong. It is wrong that the depletion allowance should be available for land which is public land that is purchased at these outrageously low prices. It doubles up the insult. It doubles up the insult to the American taxpayer. 
I strongly support the initiative of the Senator from Arkansas. I cannot understand how anyone who would believe that the American taxpayer deserves some modicum of respect would not also support this proposal. It simply is an attempt to try to correct just a small sliver of what is a very significant and inappropriate affront to the American taxpayer. It is costing us a lot of money, money that we should not have to pay. 
I heard somebody say, well, this is a tax increase. My goodness, how could you argue that? A tax increase? What we are doing is hammering the taxpayers, expecting the American taxpayer to pick up a depletion allowance on top of having already picked up a loss for having sold this property at a ridiculously low price in light of what the value of the asset being conveyed is. It is not a tax increase. What it is is an attack on the taxpayer. It should not occur any longer. 
The Senator from Arkansas is right in his amendment. I am 
happy to join him. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am not sure who rises in opposition to this amendment. I understand there are some concerns that have been raised. Let me review the amendment so people understand what it does. 
Essentially, this amendment creates a marketplace, creates competition, and it gives seniors the opportunity to go into the marketplace, be thoughtful purchasers, and the result of being thoughtful purchasers is getting an actual return, a monetary return, for being thoughtful purchasers. 
What the amendment does is strike the language in the bill which says that there can be no cash incentives tied to any sort of Choice plan. Now, in the original bill as it was presented by myself, the original Choice bill, the vast majority of which has been incorporated in this bill, we had a section which said that if a senior was able to purchase a plan at less dollars, then the senior would be allowed to keep 75 percent of the savings, and 25 percent of the savings would go into the part A trust fund. Under the bill as it is presently structured, the practical effect was it created more marketplace forces. It meant seniors would be more thoughtful purchasers of health care. This is important. 
Second, it meant that the health care provider groups like HMO's, PPO's and the PSO's who are now being empowered to compete for senior dollars, those groups would have a reason to deliver the same benefit structure as Medicare gives today at the same quality but deliver it at less cost. It is called capitalism. It is called a marketplace force. It is what we are trying to put in place to try to control the cost of health care and Medicare, and it is what is working in the private sector. 
Under the bill as it is presently structured, that opportunity would be eliminated. Now, we are not suggesting that opportunity has to be pursued. We are just saying let's leave open that opportunity under HCFA's guidance, and by the way, if it was determined this might be a way to create better competition and better health care delivery, it would be available. 
Now, I cannot speak for the opposition, but what I have heard from the opposition is that there is a feeling that this cash rebate may in some way affect the Treasury. Well, it does not. Under the present law as it is structured in this bill, if there is no cash rebate, the only beneficiaries of more efficiency are the provider groups. They get to keep the money. They get to keep the money. They do not rebate it to the seniors. They get to keep it, to quote Jerry McGuire. 
Then I heard another comment, `Basically what we want to do is encourage the provider groups to supply more benefits, not to supply a financial rebate to senior citizens.' I think that makes sense. I think that should be an option. I think provider groups like PPO's that can deliver the services for less might want to throw in eyeglass care, might want to throw in prescription care. I think it is a good public policy decision to encourage that. But at the same time I bet you there are some provider groups today, because we pay so much in insurance for Medicare, who could pay the cost of eyeglass care and some percentage of prescription drug care and still be delivering that service for considerably less than what the basic premium is today that we pay in Medicare. Who is going to keep that difference? The provider groups. They will keep it in profit. 
Now, I do find it ironic that people would oppose the concept that we want to open it up to competition in a way that allows the senior citizen to benefit from the cost savings, by putting some pressure on those provider groups to have to say, `We are going to make $100 extra on this contract. Maybe we better return $50 to the senior citizen because, if we do not, our competitor down the street will make that $100 and they will return that $50 and they will get this client.' 
Right now this is an issue. I understand there are some undercurrents of opposition to this. I am appreciative of that. The fact is that this is an attempt to open the marketplace to more competition and create more cost-conscious purchasers and buyers, and as a result I think it is a good approach. It does not demand that that occur. It does not even allow that to occur in the first instance. It simply makes that additional avenue of competition available by giving HCFA the authority to do it rather than banning HCFA from having the authority to do it. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from New Jersey, but they are inaccurate. This does not create a two-tier system. 
Under the law, the basic benefits package of the Medicare system has to be supplied by all providers. Therefore, any provider that comes forward and produces a less costly system is going to be producing a system that still meets the basic benefits package of the Medicare system. The added benefits might be eyeglasses or prescription drugs, but those are benefits which are not presently covered by Medicare anyway. So there is no opportunity for a two-tiered system. 
What the Senator from New Jersey said that was accurate is that efficient suppliers of health care will end up creating a savings. What I am pointing out is that savings then flows to the supplier of the health care, the HMO or the PPO. You are basically underwriting the big health care companies at the disadvantage of seniors because seniors get none of that savings unless there is a benefit added that they may not want. They may not want eyeglasses. They may not want prescription drugs. They may have that under another system. Why not make this option available? 
However, I have been asked by the chairman of the committee to withdraw the amendment at this time. I have great respect for the chairman of the committee and will acquiesce to his request. I understand his concern. I believe this is bad policy as it is presently structured. It is not in the House bill, and I hope it will be straightened out in Congress because I think we ought to give seniors this chance. 
I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the yeas and nays and withdraw the amendment.

Mr. GREGG. So if you follow the logic of the Senator from Massachusetts, you are saying John and Mary Jones, the wage earner of America, should be subsidizing the person who is earning $100,000, that would be the practical effect of adopting Senator Kennedy's amendment.

Mr. GREGG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. President, listening to this argument here, it seems to me that it is extraordinarily disjointed coming from the other side. 
Let's remember what we are talking about. We are talking about people who are making $75,000 or $100,000 a year being supported in their health care under part B by people who are making $25,000 a year, $30,000 a year, or $40,000 a year. People who are working on a line job in New Hampshire, at a restaurant in Texas, and at a garage in New Mexico are supporting people who are retired who are making $75,000 to $100,000. And what is the complaint from the other side? The complaint from the other side is that somebody who makes $100,000 might have to pay 2 percent of their income in their retirement years to buy part B insurance--2 percent. You tell me where you can go out and spend as a senior citizen in the private sector 2 percent of your income and buy a health care plan that is going to cover you for physician costs. You can't do it. 
The statement was made from the other side that somehow these extremely wealthy people have been paying into the system more; and, they paid in more and, therefore, they should get some sort of extraordinary benefit as a result of that where 
they are subsidized by people earning $25,000 to $30,000 a year. That is simply not true. They may have paid more into part A, yes. But they have not paid more into part B. Part B is on a cash basis system. It is a pay-as-you-go system. You buy that insurance on an annual basis. The people who pay more for part B happen to be the poor men and women who are working in America who are paying payroll taxes, and who are paying into the general fund and then have to subsidize to the extent of 75 percent the person who is making $100,000. That is the person who is paying more--the wage earner. The concept that high-income individuals should not have to pay the full cost of the health care benefit which they are receiving, the insurance benefit they are receiving, makes no sense at all. It makes no sense that someone who is making $100,000 shouldn't have to bear the full cost of the part B premium. 
We heard earlier today that the other side was surprised that people are living longer, and that is why they don't want to move too quickly into the issue of whether or not we should raise the retirement age. We heard earlier today from the other side that people were, I guess, surprised that the part A trust fund is going broke. That is why they don't want to move too quickly into the issue of whether or not people should have their age of retirement raised. 
I can't believe, recognizing the speakers from the other side who have been carrying the water on this issue, that they are surprised that there are rich people in America, and that is what this is about. There are rich people in America, and they are not paying their fair share.

Mr. GREGG. First, I rise to congratulate the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from New Jersey, the chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee, for getting us to this point where we are in the process of voting on and hopefully reaching a conclusion on two very important reconciliation bills which deal with the critical elements of how we manage entitlement spending and how we manage tax policy here at the Federal level, and which lead, hopefully, to a conclusion that we can say with certainty that the balanced budget agreement which was reached has been met and that we will therefore have a balanced budget which our children can look to as a benefit and which we can look to as a success. 
I want to speak specifically about two elements of the reconciliation bill which I consider to be important, two different bills, the one that deals with the spending, the entitlement bill, and the one that deals with tax policy, and talk about the Medicare Choice Program, reform program, and the pension language within these two bills, because I think these bills have made giant strides in both these areas toward addressing some fundamental public policy needs. 
I commend Senator Roth and the Finance Committee for including these important provisions on both Medicare and on pension reform. 
Earlier this year I introduced S. 246, the Choice care bill. It was essentially similar to legislation that I had introduced in the last Congress, which was included in the Balanced Budget Act that year, which unfortunately was vetoed by the President. The Medicare savings achieved in this reconciliation bill represent only a tentative start, however, toward placing the Medicare system on a path toward long-term solvency. But they are an important start. 
There are still trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liability awaiting us, and this legislation does not address it all, but it does get us off on the right foot. 
I am pleased we have taken this opportunity to enact some of the structural reforms that are key to real substantive Medicare reform and the stabilization of the Medicare trust funds. In my Choice care bill and in the provisions contained in this legislation, seniors will be able to choose from a large variety of health care purchasing options. They can remain in their traditional Medicare plan, they could instead buy an HMO, or they could buy from a competing medical plan provided that it meets the benefit standards of the present Medicare system. So seniors will have a wide variety of new and exciting choices. 
When we offer seniors this great array of choices, we benefit not only the seniors but the system as a whole by bringing it into the marketplace. Traditional Medicare must then effectively compete for the right for seniors' health care spending in the marketplace and the people in the marketplace who are willing to give other options to seniors. Suppose, for example, there are plans that can deliver services more effectively and more efficiently than Medicare in a particular region of this Nation. If they can do that, then they can offer a more substantial package of benefits for the same costs, and, therefore, seniors will have an incentive to buy from these plans. 
Take, for example, if a plan was able to offer the seniors not only the basic Medicare benefit but also maybe an eyeglass benefit or a prescription drug benefit. That option is now going to be available to the seniors. This benefits the health of the system because, at the same time, this legislation gains control over the rate of growth of the per capita spending in the Medicare Program. So whenever seniors move into these plans that can offer them a better benefits package, the entire system will save money because the Medicare system will be spending less money per capita on these seniors than it would under the traditional Medicare system. 
If they are getting a stronger package, you might say, how can that be? It is called the marketplace, it is called capitalism, it is called what is happening in the private sector today, in the health care system generally. But, unfortunately, it is not helping Medicare, which was designed for a 1960's health care delivery system, which simply is not operable in the 1990's or as we go into the year 2000. 
This legislation begins to flatten the wide disparity in reimbursement levels that exist between geographic regions in this country by gradually blending over time local and national reimbursement rates. If we do this, then we make spending patterns in Medicare more fair and reward those regions of the country that have already done well in holding down costs. The disparity between regions is really excessive. For example, in some parts of this country, like New Hampshire and Oregon, and I suspect in Wyoming, where the Presiding Officer is from, the costs of Medicare benefits are significantly lower than in areas like Staten Island. In fact, it is lower by almost $500 a month. 
It is imperative we include such reform as a component of the Medicare Choice Program because only by doing so can we be sure that seniors in low-cost areas will ultimately have access to a wide array of benefit packages. As long as reimbursement rates in some parts of the country are unfairly low, it will be difficult to entice plans into those regions to compete for seniors' dollars even though the health care benefits in those areas today are being maintained at a high level. 
I believe we should have increased the incentives available to seniors to become cost conscious by offering them opportunities to save money in the manner in which they buy Medicare. That is the incentive that truly moves shoppers, and I believe that Medicare Choice would be a greatly strengthened reform if we had included a cash-rebate incentive. Under my original bill, S. 246, every time a senior bought from a less expensive plan, even though the benefit package in that plan had to meet the same benefit package or exceed the benefit package of the present Medicare system, if the plan costs less because of competition and efficiencies within that plan, then 75 percent of the savings would have gone to the individual, and the remaining 25 percent would have been deposited in the trust fund. Thus, the trust fund would never lose money due to such rebates. 
On the contrary, the trust fund would receive money every time a senior sees this incentive to make a cost-conscious decision. Unfortunately, this language was left out of this bill, and, in fact, there is some language in this bill which undermines the ability to create incentives in the Medicare system under the Medicare Choice plan. I expect I will be offering an amendment to correct this, an amendment to strike that section which limits the ability to offer incentives, because lacking that important incentive we cannot, in my opinion, create the huge marketplace forces which we need in order to significantly control the costs of health care and to create marketplace forces within the health care systems. 
Even considering that, this package still offers the incentive to seniors that where their plan can be more efficient, they will be offered an enhanced package of benefits. That is a significant incentive. While perhaps not as powerful a purchasing incentive as an actual cash rebate, for example, it is my hope that the prospect of strengthened benefits will prove a powerful enticement that allows seniors to move more comfortably into buying Medicare Choice plans. 
I am reminded of the old saying that you begin a trip, a long journey, with one small step. Well, this package that has been brought forth by the Finance Committee is a series of small steps. It has gotten us well into the journey. It has not gotten us to the end, but it has gotten us down the road by giving seniors more choices and more opportunities in the way they purchase their health care. 
At the same time that the Finance Committee has made significant strides in the area of Medicare by making Choice care available to them in the Choice care plan which I introduced, it is also contained in the tax resolution which will be coming forward later in the week, a significant incentive to increase retirement savings. I congratulate, again, and thank Senator Roth, the chairman of the Finance Committee, for including so many of the ideas and initiatives which I was able to participate in pulling together as chairman of the Retirement Task Force. I also want to particularly thank Senator Bob Graham and other members of the bipartisan working group for their aggressiveness in promoting pension reform which will promote savings. 
Some months ago, I was asked by Majority Leader Trent Lott to chair the Republican task force on retirement security, and in that capacity I worked with Senator Roth and the rest of the task force to develop a package of proposals introduced a week ago as Senate bill S. 883. 
I will not use this time here to describe again the dire circumstances of this Nation with respect to retirement savings. When we introduced S. 883, we detailed the vast gap between our Nation's retirement income and the inadequate amount of funding we are currently putting aside to meet those retirement needs. Approximately $7 trillion of unfunded liability sits in our different retirement accounts. I am very pleased to note that no fewer than 13 of the provisions, 13 of the provisions of S. 883 have been included in some form in this budget reconciliation package. While many of them are small or technical corrections without significant revenue impacts, enacting these reforms will do much to improve the prospects for expanding pension coverage and retirement savings. 
Because time is limited, let me list only a few of the reforms that have come to be included in this package which I think are positive for encouraging people to save for their retirement. 
This budget reconciliation package includes the first title of the WISE bill, S. 260. This part of the WISE bill--the WISE bill being a bill directed at giving more equity to women in the area of being able to save for their retirement--strengthens the homemaker IRA. I, personally, have placed a higher priority on this provision than on any other of our task force savings initiatives, so I am particularly pleased to see it was included. This provision received the active support of a bipartisan group of Senators, including, most notably, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun from the other side of the aisle. 
This provision, Mr. President, will sever the link between the homemaker's ability to make a fully tax deductible contribution to IRA and allow her to make that contribution whether or not her husband or her spouse who is in the workplace has a pension plan. This is an important provision not only because it will stimulate additional savings but because it will enable homemakers, especially women, to generate additional savings in their own name. It is about time we do that. I especially want to congratulate, of course, Senator Roth, the chairman of the Finance Committee, who has been a tireless advocate for this idea. 
This reconciliation bill also will gradually raise the income limits on the tax deductible contributions to IRA's. Our Republican task force endorsed the Roth-Breaux legislation that would have completely phased out the income limits so that every American will be eligible to fully deduct their IRA contributions. I believe that Finance Committee Chairman Roth exerted every effort to achieve as much as he could in this area, and I am pleased he included at least a version of the language from the task force bill, gradually phasing up the income limits, doubling them by the year 2004. This will do a tremendous amount to spur savings in our marketplace and as people head toward retirement. 
This budget reconciliation package also includes the backloaded IRA, an important new option in retirement savings in which the contributions are not tax deductible and the tax advantages come up upon withdrawal. This expands the capacity of individuals to take advantage of retirement incentives in a way that works best for them. It also limits the revenue loss in the short term from IRA expansion, because the contributions 
today will be taxed when they are made. I know many individuals will wish to use this alternative backloaded-IRA structure, and thus this will be an important incentive for additional long-term savings. 
Mr. President, one thing we must do as a nation is simply make it easier and more convenient for people to save. The fact is that if we do not do this, we as a nation are going to face bankruptcy as a result of the costs of our pension systems as the postwar baby-boom generation fully retires in the year 2010 and beyond. One reason why the thrift savings plan worked so well for Federal employees is that it has the feature of automatic deduction from one's payroll, automatic investment, automatic savings. I am pleased that the Finance Committee has also included the provision to allow for automatic payroll deductions into IRA accounts. This will also stimulate additional retirement savings simply by making IRA investment easier. 
I am also pleased this reconciliation package recognizes we must continue to do more to stimulate retirement savings not only through individual savings but also through employer-provided pensions. I have long been troubled by the limitations that have been placed on employer funding of future pension liabilities. Employers must fund these liabilities sooner or later, and it is good policy to put more of the funding upfront to allow that funding to be invested and to use the compounding interest to increase the investment and to assure an adequate amount of funds when people retire. 
The reconciliation package picks up most of the provisions authored by the task force to raise the limits on full funding by 5 percent every 2 years. I believe that our Nation's workers will be more secure by their pension benefits being funded more fully. This is a critical point because so many of our pension benefits are underfunded. The capacity of the employer to be able to fully fund the pension benefits at an earlier time in the cycle is critical to assure people will have a pension when they retire. 
Some of the technical changes made by this bill are very significant. This reconciliation bill would exempt State and local government plans from the cumbersome nondiscrimination rules. This was a prime example of how many of our pension laws and regulations have been unduly complicated. Nondiscrimination rules were not created to apply to Government plans, where it is difficult to find exactly who the employer is and thus to compare employer and employee benefits. This type of commonsense change will make it easier for States and local governments to plan for functions around the country. 
Another task force-endorsed reform picked up by the reconciliation bill will do much to help small business. Until now, the matching contributions made by the self-employed were treated differently under tax law than the matching contributions made by employers. By straightening out the discrepancy, we will remove another obstacle from among the many that deter small business owners from providing pension coverage. As we all know, small business is where we most need to increase participation in pension plans. 
There is not time, Mr. President, to discuss every reform that was inserted into this reconciliation bill in the pension area. But I am pleased that this bill draws from reform initiatives in a variety of areas. In the area of portability--I am talking now about the tax bill coming to us after we complete the bill on spending--this bill will add extra protection to defined benefit plans that accept rollovers, protecting them from disqualification if they do facilitate that kind of portability. Moreover, the bill includes a few provisions that will streamline the paperwork process. The bill will facilitate the use of new technologies to replace old paperwork filing, and also eliminate some paperwork requirements that should no longer be required. Finally, various technical inconsistencies within the law will be eliminated if we retain those provisions in conference. 
Let me close by thanking Chairman Roth for his extraordinary effort and for his willingness to include so many provisions to promote pension reform and Medicare Choice in both reconciliation bills, as well as several other Finance Committee Senators, including Senators Bob Graham, Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch, Jim Jeffords, and others. Although I am not on the Finance Committee, I was certainly pleased to be able to work with this group to advance efforts to increase retirement savings. Savings incentives are an effective and important use of tax relief--one of the very best things that we can do with our opportunity this year to relieve the tax burden on American taxpayers. I do hope and expect that we can retain these critical provisions in these two bills. 
Now let me express one area that I have concern about, and that is the area of how we handle the Medicaid expansion, or the new program for the purposes of assisting child health. I have read the bill. I understand that States have the right to choose between a capped grants program and the expansion of the Medicaid Program. It is not, however, clear to me what the requirements are relative to coverage, and how demanding the Federal Government is going to be on each State as to how and what must be covered on each child. I would have serious reservations if we have created a new entitlement program. This would be a mistake, at a time when we are trying to control the rate of growth of the Federal Government and growth of the most explosive side of the Federal Government, the entitlement accounts of this Government; it would be a serious error for us to embark on a new entitlement program. 
It is not clear to me, after having read this, whether or not we have done that. It is clear to me that there was an intention not to do that. At least, in the language of the bill, and in the explanation of the bill, statements were made that it was not the intention of the committee to move down the road of a new entitlement program. Whether or not the operable language in fact creates such an event, demanding that certain action be taken, that certain expenditures be made and not funding those, or creating a situation where people can come in and demand those expenditures in a way that creates an entitlement or a mandatory program is not absolutely clear. As we go forward with this debate, I hope we will get clarification on this point. Should it turn out that this is a new entitlement program, I hope we will change that, either here on the floor or in conference, so that the intent of the language is clear, which is to create a grant program to benefit children and their health needs. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is my intention to shortly offer an amendment which is technical in nature but goes to one of the philosophies of the Choice care issue. The Choice care, as presented in this bill which is an excellent step forward in trying to make the Medicare system more viable, efficient, and most importantly more effective for our senior citizens, is a concept where seniors are going to be given an opportunity to go out in the marketplace and choose between the variety of different care providers. 
Today under the Medicare system, basically seniors are limited to the traditional Medicare and to a very limited HMO option. The traditional Medicare, of course, is a 1960's program designed to meet a 1950's medical system structure. It is not current or effective for today. It is a cost-plus system, for all intents and purposes. It is extraordinarily inefficient, and it does not allow very much flexibility in the marketplace. 
The pre-Medicare system, as is structured today for the delivery of its different options to seniors, is like driving a 1961 Chevrolet down a highway in 1997 with the understanding that you are going to have to go into the year 2000 still driving a 1961 car. Everything on the car has been replaced. Very little of it works. It is blowing out a lot of smoke. It is chugging along at 45 miles an hour top speed. It simply isn't working correctly. 
So, in order to try to redress that, the committee has put in place a very creative initiative in the area of Choice care, which essentially says that seniors are now going to have the ability to go out in the marketplace and choose between a variety of different health care providers. That variety of health care providers could involve an HMO. It could involve a PPO where a group of physicians get together. It can be called a PSO, again, a group of physicians getting together. Or it could involve some new way, I suspect, where hospital and doctors and somebody else designs a new way of delivering services. But the services they deliver must equal the benefits package which is presently under the Medicare system. 
So seniors lose nothing in the definition of the size or nature of their benefits package. And it must equal the benefits package in the area of quality so that seniors lose nothing in the area of quality of their health care. 
What they get is a marketplace which will come forward and compete for the seniors' health care. What does that do? Well, as we have seen in the private sector, that will give the seniors a whole new variety of choices, a whole new panoply of choices, from which to choose the health care provider group that they want to give them Medicare. 
They may get options coming at them which say, `Here, we are going to give you the basic Medicare package, but we are going to also throw in eyeglass care. We are also going to throw in pharmaceutical care. It is not going to cost you any more, but we will put that in to try to attract you to our supplier of health care, to our HMO, to our PPO.' 
So seniors are going to get more choices. Under this benefits structure, as put forward in the reconciliation bill, new benefits can be added on top of the benefits that are supplied by the basic Medicare plan. That is a given. That is an incentive that can be put in. But what is not allowed under this package, or what is specifically disallowed, is the concept that a senior could pay less for the same benefit package. 
You have to remember here that what you are dealing with is the market system. So it is more than likely--in fact, it is expected--that a variety of health care providers, as a result of being efficient, as a result of cost-saving structures which they put in place, are going to be able to supply the health care basic benefits structure of the Medicare system to a senior citizen for less than what it costs today. 
For example, we pay out $4,800 a year for health care benefit. Insurance pays about $4,800 a year for insurance for seniors. That is a very high price, by the way. It is very likely that you are going to see provider groups come forward at $4,300 a year. There is going to be a $500 saving in that provider group. 
Under this bill, the way the provider group adjusts for that is they must put more benefits into the package. That is the only option they have. They have to put in eyeglasses. They have to put in drug benefits. That is a reasonable approach. Yes; to give the senior more options at the same price for more health care types of health care. But another option, of course, would be let's sell it to the senior for less. That is probably going to happen, too. You are going to probably see some health care providers give the same package of options but be able to give it at less than $4,800. Under this bill as it is presently structured, if that were to occur, the health care provider would get all the savings. There would not be any incentive for the health care provider to turn some of that savings back to the Government or back to the senior citizen. 
In the original Choice care plan that I drafted--I do not say this to try to be too expansive about my own efforts--I believe was essentially one of the cores from which this plan was put together, which is in the reconciliation bill. In my original health care plan, I had language which said, if a senior is able to purchase their health care--the same package, the same benefit structure--from a health care provider, that health care provider cannot use that for selection. They cannot try to pick and choose seniors. It must take all comers. If a senior is able to find a health care provider who is willing to charge less--and the quality must be maintained under the standards we have here--then the senior, rather than having only the option of getting more benefits, would also have the option of getting a return on the lower cost premium. 
So, if you paid $4,800 for seniors' health care but you could purchase health care at say $4,300, there would be a $500 savings annually. We would take that $500 savings. And the health care provider could as an option, rather than buying eyeglass care for the senior or buying health prescription drugs for a senior, could say to the senior, `We are going to turn that $500 back to you.' If the health care provider decided to do that, then the senior, under my original bill, would get to keep 75 percent of that and 25 percent goes back to the Federal Treasury. 
That was the plan of the original bill. 
This language of this bill says a Medicare Choice organization is not authorized to provide cash or other monetary repayments as an inducement for enrollment. That makes it impossible for an incentive system to be put in place. Markets work on incentives, not only benefit incentives but money incentives. 
Thus, I believe that subject to the limitations of what HCFA will put on the provider, subject to the limitations that it has to be a quality system, subject to the limitations that it has to be a system which meets a health care insurance plan that meets the basic Medicare requirements of what must be covered, subject to the fact there cannot be adverse selection, there is no disincentive, no downside to creating a marketplace in force beyond added benefits of added cash, of the potential of refunding cash. 
So, basically, I think this language is counterproductive to the basic goal of Choice care, which is to create market forces not only on behalf of the provider groups but within the senior community to go out and be cost-conscious purchasers. The whole idea of Choice care is to give seniors more options to choose from and create a more efficient marketplace, which will in turn create a lower cost of health care for the basic benefits package of Medicare, or at least slow the rate of growth of the cost of that health care package. 
That is the whole concept of Choice care. But if you take out of Choice care any financial incentive to save, if you say to seniors: Your only incentive to purchase another plan may be additional benefits, which they may not need, then you have reduced dramatically the marketplace forces. If you take out of the system any incentive for the provider group to rebate those savings, then you have created an atmosphere where provider groups may generate savings, but they will keep them themselves. In that way, I think you skew the marketplace because in an open market when somebody is able to sell a product for less, they pass the benefit of that lower cost on to the consumer, and that is what we are trying to do in the language of the original bill--pass the benefit of the lower cost of health care on to the consumer. 
So in order to address that, without putting in place the incentive system that I design in my bill--we are not suggesting that that incentive system should go in as I designed it. We are just suggesting there should be the opportunity for HCFA and for the regulatory agencies to be able to look at incentive systems and not be barred from looking at incentive systems, cash incentive systems, monetary incentive systems. In order to allow that to occur, we need to remove this language. In order to make this Choice care more effective, a potentially more dynamic force to create more of a marketplace event where seniors are actually out there thinking, hey, I intend to look around and see how much I can buy insurance for, and one of the reasons I am looking around is while I might get better benefits, the second reason I am looking around is I may get it at less cost--in order to create that type of market dynamic, which is absolutely critical if you are going to have Choice care work effectively, you cannot have language which says under no circumstances, even if HCFA were to find that it would work, can you in any way create an incentive system that involves monetary consideration. 
So this language, I believe, is counterproductive to the basic goal of Choice care. I think it should be noted as an aside here also that the concept of Choice care is to make seniors more cost-conscious purchasers, but in doing that you have to remember that, yes, those seniors who are on the system today probably are not going to change. They probably are not going to change their health care system. They have been there. They have been in the system. They came out of the 1950's and 1960's when they had a sole care provider. They are used to less health care. That is the way they are brought up, most of the seniors on the system today. So we are not really targeting the Choice care concept at that group. What we are targeting the Choice care concept at is the next generation of seniors coming into the system, that generation which has already been through the health care explosion of the late 1980's and early 1990's. A variety of health care providers were made available to them, where HMO's became commonplace in the private sector and in the marketplace. These folks are going to be familiar with the concept of a PPO, PSO, or HMO as a provider group, so they are going to be comfortable with going out and shopping around. 
If we create a disincentive for them to do that by saying, well, if you shop around, you do not get any of the benefits of shopping around other than some higher benefit package which you may not want to begin with, then we will be undermining a culture which already exists. We will be saying to people who are coming out of the private sector, having been used to shopping around--maybe they were in a cafeteria program where they actually got a refund of some of the costs of the lower cost health insurance since they purchased it. We are going to be saying to those people, when you get into the public system, it is basically a cost-plus system and you are not going to be able to get any of benefits of the thoughtful purchase of lower priced health care in relationship to your needs or in relationship to a one-size-fits-all package. 
So I do believe that to leave this language in not only undermines one of the options that might make Choice care much more effective, but it undermines the natural, inherent attitude that is going to be coming with this new generation of people who receive funds from Choice care, who participate in Medicare, and who have been brought up in a marketplace where Choice care is the typical type of health care approach.

 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the students of Gorham High School of Gorham, NH, who participated in the `We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution' national finals. I commend these exceptional young people in their impressive performance against 50 other classes from around the Nation. These students demonstrated great knowledge of the principles of American constitutional development. 
The distinguished members of the team representing New Hampshire are: David Arsenault, Jan Bindas-Tenney, Melissa Borowski, Alyssa Breton, Mike Burrill, Kevin Carpenter, Todd Davis, Rebecca Evans, Brad Fillion, Cyndy Gibson, Patrick Gilligan, Sean Griffith, Reid Hartman, Sarah King, Michelle Leveille, Monica McKenzie, Ashley Thompson, Michael Toth, Julie Washburn, Tuuli Winter, and Melanie Wolf. I also would like to recognize their teacher Mike Brosnan, their district coordinator Ray Kneeland, and their state coordinator Holly Belson. These three people dedicated much time and effort to help the team make it to the national finals. 
This competition, which is organized by the Center for Civic Education, attracts over 1,200 students and tests their comprehension of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Also, the students must be able to relate these ideals to contemporary issues before simulated congressional committees composed of constitutional lawyers, journalists, and scholars. The students of Gorham did an exceptional job demonstrating all of these important skills. Their dedication to our Nation's founding ideals is impressive and should serve as an example to any young person who is interested in the U.S. Government and its laws. 
The `We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution' Program provides an excellent educational experience for students. These young people gain extensive knowledge of the Constitution and the active role it plays in all of our lives. I wish the best of luck to the students of Gorham High School in their future endeavors.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from North Carolina and the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Minnesota in endorsing this really excellent effort that has been developed through a great deal of negotiation between the Senators from North Carolina and Delaware, the Secretary of State, the Ambassador to the United Nations, the Senator from Minnesota, and the majority leader. 
This effort was not easy. There were a lot of disagreements as to how we should address the U.N. arrearages issue. I am speaking from the perspective of the Appropriations Committee, where I chair the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the funding of the United Nations. From my viewpoint, I and I think many of my colleagues were not really willing to simply give carte blanche to the United Nations again. 
The fact is that the United Nations has, regrettably, been fiscally mismanaged. That mismanagement has meant that American tax dollars have been wasted. That is not right. We as a Senate have an obligation to make sure that the tax dollars that are sent to us out of the hard earnings of our constituents are effectively spent. This proposal includes in it conditions that will require the United Nations to finally straighten out its fiscal house. Today, you really can't tell where a dollar goes that is sent to the United Nations. More importantly, there is a distinct sense that when a dollar goes to the United Nations today, a great deal is misspent on patronage, on promised services that are not delivered, on programs that don't work, and on agencies which have an excessive amount of personnel. 
So we are requiring, under this proposal, that the United Nations put in very basic accounting procedures, that they actually be able to tell us where the dollars go, that they have a personnel policy that is accountable, a system of accounting for the programmatic activity they undertake. 
More importantly, we are requiring and putting in conditions that allow us to determine that their procedures and structures work well, from a GAO auditing of their procedures. 
In addition, we have seen the other conditions outlined by the Senator from Delaware and, I am sure, will be outlined by other Senators here, which will make the United Nations fee system, or payment system, or dues system more reflective of the burdens of other nations, as well as the United States. We pay a disproportionate amount of the cost for peacekeeping and for the fees at the United Nations and the dues of the United Nations. We are not talking about dramatic reduction in either our commitment to the United Nations, in peacekeeping, or in our commitment to the area of dues. But we are talking about bringing it more in line with the fact that other nations, since the initiation of the United Nations, have risen in their economic capability to bear some of this burden. That is reflective in this amendment. 
So this is a good amendment. It is an amendment that brought together the various parties. And, believe me, when we started the negotiations, we were a long way apart. There wasn't much expectation that an agreement would be reached. But through the good counsel of the Senator from North Carolina, the Senator from Minnesota, the majority leader, and through the hard effort of the Secretary of State and the Ambassador to the United Nations, we have reached an accommodation and agreement. It is a positive one, one that will help the United Nations be a stronger institution that people can have confidence in, especially as to how and where it spends the dollars sent to it. 
So it is a positive step forward to have these conditions in this bill. I, as an appropriator, would have a lot of problems passing any appropriation that didn't follow the outline set forth by this committee and set forth in the work of Senator Helms and Senator Biden. 
I yield the balance of my time.  
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. GREGG. Madam President, today the State of New Hampshire and a number of communities in the State of New Hampshire were afforded a singular and appropriate honor. The city of Nashua, my hometown, where I was born, raised, and went to school, was rated the best place in America in which to live. The city of Manchester and the city of Portsmouth were rated the sixth and fifth best places in the country in which to live. That means the State of New Hampshire, which is a small State--and to paraphrase Daniel Webster, a small State but there are those of us who love it--received the designation of having three of its major communities within the State identified as the best places to live of the top 10 in the country. In fact, only one other State, Florida, was able to put three communities in the top 10. And, of course, Florida is about 6 or 7 times the size of New Hampshire in population. 
In addition, no other State was able to put two of its communities in the top five, and New Hampshire has the first community and the fifth community in Nashua and Portsmouth. Those of us who live in New Hampshire and have enjoyed the fruits of being part of that wonderful community, understand that this is not an award which is received as a result of luck, but it is an award which is received as a result of a lot of hard work and, more important, a lot of community spirit. We are a State where people still care about their neighbors. We are a State where we care about how we deal with each other. And, as a result, we have built communities where crime is low, where education is extremely strong, where our health care is rated the best in the country, where our mental health care is rated the best in the country, where we are rated best in the country for caring for troubled children, and where we still maintain a State which has no sales or income tax and delivers effective and efficient and first-class community services to our citizens. 
And our citizens get involved. It is a State of voluntarism, a State where people understand if they are going to make their community work well they have to take the time to be involved in the local community activities whether it is the local Babe Ruth League or baseball team, or whether it happens to be the arts community or whether it is just the process of cleaning up the main street on cleanup day. 
So I rise to congratulate my fellow citizens of New Hampshire, to especially congratulate the cities of Manchester, Portsmouth, and Nashua, and with a unique emphasis on Nashua in that it was rated No. 1 and that it is my hometown, where I was born and raised and went to school, and I am very proud that they have done so well. I congratulate all of those who make New Hampshire such a fine place to live.

Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wanted to talk a little bit about the agreement which we are about to reach, it appears, relative to the United Nations and how we are going to pay our arrears. I chair the Committee on Commerce, State, and Justice, which has jurisdiction over the appropriations that go to the United Nations. At the behest of the majority leader, Senator Lott, and at the request of the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, myself and Senator Helms and Senator Grams and our staffs have been meeting assiduously with Ambassador Richardson's staff, and the staff of Secretary Albright. We have made considerable progress. In fact, we believe we have reached an agreement as to how to handle these arrearages. 
The basic theme of this agreement is that we are going to ask the United Nations to be a better place. We are not going to ask them to do things which are unreasonable. We are not going to ask them to do things which are political. We are just going to ask them to do a better job of handling our money. And to assure that, we are going to set certain benchmarks. 
So, we are going to commit to the United Nations; we are basically going to give them what amounts to, in my opinion, an irrevocable letter of credit that we will pay the arrearages as we see them. The number that we agreed on I believe is significant, and I believe it will be agreeable to the people at the United Nations But, in exchange for paying those arrearages--and we are going to do it over a period of time--we are going to ask that the United Nations run a better shop, that it be more efficient, that it use those dollars more efficiently and that it make sure that it handles those dollars the way American taxpayers expect us to handle the dollars that they pay us. Because for every dollar 
spent at the United Nations today, 25 cents comes from the American taxpayer. 
It is very hard today to go back to the people in New Hampshire, my good people who have just been rated so highly as the great place to live by Money magazine--it is very hard to go back to them and say, `Well, we are going to give the United Nations this amount of money for our dues but we are not sure where the money is spent, how it is spent, who it is spent on, or whether, when it is spent, it goes to where they say it is going to go.' 
To try to correct that, we are asking that the United Nations meet certain very definable, enforceable benchmarks. The Senator from Minnesota, who I notice is on the floor, Senator Grams, has been a major player in defining those benchmarks, and of course the Senator from North Carolina, Senator Helms, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has been a force of immense proportions on defining those benchmarks. 
But agreement appears to have been reached, at least between ourselves and the administration. It is an agreement which is fair and which gives the United Nations the dollars which they feel they deserve. But, in exchange for those dollars, it does require that the United Nations be responsible with the management of those dollars and the management of additional dollars that we will be giving them in the foreseeable future. This agreement, I believe, will be included in the foreign relations bill, the authorization bill for foreign affairs, foreign relations, which is going to be coming through--the State Department authorization. It will be marked up later this week. 
I just want to express my appreciation for all the people who worked so hard on this. We worked on it for about, I guess, now, almost 4 months. Fairly aggressive negotiations have occurred. I think it is good we have reached an agreement and it is positive for the process and it will immensely improve the operation of the United Nations, should the United Nations decide to go along with proposals that we have made. I presume they will because they are reasonable proposals. 
Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the introduction of the Claremont Commission Act, which I am introducing, along with Senators Bob Smith, Torricelli, and Johnson. 
We chose this day because it is the anniversary of the historic event that prompted the introduction of this legislation. Two years ago on this very day, a concerned citizen from Newport, NH, Mr. Frank McConnell, stood up at a town meeting in Claremont, NH, and asked an insightful and thought-provoking question of Speaker Gingrich and President Clinton: What are they going to do about reforming our campaign financing system? The two leaders, who were attending the meeting, promised to create a bipartisan commission to study campaign finance reform and then shook hands on the agreement. That handshake was a famous and short-lived moment of solidarity and bipartisanship. At this time, sadly, no such commission has been created. 
The bill that I introduce today is a renewed effort to keep the promise made on that famous day 2 years ago. The Claremont Commission Act was introduced in a bipartisan manner to create an objective commission to look at the issues surrounding the reform of our Nation's campaign finance system. This legislation directs the commission to take important goals into consideration when making recommendations to the Congress with regard to reform legislation. These goals include: limiting the influence of money in Federal elections; increasing voter participation, creating a more equitable electoral system for both challengers and incumbents; and removing the negative aspects of financing of Federal elections. I believe that these are important goals to consider when Congress moves to make actual changes to our campaign financing laws. 
The Claremont Commission Act specifically asks the commission to consider and respond to more than 14 questions regarding the most important issues surrounding the campaign finance reform debate. I am especially pleased that the issues of soft money contributions, independent expenditures, and the role of unions will be addressed. In particular, the role of unions and their use of mandatory union dues to make donations to political campaigns is of concern to me. The commission will address the serious issues surrounding how unions finance their political activities, as well as the considerable influence that these organizations wield over the outcome of elections. I am pleased that the creation of this commission can begin to address concerns, as well as other Members of Congress' questions regarding soft money contributions and independent expenditures. 
The political infighting that has occurred over the years regarding the financing of our Federal elections will not cease unless a middle ground can be established. I believe that the Claremont Commission Act, by establishing a mechanism for a dispassionate analysis by a group of experts, can provide that middle ground. Hopefully, this bill will allow us to address the concerns of all Americans who have a growing sense of cynicism over our ability to resolve important campaign financing problems. 
In closing, I urge my colleagues to take a serious look at this legislation and consider the merits of commissioning a bipartisan recommendation regarding campaign finance reform.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to rise to introduce the Retirement Income, Security, and Savings Act of 1997. 
Mr. President, this bill represents the culmination of literally months of work by the Republican Retirement Security Task Force, which I chair. It embodies a collection of policies which would, if enacted, do a tremendous amount for a critical national need--to increase retirement saving and ultimately, therefore, retirement income for all Americans. 
It has become almost axiomatic to state that America is in dire need of a qualitative increase in its level of retirement saving. None of the three legs of the metaphorical retirement stool--Social Security, employer-provided pensions, and individual saving--are saving an adequate amount for 21st century retirement needs. Social Security is not really a savings program at all, but is rather funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, the surplus loaned to the Government, to be paid back from general revenues at a future date. Employer-provided pensions only reach half of the working population, and there are problems of underfunding facing even the portion that are covered. And, as a general rule, only a few Americans are putting away sufficient saving on their own initiative to meet their future retirement income needs. 
I would like to take a few moments to describe the current details with respect to retirement income in America, and then how our package addresses those needs. Only then, I believe, can my colleagues fully appreciate the quality and importance of the policy recommendations that we are making. 
The typical retired American today receives retirement income from a variety of sources. On average, 41.7 percent comes from Social Security, 20.5 percent from asset income, 20.1 percent from pensions, 14.8 percent is annually earned, and the remaining 3 percent comes from a variety of other sources, including welfare programs such as SSI and unemployment compensation. 
I would stress that this is only an average picture. The reality varies 
greatly from American to American. We need to look at the oldest of Americans to see the future of an aging nation. Americans currently 80 and older receive 52.6 percent of their income from Social Security, whereas their pensions provide proportionally less--down to 15.3 percent. And, of course, they are less able to earn money at this age, thus earnings make up only 3.9 percent of their income. 
I describe this situation because it dramatizes our future. Americans continue to have longer and longer life expectancies. The population aged 80 and older is growing faster than any other age group, proportionally. This are group currently receives inadequate pension and individual savings income, and has needed to rely more heavily on Social Security. The plain fact is that as America grows older, this group of Americans simply must have access to more in the areas of pension coverage and personal savings if they are to maintain a dignified standard of living. 
The current national picture is also not equitable with regard to the treatment of women. Currently, women are almost twice as likely as men to live in poverty in their retirement years--a 15.7 percent poverty rate versus an 8.9 percent poverty rate for men. For women who are widowed or divorced, the picture is worse still--widows suffer a poverty rate of 21.5 percent, divorcees 29.1 percent. Thus, the task force placed high priority on including provisions designed to help women generate saving in their own name. 
Also of note are the discrepancies in income sources between high-income and low-income Americans. Among elderly Americans in the lowest quintile, Social Security constitutes 82.6 percent of their income. Their next biggest source is public assistance--SSI, unemployment compensation, and other such sources--which make up 9.1 percent of their income stream. Thus, poorest Americans would benefit the most from expansions of existing pension coverage. 
Mr. President, it is, therefore, essential that this Nation pursue policies that increase pension and individual savings in the private sector. One added reason for this is the plight of Social Security. Thus far, Congress has not been willing to address Social Security's enormous unfunded liability. Under current practices, we will continue to pour the annual Social Security surplus into current Government consumption. We have no method to pay for Social Security's trillions in unfunded liability other than the promise of future Government taxation. 
Although few are willing to admit it, it is clear from the projections that Social Security in the 21st century will not be able to deliver as large a share of the income of retired Americans as it does today. That is simply not possible when the projected worker-to-collector ratios for the program will hit only 2 to 1 within a generation. When the program is brought into balance, as it must be, what will happen to the millions of Americans who rely on Social Security for the majority of their retirement income? The answer, Mr. President, depends on how successful we are in providing for retirement income via other means. 
Our task force approached these problems in as objective a fashion as we could. We decided early on that the problem was one of inadequate saving, instead of one of inadequate regulation, or inequitable distribution. Indeed, many existing regulations and distribution requirements have actually worked against the aim of expanded pension coverage, because they deter employers from providing it. The result is that many small business owners do not believe that they can afford to offer pension coverage. Mr. President, we must begin to make it easier--in fact, we must begin to make it attractive--for employers to offer pensions. 
There is a single common theme that runs through the Republican approach to retirement security: Retirement income comes from retirement saving. It comes from nowhere else. Everything in our package aims at generating additional retirement saving in a reasonably direct way. Government must do more to encourage saving, and in many ways this is best done by doing less to discourage it. We have produced a package that would make it easier for additional retirement saving to occur, by facilitating saving via a broad variety of measures. 
That is not to say that we did not identify areas of the law where there were simply technical adjustments to be made. Often there are absurd regulatory inconsistencies in our pension structures. We penalize employers who do not properly fund pension plans, but on the other hand, we prevent others from funding the full amount of liabilities that they know are coming. Or we will treat employer contributions one way, but the contributions of the 
self-employed another way. There is a host of confusing, sometimes inconsistent, regulations in effect. We did our best to identify and to rectify such problems and inconsistencies in existing law. 
This package seeks to increase saving through individual savings incentives, through employer funding of pension plans, through simplification, through expanded portability, through defined contribution plans, and through defined benefit plans. We attempted to increase savings on every front. We cast our net wide. Thus, we have a package that is a veritable smorgasbord of reforms, more than Congress could possibly enact this year. But we have produced a host of proposals that are each candidates for at least partial inclusion in budget reconciliation, and I believe that Congress would do well to favorably consider them. 
Because we attempted to approach our task with this specific policy objective in mind--increasing savings--we did not set ourselves up to oppose every idea that originated in another place. The centerpiece proposals of our package--full IRA deductibility for every American, the WISE women's equity package, and the new SAFE defined benefit plan--are not included in the package of pension proposals offered by the minority party. But we did not reject some good technical corrections merely because they have appeared in the work of others. I believe that there is a basis for Congress to review the proposals offered separately by Republicans, and by Democrats, and to pursue many initiatives on which there is a broad area of common ground. 
I would like to thank Majority Leader Lott for convening the task force and for selecting me to be its chairman. I also wish to thank Senator Larry Craig for his helpful coordination of the various Republican task force efforts. I wish to thank each of the members of the Senate Republican Retirement Security Task Force--Senators Bond, Collins, Hutchison, Jeffords, Murkowski, Roberts, Santorum, Faircloth--but most especially Finance Committee Chairman Senator William Roth, whose work was absolutely instrumental to this drafting effort. I would like to single out Doug Fisher of Senator Roth's staff for the technical advice and assistance that he provided to me and to my staff at every stage of this process. 
It would be appropriate at this point to say a word of appreciation to Senator Graham of Florida as well, for his parallel work in fashioning a bipartisan package of pension reforms that I understand will be introduced later this week. Our Republican task force has communicated in open and good faith with his bipartisan group, and there have been times when we have found ourselves working on overlapping ground. Senator Graham and his staff have made important and original contributions to a bipartisan effort to promote retirement security, and I believe that we can work with Senator Graham and others in this coalition, throughout the reconciliation process and beyond, to pursue reforms of common interest. 
Let me now turn to the specific provisions of our legislation. 
Title I would establish a fully deductible IRA for every American. The IRA is becoming a cornerstone of national retirement policy, and the Federal Government should not deter anyone from participating by limiting or eliminating the tax deductibility of the option. We endorse the Roth/Breaux schedule of phasing out the limits on IRA deductibility by 2001, and of indexing the contribution limits for inflation. We would also create the option of the back-loaded IRA--in which contributions are taxed when they are made, instead of upon withdrawal--in order to mitigate the revenue implications in the near-term. Stimulating personal saving--making it attractive for every American to adopt the habit of contributing to an IRA each year--is an important first step toward meeting tomorrow's retirement income needs. 
Title II is the WISE bill introduced earlier this year. Already this important piece of legislation has 25 co-sponsors. These women's equity initiatives include a strengthening of the homemaker IRA, permitting a homemaker to make a fully deductible IRA contribution, regardless of whether his or her spouse receives an employer-provided pension. In addition, we would permit individuals who take maternity or paternity leave to make catch-up contributions to their 401-(k) or similar plans for the time missed from work. And--the most creative part of our legislation--we would permit individuals who are absent from pension plan participation for an extended period to raise a child--to make additional contributions upon return, and to catch up for up to 18 years of absence. 
The WISE legislation is extremely popular, and I do not need to 
describe it at length here. However, I would say that it recognizes an important principle too frequently unrecognized in our pension law: That individuals do not have the same opportunities to save at every stage of their lives. Frequently, the financial pressures of raising a child prevent parents from attending to their own retirement saving. WISE attempts to give some flexibility, to permit individuals to put away more money when, at last, they have the surplus income to do so. 
Title III of our bill is targeted at expanding pension coverage in small business. This, Mr. President, is a title of our legislation that is just as vital as the first two, for a number of important reasons. First, it is those individuals who work for small businesses who are most likely to lack pension coverage. Second, we felt it was very important in this legislation to do something to make defined benefit plans more attractive to employers. The task force concluded that removing impediments to defined contribution saving was extremely important, but we could not stop there: We needed to pursue parallel methods with respect to establishing pension coverage for individuals who do not have discretionary income to put into retirement savings. 
Title III of our legislation begins with the SAFE plan--a fully portable, fully funded, defined benefit plan designed for small business. This legislation attempts to make defined benefit plans a more realistic option for small businesses, just as the SIMPLE plan did last year for defined contribution plans. Because SAFE is a method of creating a defined benefit plan without running into the problems with funding and complex regulation that have deterred small businesses from offering other defined benefit plans, it is good for employers. And because it offers a defined benefit funded by the employer, rather than dependent upon employee contributions, it is good for lower income employees. 
In essence, the way SAFE works is this: An employer can choose to establish a SAFE plan that accrues at either a 1-percent, a 2-percent, or a 3-percent rate. What this means is that for every year the employee works, they get either 1 percent, 2 percent, or 3 percent of their salary as their defined benefit upon retirement. If, for example, the employee works for 25 years in a plan that accrues at 3 percent, then their retirement benefit will be 75 percent of working income. Everyone in the plan accrues at the same rate. So the employer can make a choice: If they fund at 
the lower rate--say, 1 percent--then they will diminish the size of their own pension benefits as well as that of their employees. By treating all employees equally, across the board, SAFE bypasses the need for complex nondiscrimination requirements. Fair treatment is assured by the basic construction of the plan. 
SAFE plans are fully funded by the employer. The employer must fund the benefits such that, when a 5 percent interest rate is assumed, enough will be present at time of retirement to pay the defined benefit. If the employer is able to do better, in managing the plan, then that 5 percent interest rate, then the extra goes back into the pension benefits. Annually, the plan is monitored to ensure that the employer has kept pace with that 5 percent rate. If not, then the employer must make a makeup contribution at year's end. So, in all events, the pension benefits are protected. It is annually assured that the promised benefits are fully funded, and it is also possible that the beneficiary will receive more. Moreover, because each individual's pension benefit is fully funded in advance by a defined amount, it is fully portable--the benefit can travel with the employee easily when they switch jobs. 
The SAFE plan gives a small business owner the opportunity to create a simple defined benefit plan that has the potential to provide large pension benefits--for both the employees and the employer. Because of that potential and its resulting incentive, and because of the protection from messy discrimination rules, SAFE plans will be an attractive alternative for small businesses. And by creating this alternative, we increase the opportunities for lower income individuals to receive defined benefit pension coverage that they might not be able to fund via a defined contribution system. 
It will take too much of the Senate's time to list every aspect of our comprehensive legislation, but I invite Senators to review this and other provisions we have created to make pensions more attractive to small business owners in title III of the bill. 
Title IV contains assorted measures to ensure pension portability. This is essential in a mobile society such as ours, in which pension coverage is lowest among short-tenured young workers, moving from job to job. We do not generate retirement saving if these pension benefits simply turn into a cash-out every time one changes jobs. Our legislation would protect plans 
that accept rollovers from disqualification, and also specifically facilitate rollovers between a large variety of plans--government plans, nonprofit plans, and others. 
Title V of the legislation deals with pension security. We felt it was important to highlight our finding that pension managers have an obligation to comply with the intent of ERISA, which directs that they manage these plans with an eye solely toward maximizing the accumulation of pension assets, not pursuing an external purpose, whether social, political, or any other. Accordingly, we would eliminate the promotion of the Department of Labor's Economically Targeted Investments Program. The last thing that we want, Mr. president, is for pension managers to feel pressured into investing in any vehicles that they do not believe meet the best interests of future pension beneficiaries. To the extent that these economically targeted investments produce healthy, sound investments, they do not need promotion by the Department of Labor. To the extent that they do not, pension managers should not invest in them. 
Also in title V, Mr. President, is an important provision that gradually increases the current limitation on full employer funding of pension liabilities. Right now, employers may fund for no more than 150 percent of current liability, even when they may know that future liabilities are accruing and must be funded. This is short-sighted policy by the Federal Government, undertaken solely to protect the Federal balance sheet, by limiting the tax deductibility of pension contributions. I would argue that this existing policy, in the long run, does not even protect the Federal balance sheet, because ultimately, these liabilities must be funded, and the deduction therefore taken. It is better to permit employers to invest the money now, and to let that investment compound to meet future liabilities, rather than to forbid them from doing so, and thereby force them to make a larger contribution later--and then claim an even larger deduction. We must take a far-sighted approach to funding pensions, and not discourage proper pension funding simply because we are looking at a short-term budget window here in the Federal Government. Our provision would gradually increase the 150 percent limit, by 5 percent every 2 years. 
Finally, title VI deals with another vital area of pension reform--pension simplification. In this title, Mr. President, Senators will find a host of changes that eliminate existing inconsistencies within law and regulation, as well as facilitating the use of electronic technology to replace cumbersome paperwork. I would draw the attention of the Senate to one particular provision here that would exempt Government plans from existing nondiscrimination rules. These nondiscrimination rules, Mr. President, were not designed for Government plans, and it has proved very vexatious to determine how to apply them in cases when the employer is a government body. I believe that many Senators have probably heard from administrators of State government retirement plans regarding the need to make this exemption permanent, and our bill would do so. This is one provision, Mr. President, that I believe we should seek to include in budget reconciliation this year. 
Mr. President, I am very proud to introduce this legislation. Tax law in this area is complicated and dry--I have become too familiar with that these last months--but it is imperative that we shoulder the burden of reforming it to make it work more simply, and more effectively, to encourage greater retirement income saving. I have worked long and hard to create this legislation, and I believe that it represents a good comprehensive effort to enhance the future retirement security of millions of Americans. I thank the rest of the task force, and the majority leader, for this opportunity to lead in this important work, and I commend this legislation to the Senate for its favorable consideration.

Mr. GREGG. Madam President, for the information of all Members and on behalf of the leader, today, from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m., the Senate will be in a period of morning business. It is the leader's hope that the Senate will be able to consider S. 419, the Birth Defects Prevention Act. Again, this bill is noncontroversial and the Senate should be able to complete action on this important matter in no more than 30 minutes. 
In addition, it is the leader's hope that we will be able to consider some of the available executive nominations on today's Executive Calendar. The leader also hopes the Senate will be allowed to consider these items as we are fast approaching the July recess. 
In addition, the leader wishes to put all Senators on notice that there is much work to do between now and the start of the adjournment, and that Senators should be prepared to be present and working during the next couple of weeks. And the leader further thanks his colleagues for their attention.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I introduce, with Senators Ford, Hagel, and Graham a sliding-scale capital gains proposal, the Long-Term Investment Act of 1997. Given the sobering demographics associated with the impending aging of the baby-boom generation, it is more important than ever that laws enacted by Congress promote long-term capital investment and savings by all Americans. 
Central to this objective is a reduction in the current capital gains tax rate on long-term investments. A capital gains reduction was agreed to in principle in the budget agreement. We have a proposal that we believe embodies a fundamental change in tax policy at less cost. Over the next 10 years, S. 2 will cost $129 billion, while Gregg/Ford will cost $45 billion. 
We have developed a plan that would encourage long-term investments through a sliding-scale capital gains rate reduction. The plan would encourage individuals to hold assets over a number of years, allowing no reduction in the current rate on assets held for less than 1 year, with increasingly larger deductions to a maximum 50 percent reduction for investments held more than 8 years. 
This sliding-scale plan encourages investments that will benefit long-term savings and capital--such as providing for a child's education or retirement income. The bill also rewards the small business owner and entrepreneurs as it will allow for a significant reduction in capital gains taxation that benefits those individuals who invest in the economy through the creation of small businesses and jobs. By rewarding long-term investment in businesses and job creation and discouraging the quick fix that so often is associated with speculation on Wall Street, we will be placing our Tax Code and job base on a more solid ground. 
The Gregg/Ford sliding-scale reduction on capital gains taxation hinges on balancing two important goals--the promotion of savings and long-term investment through a significant capital gains cut, while also recognizing our current fiscal restraints. 
The recent budget agreement reached between the President and Congress calls for a net tax cut of $85 billion and a gross tax cut of $135 billion over 5 years. The details of how this tax package should be put together will be worked out by the appropriate committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. 
The Clinton administration has indicated that it is for a capital gains rate reduction, but not in favor of a rate that dips below 20 percent. I believe that this bill is a consensus building bill that both sides can and will agree upon in the not-too-distant future.

 Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of Nancy Jean Coutu, a Peace Corps volunteer who was murdered by native tribesmen on April 9, 1996, while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Madagascar. 
Nancy was a young woman whose life was dedicated to helping others. She was born and raised in New Hampshire and attended the University of New Hampshire. She was full of joy and giving and her desire to help others is what brought her to join the Peace Corps in 1994. She spent almost 2 years living in the village of Baraketa where she helped the villagers build a school and rebuild a small hospital. She also pursued her interest in the environment by studying the local ecology. Her tragic death was a shock to everyone who knew and loved her, including the people of Madagascar whose government posthumously awarded her a knighthood for her work in their country. 
Nancy's family and friends have chosen to honor her memory by creating a memorial to her on a beautiful maple-shaded knoll in Elm Brook Park in West Hopkinton, NH. During the summers of 1992 and 1993, while a student at the University of New Hampshire, Nancy worked as a park ranger at Elm Brook. There she spent many hours working to expand her knowledge and interest in the environment and to share her love of nature with visitors to the park. On Sunday, June 15, 1997, the memorial, with its large granite stone and plaque, and an oil painting of Nancy done by her mother, will be dedicated. In addition, because she was particularly interested in helping the handicapped to enjoy the many experiences offered by the outdoors, the park's wheelchair accessible elevated wildlife viewing observation deck, fishing platform, and nature trail will also be dedicated to Nancy. 
Nancy Coutu set a shining example of what can be accomplished through public service and voluntarism and I would like to join with her family, friends, and all those whose lives she touched with her love, in commending her for her courage and willingness to give of herself in order to make life better for others.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the proposal that has been brought forward by the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Massachusetts. I oppose it on a variety of different levels, and let me talk about them. 
First off, let us go back to where we stand here. We have before us a budget agreement, a bipartisan budget agreement that was worked out in negotiations, extensive negotiations, between the White House, the Republican leadership of the House and Senate, and the Democratic leadership of the House and Senate, at least relative to the Budget Committee, and that agreement included in it language to address the issue of uncovered children who are of a low income. Let us define the size of this issue for a second because there has been a lot of misrepresentation on this so far on this floor. 
There are about 9.8 million kids who it is believed do not have insurance, or about 13.8 percent of the child population of the country. Of that group, 3.7 million are qualified to be covered by Medicaid. In other words, under the law that we presently have, they really do have insurance; they just have not been brought in under Medicaid. So we do not need a new law to cover those kids. And of that number, that 9.8, we have reduced it now by 3.7 and you are down to 6.1. Of that 6.1 that is left, about 2.9 million are over 200 percent of poverty--over 200 percent of poverty--which means that the family has an income of some ability and for some reason they are not using that income to cover those children. 
So the number of kids that are under 200 percent of poverty who are uncovered by Medicaid is really 3.2 million. So that is the population we are talking about. 
Now, in this bill, the bipartisan agreement that was reached, approximately $16 billion was set aside to cover children of low income who are not covered. That is a very significant commitment and certainly more than enough money to pick up 2.9 million children--to pick up the 3.2 million children who are uncovered today and to also make sure that in the Medicaid accounts we can pick up those children who are covered today under Medicaid but have not been brought in under Medicaid. 
So this bill as it is proposed, as it was brought forward, the bipartisan agreement as it was brought forward already had 
in it a very substantial commitment to children who do not have health insurance who are in low-income families. 
What else would you expect? Essentially, one of the great insults of this amendment, one of the great insults of this amendment is it is saying that the President of the United States, who reached this agreement on this budget, does not care about children, does not care about uninsured children. Essentially, that is what one of the underlying tones of this amendment is. Or I suspect some of the authors of this amendment feel this way anyway, that the Republicans do not care about uncovered children, which I would argue is totally inaccurate and inappropriate but maybe from a partisan standpoint is a point made. 
It is ironic that one of the elements of this proposal is a representation that the bipartisan budget package, which has in it $16 billion specifically directed at children who are not presently receiving health care insurance and who are in low-income families, is not enough, that the President did not know what he was doing; that he does not care; therefore, we have to have this brand new layer placed on top of the package. 
It really is a position which is hard to defend just on its face. But on the face of its indefensibility let us go into the substance of it because the substance of this proposal is totally indefensible. 
There has been a representation made that this is a discretionary program. If this is a discretionary program, my golf game is the same as Tiger Woods'. They are about as closely related. The fact is that this is not a discretionary program or anywhere near in the ballpark of discretionary programs. This is a mandatory unfunded mandate on the States. It is a mandatory program on the Federal Government. It is a program which is grossly underestimated in its cost because of the impact it will have on the marketplace in taking kids who are already in the private-sector insurance realm and moving them onto the public-sector realm. 
It is a classic big Government solution to a problem which ironically the bipartisan budget agreement has addressed not only with dollars but with initiatives to try to give the States the creativity to take this issue on and which the States are today actually taking on and resolving. And I will get into that in a second. 
But let us go back to this complete red herring, that this is some sort of discretionary program. Now, the proposal as it comes to us is in vague terms so we have to go back to the bill that was introduced by the Senators who are the authors of this agreement in order to find the underlying language which defines the program. That bill is not included but it is obviously assumed, and if you go back to section 2802 of that bill, this sets up the new entitlement. In the bill in this section a State must--it does not say `may.' `May' is a discretionary word. `Shall' is not a discretionary word. 
It says, `The States shall guarantee issuance of Medicaid level benefits to all eligible children.' And not only do they say `shall,' they cover that `shall' with all sorts of restrictions; 39 times in this bill the States are told what to do. They shall do this, they shall do that, they shall do this. Every time it says that, every time it says that in the bill, it is a mandate, and every time it says it in the bill it is a major cost. Section 2803 is where the shalls begin. 
Now, not only are the folks who drafted this bill not satisfied with creating a mandate on the States--and I will get into the unfunded aspect in a second--not only are they unsatisfied with creating a mandate on the States, they decided let's create a new mandate. Let's do it the old-fashioned way. Let's not only mandate what the States have to do. Let's mandate the private sector at the same time. 
This bill includes a private-sector mandate that says essentially, depending on how a State defines its Medicaid eligibility rules, every private employer in the State must supply health care benefits at the same level as Medicaid to children. 
Wow. This is a big-time, old-fashioned Government proposal. This is right out of the old 1960's school of Lyndon Johnson, how you make Government gigantic and how you make Government not work, I would point out, because one of the things we found out is that when we create one of these massive new entitlements that absorbs a whole area of activity under Federal control--and this entitlement does exactly that, basically giving unbelievable authority to HHS, eliminating waivers for Medicaid, grandfathering the HHS regulatory structure. When you do that, what happens is that you create major Federal programs which fail. 
Why do they fail? Because all the knowledge does not happen to come out of Washington. And what is happening in the States today is that you are seeing a tremendous amount of creative initiative to try to cover these kids who need to be covered. 
There is no argument about coverage here. The bipartisan budget agreement states there will be coverage. The argument is about whether or not you are going to do it with a massive new federally dominated, directed, controlled and 
managed program or whether you are going to do it by allowing the States the flexibility of initiating programs and addressing the issue of the concerns of these kids. 
This bill creates a brandnew, major Federal entitlement. It is not only a Federal entitlement in the classic sense of an entitlement on the States; as I mentioned, it is an entitlement that forces the private employer to take action, and that is a mandate, an unfunded mandate. 
Of course, the first action which this Congress took when the Republicans took control of it was to say that we were not going to create unfunded mandates anymore. At least, if we were, we were going to require a supermajority. So this bill should be subject to a supermajority if it ever came up for a vote. But whether it is or not, it undermines the intent, which was to stop putting mandates on the States that are unfunded. 
Now, why is this unfunded? Because, of course, there is this dollar figure that is attached to this. It is an additional $20 billion which is paid for by the cigarette tax--which is not the issue I am addressing, the cigarette tax. It is unfunded because of the way it is structured. It guarantees that the cost of this health care package will exceed the amount of money that is in the proposal--guarantees it. All we need to do is look at history. All we need to do is look at the CBO estimations of what would happen if you applied Medicaid coverage to a full group, to this targeted population. We know that the practical effect of that will be to exceed $20 billion by who knows how much, but it will be a heck of a lot. 
So what you have created is an unfunded mandate. You have created a cap that says, all right, States, the Federal Government will require you to pay this money. We know it is not enough money, but we are going to require you to pay it. Then when we go over the amount of money that we are going to put into the package, well, you have to pay it yourself. You have to pay the difference. Unfunded mandate. And some will say, well, that cannot be. 
Why would that be any different? If that is the case, doesn't the present budget agreement understate the amount of money that is necessary to cover these children? Well, the difference here is in the insidiousness of this agreement, of this proposal in its ability to draw people into a Federal program. Because the way this proposal is drafted, it absolutely guarantees for all intents and purposes that people will be moving out of private-sector coverage and into the public-sector coverage, that a lot of children who are today being covered by their employers, by their parents' employers are going to end up moving over to be covered by the Government. 
Why is that? Because it is requiring a one-size-fits-all health care package be applied to all children, all children who fall in this income category, but, even more importantly, under the way this bill is drafted and interpreted, applying that same package could be required upon all employers within a State. 
So you are going to have a dramatic, what is known as woodwork effect, where people move from the private sector coverage into the public sector coverage. It is just going to be overwhelming. 
What employer in their right mind is going to say, `OK, I am going to continue covering this parent's children,' when the employer is already paying a huge tax burden and the Government is being told that they must cover this child if this child is not covered by the employer. Very few will be so altruistic. For all intents and purposes, what we are doing is federalizing the health care system--nationalizing the health care system, not federalizing; this is no Federal program, this is a national program--nationalizing the health care system for all children, for all intents and purposes, who fall into this category, the majority of whom, today--the majority of whom, today, are covered by private-sector insurance. So, the open-ended cost of this program is absolutely staggering--staggering. And the concept that the costs will be controlled to $20 billion is absurd on its face, equal in absurdity only to the claim that this is some sort of discretionary program. 
How does our bipartisan budget agreement, which the President has signed on to and which tries to address these children's concerns, approach this issue? Essentially, what it does is acknowledge the fact that in the States there are some things going on that are working. Take my State of New Hampshire, for example. There are 33 States, I believe, that are pursuing this type of approach. Recognizing we have a targeted uncovered population that needs to be covered, we have set up this program called Healthy Kids. This is a partnership between the private-sector insurers and the State. In fact, at the present time it is hardly costing the State anything because it has gotten the private-sector insurers to come in and cover these children. 
In the targeted area where they are doing the demonstration program, 50 percent of the kids who would fall into the uninsured categories which this bill alleges it is trying to cover are being covered at essentially no additional cost to the taxpayer--50 percent. It is a darned successful program. It would not be able to continue under this bill. All 33 States that have initiated creative programs to address children's health insurance would have their programs wiped out because we in Washington have decided to take over the issue, to nationalize the issue with this proposal put forward by our colleagues. So, a program which is insuring 50 percent of these kids at no cost to the taxpayers will be replaced by a program that will draw a whole new group of kids out of the private sector into the public sector to be covered and will, in the process, drive up costs dramatically and increase the taxpayers' costs dramatically, and, I would point out, for that 50 percent of the kids who presently have coverage under the Healthy Kids Program, will have almost no impact on their quality of health care. 
So, what our bipartisan budget proposal puts forward--not ours, the one put forward by the President and the leadership of the Senate and the House--is to allow these types of initiatives to proceed; not with as much flexibility as I like, and I may offer an amendment to give these States more flexibility, but with a heck of a lot more flexibility than is proposed by this straitjacket of mandated unfunded mandates in this bill that is the underlying essence of this proposal. 
So, why not let the States try to do it? Why not say to the States: All right, there is a population out there that is not covered. See what sort of programs you can come up with to cover them and meet these limited criteria, criteria that they have to be covered under a certain health care structure. It is working, working in 33 States, but it will not work after this bill is passed. 
Let me read part of a letter I received from the deputy commissioner of health and human services in New Hampshire, who is a professional. She is not a political appointee. She is a professional. She was looking at this question of how we address these kids who are in need, and thinking of the Healthy Kids programs that we have in New Hampshire and evaluating the various programs. Here is what she stated was the core of the need, in the way the Congress should approach this issue. She says:  
Consideration must be given to balancing the financial incentives provided in the States to implement health care expansion while retaining sufficient flexibility for innovation. There are multiple [multiple, a word which appears to have escaped the concept of this bill] multiple strategies to extend health care coverage to the uninsured, including preventive, catastrophic coverage options. Please recognize the efforts that are currently underway in many States across this Nation and their value in promoting our common goal, extending health care to those that currently have none. 
Basically, what she is saying is what I suspect every administrator of health care at every State agency of health and human services would say if you asked them. It is their goal to 
cover the kids who are not covered. What the bipartisan budget agreement does is fund that ability. What the proposal before us does is deny that ability, relative to flexibility at the State level, and to take out of the hands of the States the ability to manage this issue in any way, shape or manner, and to nationalize the health care delivery of--essentially all children who fall within this income category, but potentially even a dramatically larger group of people, if the bill is applied to private employers, as I happen to believe it will end up being under its present language. 
So, this bill--which is brought forward to us as some sort of proposal that is a discretionary program just meant to help kids who do not have coverage--will, in my opinion, have the practical effect of not only not accomplishing its goal, because it is certainly not discretionary--and I do not think it is going to help any more kids than would be helped under the bipartisan budget agreement structure as is proposed--but it would create a massive new entitlement, a massive new unfunded mandate, a massive new federally directed regulatory structure, and would essentially emasculate the private sector's efforts to respond to this area, and private insurance as it presently covers these children. 
I can't think of any program which would be more counterproductive and, put in the context of the history of other nationalization efforts, will be less successful than that. I mean, essentially we have been down this road. We have been down this road and we found this type of approach to solving national problems does not work. Having the Federal Government come in and take things over does not work. This budget agreement attempts to address this issue constructively. It funds, at the level of $16 billion, children who do not have health insurance coverage, yet it leaves some modicum of flexibility with the States to address the issue. So, I find this proposal to be not only not compelling, but to be extraordinarily counterproductive to its underlying goal, which is to obtain fiscal responsibility and to cover children who do not have health insurance. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Under the language in the bill presented by the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Massachusetts, that program would essentially be overridden. That program would no longer exist, because the eligibility requirements are strict, those required under the Kennedy bill are so strict that the Utah program would no longer fit in it and therefore could no longer function. 
This bill would eliminate that Utah program, along with 33 other States. Is the Senator aware of that?

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise again to recall some of the comments I made earlier, but also to address a couple of other issues that have been raised here. 
First off, I think it is good that the Senator from Massachusetts has finally admitted--I suspect maybe over the active opposition of his colleague from Utah--that this is a mandated program. He calls it a `capped mandated program,' I call it an unfunded mandated program, but the fact is, we finally got it out in the open. This is a brand new major entitlement, and it is a mandated entitlement. There is nothing discretionary about this, nothing at all discretionary about this. 
As I said earlier, if this is discretionary, this has the same relationship of being discretionary as my golf game has to Tiger Woods'. The simple fact is, it has no relationship to discretionary. 
Let's talk about a couple specific events that occurred relative to the States that get stuck with this program, because they are all going to get stuck with this program. Under section 2802, States lose almost all flexibility in designing health care programs for kids--almost all flexibility. Under section 2802, programs like the one we have in New Hampshire, which I described earlier which is covering in its demonstration period up to 50 percent of the kids we are trying to target without additional public costs, and we will get to the 100 percent as we develop a plan under the proposal in this budget agreement, which gives us the additional money to do that, but that plan will be wiped out. And there are 33 other States in this country that have initiatives going forward to address these targeted youth, targeted children, which programs would be put at dramatic risk, if not be wiped out. 
I suggest the interpretation of the amendment of the Senator from Utah is inconsistent with the amendment's language itself. The amendment states very clearly--very clearly--that States must comply with the Medicaid criteria for supplying health care, and almost in every State, these initiatives that are going forward do not comply exactly with the Medicaid criteria as for insurance purposes. So flexibility is denied. 
Not only does that happen, as I mentioned earlier, this amendment is just the ultimate in the Federal Government coming in and taking over an entire sector of health care. It is a nationalization of health care for, basically, kids and, thus, creating a tremendous movement from the private sector to the public sector with costs, as kids will move out of private-sector coverage on to public coverage. 
Not only does that occur, but this amendment specifically states that waivers are rejected now. I have to tell you, as a former Governor, it is hard to get waivers, but one of the good things that this President has done is that he has loosened up the waiver process, and Secretary Shalala has been receptive to States that come forward with ideas relative to Medicaid and have asked for waivers. I suspect Utah and I suspect Massachusetts--I know Massachusetts, and I know New Hampshire and New Mexico have all participated in this waiver process to try to deliver better health care using imaginative and creative ideas that the State health agencies develop. But do you know what this amendment says? It says, `Tough luck, States. From here on out, we give no waivers at all'--the ultimate regulatory dictatorial action; the ultimate excess of the Federal regulatory structure. 
This is a power grab, pure and simple, an attempt to move the issue of how you finance health care for kids in America to the Federal level and, as a result, it is an outrageous--an outrageous--new mandated program. It is nice we finally have an admission of that after all the denial we heard earlier, which I found incredible, but finally we have an admission that this is a mandated program. 
The practical effect of creating this program will be it is going to cost an additional $20 billion on top of the $16 billion already in the budget for this targeted population which can be taken care of, as so appropriately presented by the Senator from Texas, with the $16 billion, which obviously can be taken care of because the President signed on to it and it is his No. 1 priority. This is such an insult to the President to bring this forward in this manner, because they are essentially saying the President didn't know what he was talking about when he said he could take care of this problem with $16 billion. 
They are saying we need $36 billion to do it. The reason they need $36 billion, and $36 billion is an extraordinarily low estimate, is because they have a nationalization plan. That is what they are planning, they are planning to have all the kids today who are in working families who have low incomes but who happen to be covered by health insurance moving off that private sector on to the public sector. There will be a stampede of employers essentially saying, `We're no longer going to cover you, you have to be covered by the public sector.' That is why the price is going up. That is why they need all this extra money. 
It is not going to give any child any more coverage of any significant nature. All it is going to do is allow the Federal Government to take over the program and allow the taxpayers to pick up a large percentage of the costs which is presently being picked up by the employer. 
It is truly an outrage for us--after we have been down this road for the last 40 years of seeing Federal programs that have not worked when the Federal Government has federalized them, programs where the States have been delivering services, and suddenly the Federal Government comes in and federalizes it and we see they do not work, and in an attempt to address that just a year ago, we tried to reverse the situation with welfare, for example, and move the programs back to the States--for us to have proposed before us a program which says essentially the Federal Government knows best, States are going to be written out of the process, and we are going to create a huge new cost to the taxpayers of this country so that some bureaucrats here in Washington can control the definition of how kids are delivered health care and in the process wipe out the coverage that is occurring in the private sector and the capacity of States to have flexibility, it is just a public policy initiative which is totally inconsistent with what has been the flow of events in this country from a standpoint of knowing what works and what does not work in the last few years. 
We have this one other issue that keeps being thrown in our face: We have a choice between tobacco and children. That is not the choice. The choice is between whether or not we want to nationalize health care or whether we want to let the States continue to participate in the process. There is no choice on coverage here. The President has demanded, and we have put in because we believe it is appropriate, $16 billion to cover kids, to cover the targeted population. That is a fait accompli; it is done. The extra $20 billion demanded in this amendment, which is going to be paid for by a tobacco tax increase, has nothing to do with coverage. What it has to do with is federalization, nationalization of a program. So this does not have anything to do with a choice between kids and tobacco. The kids have already won. We have already in this bill taken care of that issue. 
Now, if the other side were honest about this, they would allow us to divide the question. They would allow us to divide the question, and let's have a vote on the tobacco tax increase, independent of this brand new major entitlement. But they are not going to let us divide the question. I will move to divide the question. It will be objected to. 
I am happy to have an up-or-down vote on tobacco tax increases. As Governor, I increased tobacco taxes. I do think it is an area we should leave to the States, because I do think it is a revenue source most States like to use. I know my State of New Hampshire right now has another tobacco tax proposal on the table to pay for kindergarten. If this goes through, I suspect the projected income from that tax increase to pay for the kindergarten program will be severely restrained. 
These two have been joined together in order for somebody to have a nice little phrase they can put on television at night, but it has no relationship to reality, substance or the manner in which this bill is structured and the way it will deliver services, because we have, in the bipartisan budget agreement--well, the President has in the bipartisan budget agreement, with the support of the leadership of the Congress, committed to caring for these kids and making sure they have insurance. 
All this plan does is create a brand new huge bureaucracy which is going to, once again, federalize the system, write the States out of the process, eliminate the private sector effort in the area and give a Federal bureaucracy new lateral control over an element of the economy or an area of the economy where the States are making progress and where with the underlying budget proposal problem will be generally solved. 
So it is about as misdirected a proposal as I have seen in recent times, probably not since the Clinton health care plan have I seen a more misdirected proposal, and I believe that was appropriately rejected and I hope this proposal will be appropriately rejected. 
I yield back my time.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, just to clarify the record on this, this amendment was addressing the issue of funding relative to special education which is, I believe, a critical element of the whole issue obviously of special education, especially the fact that the Federal Government has failed to live up to its obligation to fund 40 percent of the cost of special education. It is only funding approximately 7 to 8 percent of the cost. 
After discussions with the majority leader, and with members of the Appropriations Committee on which I serve, I think there is a reasonable opportunity that we will receive the type of funding and support we need in order to start on the path toward reaching the 40 percent. 
This path was outlined in S. 1, Senate bill 1, which is the Senate Republican position and which commits to having us fund 40 percent over a 7-year period. This year I am hopeful we can increase funding for special ed so we can get up above the $4 billion mark in this account, which would allow us to--under the new bill, if it is passed, as I presume it will be--allow us to kick in the ability of the local communities to use some of this special ed funding which the Federal Government was supposed to be paying for, which presently is being paid for by local taxpayers, to use those local taxpayer dollars for other areas of education and to relieve some of the pressure on the communities and the local taxpayers. 
So with that understanding, which is not formal--I appreciate that--but which I believe was made in good faith, I am withdrawing this amendment. I recognize a lot of work has gone into this bill, that there is a great desire to pass this bill without amendments so it will be able to be moved quickly and because it involves an intricate and delicate, delicate compromise. And it is a step forward in the attempt to address the IDEA question and issue of caring for children with disabilities. 
This amendment I believe would have had a good chance of passing, but I believe it also would have undermined the desire of those who want to reach an accommodation to make sure to move the process forward and improve the basic special ed bill, and we can do so with this bill, and it would undermine the capacity to do that. 
I still believe we can still get to the role of the funding issue which runs on a parallel course without necessarily having to attach this specific language to this bill. 
I would note that the law continues to retain in it the 40 percent language. It remains the commitment of the Federal Government and it is a commitment which I and I know the majority, the chairman of the committee, ranking member on the subcommittee, and the majority leader are committed to try to reach.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, let me begin by speaking a little bit about the underlying bill and congratulating the chairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords, and the Presiding Officer for their extraordinary work in developing this bill. The Senator from Tennessee, the Senator from Vermont, and the Senator from Iowa, of course, have been involved in this issue for years and years and have worked very hard together, as have a number of Members of the Senate and House. 
It has been acknowledged that Senator Lott, through his excellent representation and his chief of staff, David Hoppe, has done an extraordinary amount of lifting to make sure that this process has come to closure. It was not an easy one. Meetings went on for dramatic lengths of time. There were complications, controversial issues which people had vested interests in which were very deep and intensely felt. The fact that a final product was reached, and an agreement has been brought before the Senate, reflects the genuine effort of a lot of very good people. It is a product which will benefit many children in this country as it goes forward and represents a new day for special education. It is really not a reauthorization of the special education bill but basically a new bill, a new approach, in many ways. It should be looked on as such. 
I got involved in special education a long time ago, in fact, before I was even able to vote. I was working at a center called the Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center, which began as a center to care for children who have polio, and when that disease was, fortunately, beaten, it moved on to care for children who had problems with hearing, deaf children, specifically, and then when that issue was resolved in many ways relative to needing special schools and those children could find their way into the mainstream, it moved on to dealing with children with very complex physical disabilities, sometimes emotional disabilities. It is and continues to be the premier facility, or one of the premier facilities, in the country for caring and educating--that is the basic goal of the Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center--children with disabilities, and does it in a variety of ways. 
When 94-142 came along, we saw it as a great step forward because it meant the school systems would begin to have to be involved in educating children who we felt should have remained in school systems, but because school systems were not able to do it, ended up at Crotched Mountain. It gave us the opportunity to move kids back into education in the much more comfortable environment of their home and community, who should have been in their home and their community being educated. We continue to work with those who really needed some special attention. 
So the issue of special education is something I have had a lot of personal involvement with. I think that 94-142 is a bill with really strong decisions made by this legislature over the years in the area of education. But as part of that concept, there was an element of sharing of the effort. Originally, when it was passed, 40 percent of the cost of special education was going to be borne by the Federal Government, the balance being borne by the local communities and the State. This was a reasonable cost-sharing concept. 
Unfortunately, over the years, although the bill itself continues to work and kids are getting educated, the cost sharing has not occurred. The Federal Government's participation in helping to bear the burden of educating children who have special needs has dropped to about 7 percent, or did drop to about 7 percent a year and a half ago. That meant that the local communities and the States have had to step in and pick up the Federal share of the cost. 
What has this done? Unfortunately, it has perverted the process. The practical effect of this is not only that the Federal Government has not come up with the dollars that have been owed the local communities, the practical effect has been in two ways extraordinarily detrimental. First, it has meant that the special-needs child and their parents have found themselves in a constant confrontation--almost, in many instances, an actual confrontation, but certainly a tension with the parents of children who are not special-needs children and with the school boards, because the demand to educate and the cost to educate the special-needs child is in many instances so high. 
I know of a number of instances in New Hampshire where special-needs-children costs have been upward to $100,000. It is certainly not unusual for it to be in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. That has meant that resources which parents of children who are not special-needs children felt was available to them, in many instances, because of the need to pick up the Federal cost, have had to go to benefit the special-needs child, because we are dealing, in many instances, with a pie that could not be expanded, and therefore the slicing of the pie ended up with the special-needs child obtaining, appropriately, a significant support level. But because the Federal Government was not coming in and paying its fair share, the support level for other children in the school systems dropped off or was less--maybe not dropped off, but was less than what was, many people 
thought, needed. 
So this tension occurred and it does occur and it still exists out there. I know in my own school systems in New Hampshire it still exists, and it is difficult on the parents. It is hard enough on the parents to have a special-needs child. It is more difficult when you put them in the position of being faced with this controversy over how the funds are being allocated in the school system. So that was one of the detriments of this failure of the Federal Government to live up to what it said it would do. 
The second detriment of the Federal Government's failure to living up to what it said it would do, it perverted the tax base of many communities. I know in my State and throughout New England, and it may be true in other parts of the country, real estate taxes pay a tremendous percentage of the costs of education. What happens when the Federal Government fails to come forward with its full share of the special-education need, then that means that cost falls back on the property tax owner, the homeowner in the community, who is already under significant stress with the tax burden. This, again, creates tension, an inappropriate tension, between the homeowners and the communities, and property taxpayers in the communities who maybe do not have schoolchildren, and particularly special needs children, and the school system itself, which sees needs that it feels it has to pay for, but it does not feel it can go back to the property tax owner or to the State tax treasury for. In many States, that may be the effect. You have an intense confrontation in many areas, and the intensity of it is undermining the confidence in the school systems and the quality of the school systems and, unfortunately, the character of the school systems as a positive environment which the community has supported in many areas. 
So, that, again, is almost a direct function of the Federal Government's failure to pay its fair share. Why do I say that? Because in New Hampshire, in the average school district in New Hampshire, 20 percent of the costs of the school districts go to special education--20 percent--and New Hampshire may be low compared to other States. I think in Massachusetts it is somewhere around 30 percent. However, what you can see when the Federal Government fails to come forward and pay its fair share of that cost, of that 20 percent, is that has a disproportionate impact on the community, on the students, and on the tax base. 
So what we have here is the Federal Government having created an obligation--and an inappropriate obligation--on the communities and States, having said it would fund that obligation at the level of 40 percent, but only funding it at the level of 7 percent, 2 years. We are getting that amount up a little bit because of efforts made by the leader, Senator Lott, but not up enough. 
So we have probably the single largest unfunded mandate of the Federal system outside of the environmental area in this area of special education. One of the primary commitments of the Republican Congress was that we would stop unfunded mandates. So as an effort to do that, we passed as a Congress--and I think it was passed almost unanimously, so we had bipartisan support--a bill that was authored by Senator Kempthorne from Idaho, was passed during the last session, and that bill said there would be no more unfunded mandates, or if there were unfunded mandates, it would take a supermajority to pass, in most instances, or at least we have to have full disclosure. 
Well, I think that should apply to reauthorizations, and especially reauthorizations which are essentially a creation of a new approach, in many ways, to the law. 
On the balance of what we have already done as a Congress, clearly, we have an obligation to live up to the 40 percent, but more importantly, we have an obligation to live up to it because it is needed, it is appropriate, and it is the right thing to do. 
I have offered this amendment, which I brought forward today, which essentially will get us to the 40 percent. While it does not get us there immediately, it gets us there, I believe, by the year 2004. It is a scaling up, and I believe with some of the incentives for a little more efficiency which this bill puts in place, especially in reducing, hopefully, some of the attorney's fees and consultant fees, that we will be able to reduce some costs in special education and, at the same time, be increasing the Federal share. 
I believe that, as a result of those two functions, we will get to the 40 percent level, which is the goal we should attempt to obtain here. 
Let me tell you a little bit of the history of the funding of this issue. Last year, we considered this to be so important that as we completed the omnibus appropriations bill, Senator Lott, to his credit--and he never got much credit for it, which I thought was ironic--insisted that as part of the settlement with the White House, we would put an additional $780 million into special education. That brought the special education total to about $3 billion. That was a major step forward. That meant significant, new, or additional dollars in special education. But it only meant that we essentially went from 6 or 7 percent up to about 8, 8.5 percent of the funding levels of the special ed cost for the country. So we are still well below the 40 percent we should be at. But at least we put our dollars where our talk was and we showed that we were willing to make that decision as a Republican Congress. We were willing to put dollars on the table in support of special education. We didn't get any credit for it. In fact, during the election, in many instances, we were rather vilified by our position on education by some of our opposition. But the fact is that we have been there with dollars and commitment. 
Now, as this Congress began, I thought the President would want to join us in this effort. I regret to say that he has not. He has put forward a lot of funding initiatives in education. He has talked about them everywhere. Obviously, he has made education a priority. But for some reason, in doing that, he has overlooked, ignored, what is the primary Federal education obligation today in the elementary and secondary school system, which is special education funding. As he has created all these new programs for educational funding, he has failed to, in any significant way, go back and fulfill our obligation of the 40 percent. In fact, his budget proposed only an additional $141 million. That is a lot of money, but in the context of what we are talking about relative to the cost of special education, it is really a very, very, very insignificant commitment, especially when you consider the fact that he is talking multiple billions--somebody said it was $30 billion--of new funding for education and discretionary accounts over the term of the next budget cycle. That may be high, but we know it is a very big number. It hasn't been settled, but it is a huge number. 
So it didn't surprise me, really, that he failed to put this on his list of issues that should be addressed, because this is an obligation the Federal Government presently had. So it is my belief that before we start--most of these educational issues are new initiatives--before we start creating a new obligation for the Federal Government in education that we are going to do this, this and that for the public, we ought to fulfill the obligation we made back in 1976, which was that we would fund 40 percent of the special ed need, an obligation which not only should we fulfill because we said we would by law, but because it is the right thing to do and because it works. Special needs kids who go through the system learn and they participate in the mainstreaming of education, and they have an opportunity to have a better lifestyle. 
So if you want to help education, this is a great way to do it. Not only would it help a special needs child, but, equally important, if we fully fund the 40 percent of special education accounts, we will, in fact, be helping education at the elementary and secondary school level dramatically because we will be infusing a significant amount of funds into a system that is under strain right now, according to the President, and I believe it is, also. 
Those funds will give the local school systems new flexibility in order to address other needs of the school system because, under this bill, one of the positive aspects of this bill is after we get to a certain funding level, which we haven't quite reached yet, local communities will have a chance to take a percentage of the special needs dollars and apply them for other educational activity, which is the way it should be, because, right now what is happening is that the local dollars are being used to fund the Federal share. When the Federal Government starts to fund its share, the local dollars should be freed up to fund other educational initiatives, those which are important in the community. That is the concept of this bill, in part. So this attempt to fully fund the special needs program is critical, not only to help the special needs child but also to free up the funds and give the local school system some flexibility as to how they address the coming years of cost and expense and education of our children. 
So this amendment that I am offering today, which has broad bipartisan support, is a statement of our belief as an authorizing committee that we shall pay the obligations of the special ed bill as it was originally intended. We don't get there immediately. We propose about a $1 billion increase this year, followed by a billion and a half or so each year thereafter until we get to approximately the 40 percent level. We need this authorization, obviously, in order to give the 
appropriating committees the directions that will allow them to make the proper allocation for the new education dollars that are going to be flowing. If the appropriating committee does not see from the authorizing committee that we consider this to be a priority, then the appropriating committee may want to put the money somewhere else. But, obviously, this is a priority for us. 
This has been a key piece of legislation. The chairman has worked on this and has been committed to this for years. The Senator from Iowa has an equal commitment, as do the members of the committee. Of course, the majority leader, through actions last year and through the involvement of his chief of staff this year, has shown his tremendous commitment. 
I should mention one other item relative to commitment from the Republican side. The Republican Congress and the Senate listed the top 10 issues that we intend to pass in this session. The No. 1 bill that we put forward, S. 1, was a bill that called for funding for special education exactly in line with this amendment. So this amendment is essentially an assertion of what is the Republican senatorial conference's position relative to funding special education and has been rated the No. 1 priority of this Republican Congress by its designation as Senate bill 1. 
So let me conclude there. But first let me make a couple of points. I want to, again, note what the chairman noted, which is that the Senator occupying the chair now, the Senator from Tennessee, was the energizer of this effort. He put thousands of hours, I suspect, or hundreds anyway, into this effort last year and did an extraordinary job of getting us almost to the finish line--close enough so that it was able to be crossed this year. Second, I thank the chairman for his excellent effort in this area. He has been a committed individual in the area of education and all of the aspects of education, as we know, for many years. This is another in the long list of successes he has had. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to submit, for myself and Senator Smith of New Hampshire, a Senate resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that individuals afflicted with breast cancer should not be alone in their fight against the terrifying disease. With Mother's Day coming up this Sunday, May 11, it seems especially appropriate that we recognize the extent to which our society is affected by this disease, as well as the importance of supporting breast cancer patients and their family members and friends who are all meeting the challenges of this disease at the side of their loved one. 
In 1997, it is estimated that 1 out of every 8 women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime and nearly 44,000 individuals will die of the disease this year. In New Hampshire alone there are 12,700 women living with breast cancer, and 230 women are expected to die of this terrible disease in 1997. With each of these individuals come loved ones who are also impacted. It is imperative to have a strong support system not only for individuals with breast cancer but for the family and friends who make up their support system. Our recognition of the millions of people who are dealing with similar struggles can help both the breast cancer patients and their loved ones to stay strong during their times of need. 
With this resolution, we hope to encourage an environment in New Hampshire, and across the Nation, where support is provided to both the individuals with breast cancer as well as their family and friends through public awareness and education, and where family members and loved ones of individuals with breast cancer support each other in along with the individual facing breast cancer.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to raise a couple of points here as we move through the budget negotiations. There are ongoing negotiations with the White House relative to trying to reach a budget agreement. But those negotiations deal with a budget that will run through the year 2002. My concern is that, as we look at a budget in that short timeframe, action which we take to address a budget that would reach balance by 2002 would have impact beyond that period, obviously, because we will put in place decisions that 
are not going to end at the time that budget concludes in 2002, but it will affect spending beyond that time. 
In two major accounts, the President's budget, as proposed, is basically a budget that has a low initial cost but has a dramatic, explosive cost in the outyears when you get past the year 2002. Both in the Medicare account and the Medicaid account, the President's budget, as sent up here, has significant increases in spending, but those increases in spending that are for the 5-year timeframe running through 2002 are really minuscule compared to the spending that will occur in the period after 2002. I believe this needs to be highlighted because, if it is not, I am afraid we will adopt initiatives in the President's budget that come out of it as part of this process of building our own budget and reaching a bipartisan budget. 
I am concerned that we will adopt initiatives that will cost us dramatic amounts of money outside the budget window and, once again, aggravate the real problem that confronts the country. We would be passing on to our children a country with huge debts of obligation that our children will never be able to pay. 
Let me highlight this in specifics. Under the President's proposal for Medicare, there is $33 billion in new spending during the budget window, through the year 2002. When you go beyond the year 2002 to the period of the next 4 years--this is a 4-year period, and it would run past that, obviously--there will be an explosion in the cost of those new programs. Those new programs, which cost $33 billion in the next 4 years, in the 4 years after that will cost $93 billion in new spending. That represents a 182-percent increase over the 5-year period. That is in the Medicare accounts. 
Some of these new programs involve the following--and I agree they are probably programs which we all feel would be nice. But the question is: Can we afford them? Can we afford to pass them on to our children? Can we afford to pass $93 billion in new spending on to our children, which is outside the budget window? Some of the new programs include: A new initiative in the area of cancer screening, for $2.5 billion; a direct payment to hospitals, outside of AAPCC, $26 billion; changing the way the Medicare accounts for the part B, 20-percent charge, which accounts for $42 billion; and a whole list of other new initiatives, all of which add up to $93 billion in spending that is outside the budget window, and is new spending for new programs and which will have to be paid by the taxpayers of this country, and, if not, borrowed from our children. In either event, it will aggravate the balance in the Medicare trust fund and continue to drive the Medicare trust fund toward insolvency. 
The second area the President has taken the same course of action on is in the area of Medicaid. In the Medicaid accounts, he has proposed $16 billion of new spending during the budget period between 1998 and the year 2002. But that $16 billion in new programmatic spending that occurs in the first 5 years explodes in the next 4 years to $34 billion, for a 113-percent increase. That is a 113-percent increase over the initial spending period--another explosive expansion of an entitlement program through the process of adding new benefits. In this area, we are talking about new benefits for disabled, illegal immigrants, and new benefits for children of illegal immigrants. And so you have this dramatic increase in spending. When you combine these two proposals--the President's proposal in Medicare and the proposal in Medicaid--the new spending accounts aggravate and compound the problem even more dramatically. 
You see here that in the next 5 years, which is the budget period the President sent us on this, there is $49 billion in new spending in Medicare and Medicaid accounts. As you move into the outyears, that $49 billion translates into $127 billion in new spending, or a 159-percent increase because of new programmatic activity. Now, what we are talking about here--and this needs to be stressed--is new programmatic activity. We are not talking about maintaining the Medicare trust fund or Medicaid trust funds; 
we are talking about adding to that program. 
Mr. President, we are talking about increased spending as a result of brandnew programs. So as we move down this road of trying to reach agreement on this budget, I think we have to be very sensitive that we not add a lot of new programs that may look affordable over the next 4 or 5 years, but which, in the outyears, becomes totally unaffordable and further aggravates what is already a very serious situation, because we know the Medicare trust fund is going bankrupt in 2000 and this will only aggravate that. All of these costs, if passed on to our children, may end up making their capacity to have a prosperous and productive country much less. This must be focused on as we go down the road to reaching a budget agreement. 
I yield back such time as I may have left. I appreciate the Senator from Nevada allowing me to speak at this point, during the time of the Democratic leader.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce important and unique legislation known as the Women's Investment and Savings Equity Act, or the WISE bill. 
As chairman of the Republican Task Force on Retirement Security, I have worked with other task force members to explore various ways that the Federal Government might better facilitate adequate savings for retirement. I am extremely pleased that Majority Leader Lott convened this task force, and asked me to lead it, because the problem of ensuring adequate retirement savings has been one in which I have become increasingly engaged. I am extremely pleased to have had the assistance and cooperation of all of the other Senators in the task force. 
We are currently in the process of drafting a comprehensive package of legislation designed to increase retirement saving through a diverse variety of means. However, one of these legislative initiatives, the WISE bill, has struck us as being so important that it warrants separate introduction and action. I am very proud of this legislation, and I am gratified to see the rapid growth in support for it. 
One thing has become ever more clear in the course of our work: this Nation must increase retirement saving--at every level--in order to meet retirement needs in the 21st century. 
The problem for women is particularly severe. They live longer than men, and they have less saving. As a result, they are almost twice as likely as men to spend their retirement years in poverty. 
If you wan to see a demonstration of why it is important that we permit greater saving by women in their own name, all that you must do is to review the poverty rates for widows and divorcees. Overall, elderly women have a poverty rate of 15.7 percent. For men, the level is 8.9 percent. Divorcees suffer poverty rates of 29.1 percent, widows 21.5 percent. For too many women, it is the case that they enter their elderly years, after devoting much of their lives to raising a family, only to find themselves alone and without sufficient means of financial support. That is not right. 
Current law has an unequal impact on women because they are more likely to interrupt their periods of paid employment in order to raise children. When they finally do return to the work force, and when they finally may have surplus money for saving, the law places tight limits on what they can contribute towards their own retirement. 
We shouldn't force women to choose between attentive parenting and saving for retirement. Women shouldn't be more likely to enter poverty in retirement simply because they have taken time out from work to raise a child. 
Our legislation would do three things: 
First, it would strengthen the homemaker IRA law. We would permit homemakers--and other workers without a pension--to make deductible contributions to IRA, regardless of whether their spouse participates in a pension plan. 
This is good for saving. It is also good for women; we shouldn't deprive homemakers of the opportunity to save on the basis of their spouse's participation in a pension plan. This is an idea that already has broad bipartisan support. 
Second, we would permit catch-up contributions to 401(k) retirement plans--and other types of elective deferral plans--for 
parents who miss time from work for maternity or paternity leave. 
Under current law, if an individual goes on unpaid leave from work for service in the National Guard or certain other military service, they may make `catch-up' contributions to their 401-(k) or similar retirement plans for the time that they missed. 
We would make similar `catch-up' contributions available to cover the employee portion of contributions that would have been made by parents had they not gone on parental leave. This is good savings policy, and good family policy. 
Third, and this is the most creative aspect of the legislation: We would create higher contribution limits--in `catch-up years'--for parents who have returned to work after a long period of nonparticipation in a pension plan. 
Consider a too-familiar story: A woman spends 15 years working at home, raising a family. Or--and let me stress that our provision applies in this case, too--maybe she works part-time, but she cannot contribute to a pension plan because she needs that money for day care. Either way, she spends a large amount of her life, unable to contribute to a pension plan. 
If she returns to the workforce at age 45 or 50, and her children are `out of the nest,' perhaps only then does she have surplus money to put into retirement savings. But current law is inflexible; she can't `catch-up' for the lost years. She is limited by a short number of working years, and tight annual limits on what she can contribute. 
Our legislation would simply do the following: For every year that you are unable to participate in a pension plan, and during which you are caring for a dependent child, you may take that number of `catch-up' years when you return to plan participation. 
During that catch-up year, you can make your normal allowed contribution to a 401-(k) or similar plan, and you can make an additional contribution of equal size to `catch-up' for a missed year. You can do this for up to 18 years. 
Working people have been telling us that they need some flexibility in being allowed to `catch-up' for missed opportunities to save. Not everyone has the money to save when they are 25. The problem is most severe for parents--for mothers. The least we can do is to make the law flexible enough to permit additional retirement contributions when they can afford it. 
These issues are not abstractions. For too many women, this is how life works. Maybe they suddenly become widows, or they go through a divorce. And they have forever lost their opportunity to generate saving in their own name. We see the results in the comparatively large number of women in poverty. 
This legislation would build additional flexibility into the law so that women--and all parents--are not penalized for making the choice to raise a child. 
Current law assumes that you have the same opportunity to save in every year of your life. That is just not so. Families with children often find it very difficult to save money, and this legislation would give them a chance to catch up when they reach a point where they at last can save. 
I believe this legislation is worthy of favorable consideration by the Senate. I also believe that prospects are good that we can pass at least a version of it. The chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, has contributed his valuable support, as has the chairman of the Labor Committee, Senator Jeffords. With the support of the leadership, and the support of the appropriate committee chairmen, I believe there is a basis for optimism that such overdue reforms will be passed by the Senate.

Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his excellent statement, which sets the premise for this hour of discussion that has been reserved relative to the proposal by the administration and the President and the Vice President to unilaterally take control over what is clearly a legislative prerogative and determine, unilaterally, that 89 percent--89 percent--of the work force in this country which would participate in Federal jobs will no longer be able to participate in those jobs. That is the practical effect of this proposal which is being put forward by the President and which was announced by the Vice President, was announced by the Vice President at a convention of a building trades union. 
One could be cynical and say, `Well, the building trades unions in the last campaigns spent $35 million reported'--we suspect maybe it may be closer to twice that unreported--`spent $35 million reported for the purposes of electing this President and that therefore this decision by the President to exceed his authority, as announced by the Vice President, is a return of that favor.' One could be cynical and one would be accurate, I suspect, in making that statement. 
But as the Senator from Georgia has pointed out, this goes well beyond the cynicism of this administration, which has already been displayed in a most significant way in a variety of other instances relative to campaign financing and fundraising and what will be done by this administration to benefit people who contribute to them. It goes well beyond that cynical approach and abuse of power which has become almost a hallmark of this administration. It goes to the essence of the separation of powers on which our Government is structured. 
This Congress is the Congress of the people. It is the Congress which is elected by the people. You may agree with it. You may disagree with it. But the fact is that the membership of this Congress is sent here for the purpose of writing the laws which govern the people whom we represent. 
As the Senator from Georgia has so adequately pointed out, the President's power in the legislative process is that of a negative, not of a creator of that law. In fact, ironically, the President does not even participate as a negative on some of the most significant laws that affect this country. 
For example, the budget of the United States is not signed or vetoed or subject to signature or veto by the President of the United States. It is purely a law driven by the body of the people of this country, which is the Congress. When a decision is going to be made to disenfranchise 89 percent of the people who presently participate in working for the Federal Government as contractors, that cannot be unilaterally done by the executive branch. That is a decision of such weight and of such importance that it is reserved clearly to the House of the people and to the Senate of the United States. And yet, this President has decided to do that and to, by fiat, by an arbitrary decision, put together who knows what. 
It certainly was not put together through the process of a legislative hearing. It was not put together through a process of a legislative debate. It was not put together through a process of a legislative vote in a committee, and a legislative vote on the floor of the Senate, and a legislative vote in the House, and a legislative conference, creating a bill which is sent to the President. 
No, it was put together by somebody sitting in a back row, writing an idea which was given to the Vice President of the United States, who went to a labor union annual meeting and announced, `This will be the new law of the land.' That is not the way we govern in a democracy. 
For that reason, I strongly support the initiative today put forward by our leader in the Senate, Senator Lott, which, said as I understand, the nomination of the Secretary of Labor shall not be brought before the body until this matter is cleared up, because that is our prerogative. That is our legal right as a representative of the people to advise and consent on the nominees for Cabinet positions. That is a legal and constitutional right. We have the legal and constitutional right to limit our advice and consent, and to not approve a member of this Cabinet, or to approve a member of the Cabinet. 
In this instance, we certainly have a right to hold up that nomination until this arbitrary act of excess on the part of the executive branch, done for whatever reason, is clarified and withdrawn. And, in fact, it would be my view that we should hold up probably just about every nomination which the administration wants to proceed with, because if they are not going to proceed in good faith in governing, if they are going to proceed in a manner which clearly exceeds the bounds of authority of the executive branch, then it is incumbent upon us as the legislative branch, as the branch elected by the people, to govern and to legislate, to make it clear to the President that that type of action will not be tolerated and cannot be tolerated if we are to maintain a constitutional democracy, a democracy built on the concept of checks and balances, a democracy which was designed by Madison and has survived so well for so many years. 
The issue has been laid out. The fight has been joined. I believe this Congress must assert its prerogative to retain its right as a legislative body of the people of this country. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this past weekend we had a weekend of firsts. Tiger Woods became the youngest PGA player to ever win the Masters and in doing so broke the all-time scoring record of 270 and established the largest margin of victory--12 shots--in the tournament's 61-year history. 
On April 14, 1997, the Tax Foundation announced another first, Tax Freedom Day this year will be on May 9. 
What is Tax Freedom Day? Tax Freedom Day is the day when the average American stops working for the Government and starts working for themselves. This year's record date for Tax Freedom Day of May 9 is 2 days after last year's record of May 7 and up significantly since the Clinton administration took office in 1993. 
This year the average American will have to work a total of 128 days to pay his or her tax bill. That equates to 2 hours 49 minutes of each working day laboring to pay taxes. That's hard time any way you slice it. 
Over the years, April 15 has metamorphosized from being a trip to the dentist's office to being a major root canal without the novocaine. 
I rise today to introduce legislation that will change the date on which individuals file their Federal income tax returns from April 15 to May 9, Tax Freedom Day. 
While this legislation does little to bring about a change in the amount of money paid by the average American wage earner, I believe that issue would be helped greatly with the enactment of a balanced budget with tax relief. It does ensure that your taxes won't be due until you free yourself from crushing Federal taxes. 
I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be placed in the Record.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in introducing the Occupational Safety and Health Modernization Act. Let me say at the outset that in proposing and considering OSHA reform, worker safety was my first concern. I am firmly committed to ensuring a safe and healthy workplace and will not support legislation which puts that in jeopardy. I believe in this bill that I have accomplished a true modernization of OSHA without compromising the safety of our workers in any way. 
Throughout my career in public office, I have worked to make government more efficient and more user and consumer friendly. Federal Government agencies have grown so large and become so bureaucratic that they are often not providing the kinds of personal services and proper oversight that was originally intended when they were created. Too often Government carries a heavy stick, but no carrot, when it interacts with individual citizens and businesses throughout our country. 
I believe that it is high time we take a close look at how we can improve the way government works and, at the same time, provide incentives for the private sector to act more responsibly. Americans will be better served in a climate where people in government, and in business, can work together to solve problems in a spirit of cooperation, rather than in an atmosphere strictly of threats, intimidation, and punitive measures. 
When OSHA was enacted, its intended purpose was to make the workplace free from `recognized hazards that are causing, or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to * * * employees.' As is the case with many programs established by Congress over the years, OSHA has developed a well-earned reputation for over-regulation. OSHA has moved from its original purpose of protecting workers to hindering businesses with excessive mandates. 
While I feel that much of the problem within OSHA is of a cultural nature, the bill we are introducing today will concentrate on relieving OSHA's oppressive and burdensome regulations, thereby removing a feeling among American employers and employees that OSHA is the `bad cop.' My legislation puts in place partnerships for assuring safety and health in the workplace. 
This balanced approach will include a consultation program, voluntary compliance and third party certification, employee involvement, warnings in lieu of citations for nonserious violations, and reduced penalties for nonserious violations. This legislation will use incentives, rather than penalties, to enhance workplace safety. It will allow companies with clean safety records to implement their own health and safety programs.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I introduce the Family Forestland Preservation Tax Act of 1997 on behalf of myself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. D'Amato, Ms. Collins, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire. This bill amends several key tax provisions to help landowners keep their lands in long-term private forest ownership and management. Without these changes, many landowners will continue to be forced to sell or change the use of their land. 
This bill derives from four years of work by the Northern Forest Lands Council [NFLC]. The NFLC was created in 1990 to seek ways for Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York to maintain the traditional patterns of land ownership and use in the forest that covers this Nation's Northeast. The Northern Forest is a 26-million-acre stretch of land, home to 1 million residents and within a 2-hour drive of 70 million people. Nearly 85 percent of the forest is privately owned. Times have changed, however, and social and economic forces have begun to affect the traditional patterns of land use with more and more land being marketed for development. 
This bill will help maintain traditional patterns and, thus, preserve the forest by adjusting several estate tax provisions. This bill would allow heirs to make postmortem donations of conservation easements on undeveloped estate land and allow the valuation of undeveloped land at current use value for estate tax purposes if the owner or heir agrees to maintain the land in its current use for a period of 25 years. This bill also would establish a partial inflation adjustment for timber sales by allowing a tax credit not to exceed 50 percent. This will encourage landowners to maintain their timberland for long-term stewardship, which is both economically and environmentally desirable. Also, the bill would eliminate the requirement that landowners generally must work 100-hours-per-year in forest management on their forest properties to be allowed to deduct normal management expenses from timber activities against nonpassive income. Currently, landowners are required to capitalize these losses until timber is harvested. This legislation, though prompted by the NFLC's work, will benefit not only the four states that make up the Northern Forest, but also all States with forest land and all who enjoy the multiple uses of forest land. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, which will not only protect the historic current use patterns, but also allow the rustic beauty of our forests to be enjoyed by all.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak about a series of initiatives that I have introduced to try to address what I see as the major public policy concerns as we move into the next century, on the fiscal side of the ledger, that affect people in their lives. 
As we move out of the 20th century, we have seen a period where, certainly throughout most of the 20th century, there was a sense that, through a centralized Government, through an economy dominated by a Government, you could manage the lives and affairs of individuals and improve their lifestyle. Of course, the most exaggerated example of this was communism and the Russian revolution, which began the major Communist state of this century or any time. And it did not work. One of the great truths of the 20th century, of which there have been about three, one of the great truths is that communism--the concept that the state can manage the marketplace and make people better off by requiring that people function under a top-down system where their lives and their style of economic production is controlled by a central mechanism--simply does not function effectively. Instead of producing prosperity, it produced despair. Instead of producing freedom, it produced totalitarianism. 
So, one of the great truths that has come out of this century is that capitalism works, that the free market works, that giving the individual the incentive to be productive, by allowing the individual to retain a large amount of the product of their work, is something that produces prosperity for the individual and, as a result, produces prosperity for society. And a prosperous society is a freer society, we have also learned that. That is the second truth. 
Yet, our Government continues to function, even here in the United States, with a hybrid of the theory that a centralized decisionmaking process can handle major social and economic issues more effectively than the marketplace can handle them or the individual can handle them. In the 1930's and 1940's, we as a nation, our intellectual community, especially the Northeastern intellectual community, was caught up in the concept that you could manage almost every major social and economic problem from the top down. We were caught up in the concept that a few good minds put together in a room, thinking, could resolve issues of major concern for the society at large, especially fiscal issues. 
This led to a centralization of decisionmaking here in Washington throughout the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's, which reached its peak in the early 1970's, and gained momentum from that peak throughout the 1970's until the arrival of Ronald Reagan, who said, `Let's stop and think a minute as to what we have done here and whether it has been successful.' 
The conclusion was that many of the decisions to centralize the process of policymaking in the hands of a few here in Washington simply was not working, that it was not producing a resolution to the problems that were at the core of our society, and especially it was not helping the prosperity of the Nation and individuals who lived in the Nation in many ways. So, we have, as we move toward the end of this century, come to the conclusion that maybe a centralized Federal Government is not all that effective in solving all of our problems; maybe we should slow the rate of growth of this Government and return authority to the people and to the States. And that, really, is what the Republican revolution has been about. 
If we take that as true, and I do happen to believe that is one of the things that has been proven by time, now--it is not a question of philosophy or theory any longer, it is a time-tested, proven event--then we still have some major issues to address, 
because some of the most significant social/fiscal issues which we have as a country today are still being driven in their policies as to how they are resolved by these concepts which came out of the thirties and the forties and the fifties of centralizing the decision in Washington and making the process of addressing those decisions a Washington-driven one. 
The three issues that are at the core of this, the three concerns that we as a society must have, from a fiscal policy standpoint--I am not talking about social policy; there are a whole set of other issues dealing with social policy--but from a fiscal policy standpoint of how Government deals with major issues, the three core concerns which we must have, as we head into the next century, are, one, how do we deal with Social Security; two, how do we deal with Medicare, which is a health care component for our senior citizens, and Medicaid; and three, our tax laws, how do we structure our taxes? 
All three of those issues, all three of those functions of Government which deal with the broad spectrum of the quality of life of a vast majority of Americans, are now dominated by a philosophy which grew out of the thirties, which was that a centralized, Government-decisionmaking process can better manage these systems than a decentralized, marketplace-driven approach. 
As a result, we have some chaos headed our way. We know that, under the present Social Security system, as a function of its present rate of return on investment and as a function of demographics, the system goes broke, taking the country with it, starting in about the year 2010. It goes broke in about the year 2020, but gets into what one might call a fiscal spiral beginning about the year 2017 which is not reversible. 
This is driven by the fact that returns on investment in Social Security dollars put into the trust fund have been extraordinarily low. They are basically a rate of return set by the Federal Government on special bonds given to the Social Security fund, which is where the Government borrows. 
Second, we have a population shift in this country, which is a function of the postwar, baby-boom generation, where we now have 3 1/2 people paying into the system for every 1 person taking out, and in the year 2012, we will have 2 people paying into the system for every 1 person taking out, and this cannot support the present benefit structure when you have such a change. 
In addition, there is the fact that people are living longer. When Social Security was first created, people lived to be 61. The time was set at 65. That was Franklin Roosevelt's choice. He was no slouch and understood actuarial tables. Today, people live to be, on the average, male, 72, female 78, and it is going up. 
So we have a Social Security system which we know is headed toward bankruptcy due to demographics and due to the fact there is no prefunded system. It is a pay-as-you-go system with a very low rate of return on the investment. 
Then we have the Medicare system, which is going broke, managed by the Federal Government. Basically, it is a Federal Government program, single manager, single opportunity for seniors. They have to buy fee-for-service delivery. They have to buy a certain set of benefit structures. That system is going to go broke in the year 2001 at the latest; probably in the year 2000, only 3 years from now. 
It is going to go broke because of the fact that it is a system which is using a 1960's model of health care delivery in the 1990's. It is a system which still relies on fee for service when, in fact, we know that in the marketplace today, very few people use fee-for-service health care. Most people choose some sort of fixed-cost, prepaid health care plan, whether it is a HMO, PPO, PSO, or whatever. They choose some sort of alternative rather than going out to a doctor on a cost-plus basis who refers you to another doctor on a cost-plus basis, then refers you to another doctor, which is what the present system does. 
It is a classic program which was designed by Government bureaucrats in the 1960's which was probably outdated even then, but which has clearly not been updated for the 1990's and is going to go broke in the year 2000 because it is not structured for these times. That is the second system which represents a major issue of fiscal policy. 
Between those two, Medicare and Social Security, they will be accounting, between them, for almost 50 percent of the Federal budget by the year 2000, and by the year 2017, if you throw in interest on the Federal debt, they will be counting for all the revenues of the Federal Government. That is their size and their impact under their present structure. 
The third issue, of course, is our tax laws. Our tax laws are, again, a centralized decisionmaking process where we in Washington, a group of elite in the Government, choose winners and losers in the marketplace. We choose that this type of market activity will be a benefit and that type of market activity will be penalized because, for some reason, we think we can think better than the marketplace and individuals can think on how they should invest their money, and tax laws are structured to be a top-down, centralized, essentially 
Government-driven exercise in managing the marketplace through the Government. Of course, nothing affects the prosperity of a country more than the level of taxation and the manner in which you tax. 
So my representation is this. I have put together a package of bills which I call the American productivity renewal package, which addresses these three core issues of fiscal policy from a marketplace approach, instead of using the dynamics which have dominated these policies since the thirties, which is a Government-driven approach and which is a centralized-planning approach. Instead of using that approach, which has clearly failed and which is predicted to be a catastrophic failure as we move into the next century, I am acknowledging the fact, the truism of the 20th century, which is that the marketplace, not the Government, is the primary provider of prosperity within a society. 
These three proposals which I put forward involve, first, in the Social Security area, that we recognize that you cannot have a pay-as-you-go system with an unfunded liability of $3 to $4 trillion and an aging population that is exceeding the ability of the working population to pay for it and expect that system to survive. So what we need to do is to create a better return for those younger people who are now paying into the system on their savings. We need to be able to say to the working American who is under the age of 45, `In order for you to get a decent Social Security retirement, we are going to have to have you earn more money on the dollars that you pay into Social Security and, more important, we are going to have to give you the ability to identify those dollars to yourself.' 
Today under Social Security, if you pay a dollar in, the dollar goes out. You have no account. There is no savings account which says, `Bob Smith' or `Mary Jones' on it. It is basically a dollar in, dollar out, and, as a result, you have this huge unfunded liability. 
We need to prefund that liability, No. 1, so that people can have their own savings account designated to themselves. And, second, we need to allow people to get a better return than what is presently occurring under the present system, which is about a 3 percent rate of return, which is not inflation adjusted, so if inflation is more than 3 percent, it is no return at all. We need to allow people to get a better rate of return. 
What my proposal does, in the Social Security area it says today Social Security is running a surplus. It is running about a $29 billion actual surplus. It actually has about a $70 billion surplus, but half of that is interest which the Federal Government is paying on debt, so it is, basically, paying interest to itself. 
But there is actually about a $29 billion real surplus in Social Security, which represents about 1 percent of the 7.5 percent payroll tax people pay. 
So what my proposal says is that, rather than paying a 7.5-percent payroll tax, people will only have to pay a 6.5-percent payroll tax. They will get that percentage back, that percent difference back. They will have the right to take that percentage difference and invest it in a savings account or some other vehicle that allows them to produce income for their retirement. 
It will have to be a retirement account, like an IRA. And the practical implications of that are two: No. 1, people will start to generate a nest egg for retirement that will be real, that they will be able to look at every year when they get their statement; it will be there, and it will be able to generate a better return than 3 percent. And, No. 2, it has no impact on present-day Social Security recipients or people who would be receiving Social Security who are over the age of 45, because we are now running a surplus and we could pay the cost of their Social Security benefits without impacting them with this type of private account. It is using the marketplace and recognizing that the marketplace must be used to prefund the liability of Social Security. 
In the area of Medicare, this package of bills does something called choice, where essentially we say to the senior citizen, rather than having a program where the Government tells you who insures you, we will give you a program where, like a Member of Congress or a Federal employee, you can go out and choose who would insure you. They would have to give you a certain set of benefits and the benefits will have to at least equal what you are presently getting under Medicare, but you will be able to choose the benefit package you feel best meets your needs--you, the senior citizen. You will not be limited to one choice or, at most, two choices, which, at present, the present Medicare Program has. 
Equally important, what we are going to say to the senior citizen is, today it costs, for example, $4,800 for a senior to be on Medicare. To the extent that a senior can go out and find a health care plan which gives the basic benefits of Medicare, maybe even more benefits, but gives it to them for less than $4,800--say, $4,500--we will let the senior keep the difference, or at least 75 percent of it, that $300 between $4,800 and $4,500. 
What does this do? It creates three marketplace forces which will lead to making the Medicare system more solvent. No. 1, it means the senior becomes a cost-incentive buyer of health care. They think about where they are going to buy their health care. Granted, people who are already in the system who are in their late 70's or 80's probably are not going to change. But you have a whole group of seniors coming into the system who have been used to looking at a variety of health care options, so they will be comfortable doing this. But getting that 75 percent back of your savings makes them cost-incentive buyers. 
No. 2, it will create a marketplace which will compete for the seniors' dollars. Because, believe me, there are a lot of health care providers who deliver high-quality health care who would be very excited about the chance to buy into this. 
And, No. 3, it gives the Federal Government a predictable rate of growth as to how much health care is going to increase in Medicare accounts. And we, in order to make the trust funds solvent, do not need to cut Medicare. All we need to do is slow its rate of growth to about 7 percent, 6.5 percent--what is now a 10-percent rate of growth. That rate of growth, by the way, is still twice the rate of inflation and a multiple of 5, possibly, the rate of health care inflation. 
So this creates a marketplace atmosphere around which Medicare would compete and around which seniors could participate in their health care system and which would control costs and which would give seniors more choices than they have today, more options in health care than they have today. It recognizes the fact that, you know, a 1960 system, where the Federal Government basically picks who you can have health care with, simply does not work. You have to use the marketplace. 
The third element of this American productivity renewal package is to look at the tax laws and acknowledge the fact that the tax laws are arbitrary. They are as arbitrary as some bureaucrat in Washington could possibly make them, or some Member of Congress could possibly make them. Why should somebody be a winner and why should somebody else be a loser under the tax laws? Simply because a Member of Congress or somebody at Treasury decided unilaterally to affect the marketplace by making the decision that this person will be a loser and this person will be a winner, that is not right. That perverts the flow of capital; it perverts investment; it perverts the manner in which people go out and make decisions in the marketplace. It causes an inefficient use of dollars that are used to create capital and create savings. 
So we need a flatter system. We need a system that eliminates the vast majority of the deductions and says to the taxpayer, `You can fill your form out on one page, one postcard, 
and in doing that, we won't control how you make decisions with your money. We'll take your taxes still, but we won't control whether or not you invest in this item or that item. That is simply a decision as to whether or not you're going to get better or worse tax treatment.' And, thus, capital will flow much more efficiently to those items which are most productive and those items which will create the most prosperity, because that is the way a capitalist system works and a marketplace system works. 
So by addressing these three core issues of fiscal policy from a marketplace approach as versus from a centralized planning approach, which is what has been done for the last half century, we can, I believe, ready ourselves for the next century, make this country more competitive, and, most importantly, put the country in a position where our children will be assured that we are going to be a fiscally solvent place and a prosperous place for them to raise their children, rather than a place subject to the vagaries of a huge Government debt and inflation that would cause a bankruptcy of the Social Security system. 
Mr. President, I appreciate your time. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue which has been raised by other Members on this floor, which I believe is of great significance and which must be resolved in the next few days. That is that the Clinton administration has a difficult matter of rendering a decision, in consultation with the Secretary of State, as to whether or not to certify Mexico as a nation that is cooperating in the area of our war on drugs. 
There are many factors to consider before making such a decision, but the primary factor for me is what effect does such a decision have on our ability to fight the use of drugs here in the United States? Drug abuse continues to be one of the primary serious problems, primary and most serious problems, our Nation is facing, especially among our young people in our inner cities. Fighting drugs has to be one of the most important goals of this administration and of this Congress. 
Since the so-called certification process was begun in the mid-1980's, Mexico has always been deemed to be a nation that is making a strong effort in the drug war, and many of us in Congress have had concerns, and continue to have concerns, about Mexico's progress. 
So at some point, you have to evaluate the effects of bestowing certification status on Mexico. Has certification improved Mexico's ability to deal with drug cartels? Have cocaine seizures increased? Are drug dealers being arrested and convicted? Are antimoney-laundering bills being enacted into law in Mexico? And finally, and perhaps most important, are the Mexican law enforcement agencies cooperating with us and are they free of corruption? 
It is this last point that I think remains the most single significant concern and impediment to certification. The arrest of the Mexican General Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, the Mexican drug czar in charge of Mexico's counternarcotics efforts, on a charge of bribery, cocaine trafficking and for having ties to organized crime leaders in Mexico's drug cartels, was, in the words of our own United States drug czar, General McCaffrey, a `terrible blow.' It really is more than that, of course. To have the chief law enforcement officer in the area of drug enforcement in Mexico turn out to be nothing more than a front man for the Mexican drug cartels undermines all credibility of the effort of Mexico in the area of fighting drugs. 
Our intelligence agencies are now conducting a damage assessment to establish how many of our agents, informants and counterdrug operatives were put at risk. It is believed that a very large number have been put at risk, and, in fact, the damage to this intelligence network may exceed the damage that was created in the CIA by the Aldrich Ames case. If you remember, in the Aldrich Ames case a large number of agents and operatives for the CIA died. 
When you add up the evidence about the results of certification, you have to wonder what effect it has had on stemming the flow of drugs into this country. Mexico is the source of 70 percent of the cocaine on American streets and is the growing source of the most violent types of drugs. The primary cartels which are now shipping their drugs to the United States are no longer centered in Colombia. They are two cartels centered in Mexico. The antimoney-laundering laws are incomplete and not yet implemented. In short, the battle against drugs being shipped to the United States from Mexico is being lost in Mexico. 
In light of the ongoing corruption and the flow of drugs into our Nation, I believe the United States must withhold full certification. The cost of drug abuse to our society remains too high to take any other course. There is no doubt that on the domestic front, we can do a great deal more, and we must. In fact, it was unfortunate that this administration essentially ignored this problem during its first term, but the administration has now turned its attention to this issue, and, hopefully, we can make greater progress. We need strong leadership from the White House. The President does control the bully pulpit and, as we saw with Mrs. Reagan's efforts under the `Just Say No' program in the eighties, the White House can have a dramatic effect on utilization. 
But at the same time, we must pursue a more effective policy that will cut off the flow of drugs from source countries like Mexico. I believe that withholding full certification to Mexico would send the right message from the American people to the Government of Mexico, and that message is that the status quo is not acceptable. I urge the President to hear the concerns of our agents on the front lines who cannot trust their Mexican counterparts for fear of being compromised. As the DEA Administrator, Mr. Constantine, stated, `There is not one single law enforcement institution with whom DEA has a really trusting relationship.' 
It is time, Mr. President, to take strong action, and I strongly suggest that we not pursue certification.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to also speak on another subject which is of equal importance. It is of importance, however, to the next generation in a different way. It is of importance in the area of fiscal policy, and that is the question of Social Security. 
There is an atmosphere, of course, which has pervaded American politics, and especially politics in Washington, that discussing substantive reform to Social Security laws of our country is to commit political hari-kari; that any discussion of Social Security must be done in the most passive and benign way or else a person in public office will suffer great consequence. 
But we can no longer afford to take this head-in-the-sand approach to this absolutely critical and core issue of public policy. We know that the Social Security system is fundamentally broken and that it is headed toward an enormous bankruptcy. We know that if we take no action, purely as a function of demographics, we will see a collapse of the Social Security system in the early part of the next century, and with it probably a collapse of our Nation's finances, as we will simply be unable to bear the load of paying for the system. 
This is not a result of having a failed system for the last 40 years. We have had an extraordinary system for the last 40 or 50 years. It is a result simply of the fact that the Social Security system was not structured to deal with the generational 
demographics which we are headed toward. The post-war baby-boom generation is going to turn the tables of productivity upside down and the tables of who gets and who gives relative to the Social Security system. 
Today, approximately 3.1 people pay into the system for every 1 person who takes out. By the time the post-war baby-boom generation is fully taking down its share of Social Security, we will only have two people paying into the system for every one person taking out. That means that by the year 2020, the Social Security system will be running approximately a $216 billion deficit which will be escalating in a geometric progression. 
This deficit will essentially absorb all the discretionary dollars of the U.S. Government, and we simply will be unable to fund the operation of Government, beyond either paying for Social Security or choosing some other course. What will happen is, we will have to create a massive economic disruption to address the issue, probably a national inflation on the order of what happened in the German Weimar Republic after World War I. 
So this issue must be addressed. It is like that television ad for an oil filter that says, `You can pay me now or pay me later.' By paying now, by doing something now, we can alleviate the problem for the next generation or reduce it dramatically at a low cost, but if we wait until later, the cost to the next generation will be astronomical, and we will not have fulfilled our obligation as passers of the torch. 
So I have proposed a piece of legislation which addresses this issue. I recognize that stepping into this water maybe doesn't make political good sense, but I happen to believe that if we do not step into this water, or if somebody doesn't begin to step into this water, nothing will happen. So I put on the table a proposal on Social Security, which I introduced last week, which addresses the underlying problems of the system. 
It has four basic elements, and, as a practical matter, it addresses the next generation--my generation--and younger people's generations as to how they will be impacted. It has very little significant impact on the people who are presently receiving benefits from the Social Security system. 
The first element of it, and probably the most magic, unique--I won't use magic, that will be too egotistical a term--the most unique is I am suggesting we take now what is presently the surplus in the system, which surplus we expect to run through the year 2010, and we refund that surplus to the wage earners. 
Today, $20 billion more is paid into the system than is paid out of the system for benefits. That means the wage earners in this country are paying $29 billion more in taxes than they need to pay under Social Security to support the Social Security system. 
My suggestion is that we refund that by reducing the payroll tax by that 1 percent, from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent, which works out to about 12 percent actually, but a 1-percent reduction. And we allow the wage earner to take that 1-percent savings and put it into a savings account, into a savings vehicle like an IRA or some other personal savings vehicle and invest it for their future. This would allow us to begin to prefund the liability of a system which is now subject to contingent funding. 
We now have a pay-as-you-go system. There is no account which is set up for anybody who is on Social Security. What is paid in today is paid out today. This would allow us to begin to prefund that liability and to give working Americans who are under the age of 50 an opportunity to start to save for their retirement. And it would do it without impacting at all--at all--the present benefit structure of senior citizens. 
In addition, we must acknowledge that our society is living longer and being more productive. When the Social Security system was officially created, the average life of an American male was 61, and the retirement age was set at 65. Franklin Roosevelt was no fool. Today, the average life expectancy of an American male is 72 and is moving toward 78. Retirement age remains 65. 
My proposal, for people who are under the age of 45, would scale up the retirement age and give them lead time to anticipate that. Again, it would affect nobody who is on the system or about to come on the system. 
In addition, I do something which is called changing the bench points, which is essentially affluence testing, not for people who are on the system today but people who are under the age of 45. 
These are some changes that would bring about a solvent system. They are different, but they are proposals that need to be put on the table and discussed. Mr. President, I thank the indulgence of the Chair.

Mr. GREGG. I thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for yielding me time on this nomination. I rise in support of this nomination of Congressman Richardson to be America's Ambassador to the United Nations. I had the pleasure of serving with Bill Richardson while he was in the House. We arrived at nearly the same time. 
He was a joy to serve with, and I have a lot of respect for what he has done since that time, especially in the area of international affairs where he has in a number of instances been able to extricate Americans from very difficult situations. 
However, on this issue of the nomination, I think we also need to address the question of the status of the United Nations and especially the relationship of this Government to the United Nations, and a few caveats need to be pointed out. 
Specifically, my concern, and I think the concern of a number of Members of Congress, is with the payment of arrearages to the United Nations. The administration, we hear by rumor, is going to send to this Congress a supplemental, which supplemental will include in it a $900 million plus request for payment of arrearages to the United Nations. 
There are two major issues raised by this. First, the question of whether $900 million is the correct number. There is some serious concern by those of us who have looked at this issue that that number may be too high and that the proper number should be less because we as a government have not received proper credit for costs of peacekeeping which we have incurred and should have been credited for. 
Second, independent of what the right number is relative to arrearages, there is the question of what the money will be spent for in the future. The United Nations has some very serious problems in its management. 
The new Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has made a commitment to try to address those problems, and we respect that commitment. But we need to go beyond verbiage. We need to go beyond language, and we need to have specifics, and we need to have enforceable and identifiable and ascertainable standards we can look to. 
Specifically, we need to have from the United Nations a system to review where the money is spent. There is not now available to those who wish to review, those member countries that wish to review, an effective accounting procedure for where the money goes once it arrives at the United Nations, and we need to have that. 
Second, we need to have an effective process for determining the personnel policies of the United Nations. There is not now a structure for adequately reviewing how personnel decisions are made at the United Nations. There is a legitimate concern that there are a significant number of political appointees at the United Nations, patronage, for lack of a better word, and that these appointees do vote in many instances. That is the representation. It may or may not be correct. But because there is no system to be able to review the personnel policies of the United Nations, because they do not have a systematic personnel policy system, it is impossible to evaluate the accuracy of these representations. 
Third, we need to have the process for evaluating the full services delivered by the United Nations, the programmatic initiatives taken by the United Nations and whether or not they are being efficiently and effectively handled. This is a very genuine concern because there is a very significant amount of anecdotal evidence, at least, that many of the activities and dollars that have been spent to support those activities may not have produced the results sought, or in many instances the dollars may have just been misplaced in at least a few cases that have been found by the present inspector general, even misappropriated. 
So until we get in place these three major accounting processes, which are typical of any major structure of government or of the private sector, an accounting structure for knowing where the money goes, an accounting structure for knowing what the personnel policies are, and an accounting structure that allows you to follow programmatic activity as to its efficiency and effectiveness, until we get something in place that shows us we are going to have those types of systems in place that allow us to review and know whether or not our dollars are being spent effectively, it is very hard for us as the fiduciaries of our citizens' dollars, as the managers of our taxpayers' hard-earned income that is sent here as taxes, to say to the United Nations you shall have this money in a carte blanche type of approach. 
So there will be a significant debate in the Senate, and I suspect in the Congress generally, as to how we structure any payment on arrearages, and it is going to be my position, which I intend to aggressively pursue--and it really is a position where I follow the lead of the chairman of the committee--that we have effective accounting procedures in place and that they be ascertainable and that they be structured in a way that we are sure we are getting our dollar's worth of effective administration, personnel management and services.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly this morning about the status of the President's budget. Obviously, this is always a very significant event when the President presents a budget. This year, I think the climate and the substance of the budget is significantly different than what has occurred in past years. There is a commitment by this Congress to get to a balanced budget by the year 2002. 
A year ago, we sent a budget that would have accomplished that to the President, and he, regrettably, vetoed it. Now the President has come forward and accepted this challenge and said that he also believes that we should get to a balanced budget by the year 2002. He sent up to us a proposal to accomplish that. His budget, as proposed, has many constructive functions in it. It also has many questions. Regrettably, it has a lot that is left undone and unaddressed. 
On the constructive side, he does get to a balanced budget --at least as he claims--using his numbers. Unfortunately, the questions that are raised by the way in which he gets there are significant. For example, next year, the deficit will go up and the following year the deficit will go up, under his budget. Even in the following year, the deficit goes up under his budget. It is not really until he is about to leave office that he alleges or represents he is going to put in place programs which would bring the deficit down. That, to me, is not what I would call a good glidepath to a balanced budget. The glidepath should be a downhill glidepath, not a roller-coaster graph. 
The President proposes about $258 billion of not cuts, but attempts to slow spending over the next few years. Of this, it appears that about $80 billion comes from defense, about $58 billion comes from domestic discretionary programs, and about $21 billion comes from entitlement issues. Those are good, solid numbers--well, not necessarily solid numbers, but good starting numbers, and we will see whether they are solid numbers. 
At the same time he is proposing $121 billion in savings over the next few years in the rate of growth of entitlements, he is also proposing $60 billion of new spending on entitlement programs, such as new Medicare benefits, Medicaid benefits, food stamp and SSI benefits, new health insurance benefits. And under his education initiative is a brand new entitlement program for school instruction, allegedly, and a brand new entitlement program for school literacy--$60 billion in new spending, 
which gives you basically a net in the entitlement areas over 5 years of $60 billion in reduction, which is not a very significant number. That is about $10 billion a year on entitlement spending which annually represents almost 55 percent of the Federal budget and is closing in on $700 billion. So it is not a big number. In fact, it is not a strong enough number in order to get to a solid balanced budget because what happens is that, even if we get to the balanced budget, even if we accept the figures which the President has proposed in his budget as getting to the balanced budget in the year 2002, we see those deficits exploding after that period. Why is that? Because there is no fundamental proposal for structural reform of the major entitlement programs in the President's budget. That is where I believe this budget is inappropriate. There has to be fundamental reform if we are going to honestly address this issue, if we are not going to simply pass it off onto the next administration, as would occur in this case, or the next Congress as might occur in our case, or, unfortunately, the next generation, which is exactly what we are doing as a Congress and a Presidency if we pursue a tentative course in addressing the entitlement reform. 
In the area of entitlement reform, there is in the President's budget no initiative to try to put in balance for any extended period of time the Medicare trust fund, part A, or the Medicare system. The President of the Senate today has been one of the leaders on the issue of how you can reform Medicare in a substantive way so we can have a strong insurance system for our seniors. 
I have also put together something called Medicare Choice, or Choice Care, which would be a substantive structural reform which would use the marketplace to try to create an incentive for efficiency in the Medicare system which would give seniors choices, much as we have as Members of Congress, to go into the marketplace and choose a variety of different health care programs, the type of structural reform which myself and the Senator from Tennessee, who is in the chair today, have talked about, are trying to energize and for which we have a lot of support, by the way, here in Congress. It is nowhere to be found in the President's proposal, nor is there any other structural reform which would address the underlying Medicare concerns to be found in his proposal; just a variety of traditional provider payment slowdowns and possibly an accounting mechanism that would significantly adjust the way we pay for home health care. Neither is there a long-term solution, but one which is a totally inappropriate accounting gimmick. There is no long-term solution as to how we make Medicare solvent. So the proposal does not address Medicare reform. 
The proposal also does not address the reform of our tax laws, which it should. It calls for a $98 billion cut in taxes. It also calls for an increase in taxes of about $76 billion. So essentially there is no tax cut in this package. More importantly, there is no attempt to address the underlying problem which our tax laws have. We just saw where the IRS spent $4 billion to put in place a computer system to try to make the tax system work in this country, and it appears it can't even figure out who is filing what returns when and how much they are owed. After spending $4 billion, the IRS has openly admitted that it has failed; $4 billion down the drain. Why is that? Is it because they cannot produce such a computer system? In large part, yes. More significantly, it is because our tax laws are so complex and convoluted that they are simply unenforceable and ineffective, and is not a way that we should be raising revenues for the citizenry. The IRS has become a totally overbearing and, in many instances, inept organization which the American people no longer have confidence in. That undermines constitutional government when your tax-raising organizations lose the confidence of the people. 
So there should be a proposal, or at least a discussion of or an initiative for how you reform the tax laws, how we take this great, huge, byzantine morass called the IRS and bring it into the 21st century and simply make it understandable and give the American people an opportunity to file a tax return on a postcard, pay taxes, and know that they are being accounted for correctly and recognize that we need more efficiency. 
So there is no proposal in here for fundamental tax reform, and there should be. The President has missed an opportunity. It is basically a budget which is based on optimistic economic assumptions, has in it new entitlement proposals for spending, and has a very low net tax cut, none of which really accomplishes the basic goals of the balanced budget. If we are going to balance the budget, we have to fundamentally reform the underlying drivers of our budget problem, which is the entitlement system and our tax laws. Yet, that is not addressed in this budget proposal. It is, however, a starting point. 
We as a Senate, and I as a member of the Budget Committee, intend to take it as such and to work with the President to try to put in place something that should not only lead us to a balanced budget in the year 2002 but will give us an opportunity at least to see some light at the end of the tunnel for a long-term resolution of the major underlying public policy questions which we have in this country--Medicare, Social Security, and our tax laws. 
So I appreciate the time, Mr. President, of the body. I yield back my time at this point.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak a little bit about the issue of education, which was raised so aggressively by the President in his State of the Union Address last night. I congratulate him, once again, for focusing the country's attention on this critical concern. It is something that we, as a nation, have focused our energies on ever since we began, and many could argue that one of the really unique miracles of American society has been our educational system. 
With each generation, we have asked ourselves, is our system working well, is it working right, is it producing individuals who are trained and capable of participating in the issues which their generation will face? In many instances, the answer has regrettably come back, no, maybe we aren't or we are not doing quite enough. 
I, for example, remember that in 1980, we had the report of `A Nation at Risk,' and that report identified as a country, because of our educational failings, we were falling behind, falling behind our sister nations in the industrial world in the area of educating our students and their capacity to compete, especially in areas such as science and math. So a major initiative was undertaken as a result of that. 
Then when I was Governor of New Hampshire back in 1988, President Bush had just been elected, and he proclaimed that he would be the education President and gathered, for the first time, I believe--maybe it was the second time in history--all the Governors in one location for the purpose of taking on a one-item agenda. That was in Charlottesville, VA, and the issue was education. 
At that time, Governor Clinton from Arkansas was, I believe, the chairman of the Governors conference and played a major role in identifying five major policies which would be the goals to get us to the year 2000 to improve our educational system. 
One of those policies involved being a leader in the world by the year 2000, I believe it was--it might have been earlier--in the area of math and science education. 
Now we have President Clinton coming forward and saying, again, and accurately so, that our educational system is not accomplishing what we need as a nation. It is not educating our children to the level that is necessary for us, as a nation, to compete. And so we revisit the issue. 
The question is, how do we revisit the issue? Do we learn from our mistakes of the past, or do we simply go forward with another new set of initiatives which may or may not accomplish our goals or may not accomplish more than what was accomplished in the last efforts. This is what I want to discuss, because I think the President, for all his energy and his enthusiasm and his rightly directed purpose, which is to improve education, has, to some degree, missed the point. 
There are a lot of issues of education, but there are parts of education which work well, and one of the core parts of education that works well is the ability to keep the control over education at the local level. The essence of quality education, the formula for quality education is not a formula which says dollars equal better education. It is a formula that has variables in it, including dollars, including teachers, including principals, including school boards. But that formula doesn't necessarily have as a major function in it--we are talking now about secondary and elementary education--the Federal Government deciding the purposes, the roles, the curriculums of education. Rather, the essence of that formula is that the local community, the teachers, the parents, the principals, the school boards collaborate to produce quality education. 
So the Federal role in education is narrow, because there 
could be nothing more disruptive or, in my opinion, nothing that would undermine education more fundamentally than to move the decision process out of the hands of the parents, out of the hands of the teachers, out of the hands of the principals to Washington. We would end up with a bureaucratic structure which would not respond to the needs of better education. 
No, the Federal role is narrow. It should be focused, focused on places where it can make an impact, and that is what we tried to do or attempted to do. Sometimes we tried to go beyond that. Basically, that is what we tried to do. The Federal role has been, for example, in postsecondary education. The Federal role is significant, important, and appropriate in assisting students in being able to move on past their high school years to higher education, and the President's initiatives in this area are something that we want to look at because they could be a valuable addition. 
The Federal role in the secondary school level has been really limited and focused to a couple of specific areas where we felt the Federal Government could play a major part--chapter 1, Head Start, and special needs students. 
But now the President comes forward and lays out a whole brand new set of initiatives, new spending programs, $43 billion in new programmatic activity, not pursuing programs that are on the books, but setting off on brandnew programs, and you have to ask yourself: First, how many of those programs are appropriate to the Federal Government and, second, and even more important, is that the best use of those dollars, because there is something that is missing here. 
At the local school level, the Federal Government has said you must educate the special needs child under Public Law 94-142. This was an excellent decision, that we require that the special needs child would be able to be educated in the least restrictive, most mainstreamed environment, and it has worked well. But when we passed that law, the Federal Government also said that we were going to be a partner in that education; that we, the Federal Government, because we were insisting that the local government undertake this role in the elementary and secondary schools, that we, the Federal Government, would pay for 40 percent of the cost of special education in this country. Today, the Federal Government doesn't pay for 40 percent of the cost of special education, it pays for approximately 6 percent, and the impact on the local school systems of the Federal Government not stepping forward and doing what it said it would do to assist in educating special needs students has been dramatic. 
We have seen a shift in resources at the local level which has been arbitrarily created because of the Federal Government's failure to live up to its responsibility. 
In the local schools in my State, for example, the local property taxpayer bears the burden of education primarily, and this is true throughout New England to a large degree, and many other States, I am sure. What happens is that because the Federal Government is unwilling to pay the 40 percent it said it would pay for a special needs student, the local property taxpayer has to pick up that 40 percent, or the difference between what the Federal Government is paying and what it said it would pay, which is about 34 percent. 
That has meant that resources which might have been used for the average student, maybe to have an extra art class or an extra language class or an extra math class, or might have been used for the athletic program or for the cultural programs in the school system or might have simply been left with the local property taxpayers so that they could meet their mortgage payments more easily or their car payments more easily, that money is going to educate the special-needs student. 
What we have created is a conflict, an inappropriate, unfair conflict, especially to the special-needs student, because what has happened is that in many communities where you have children who need special assistance, that special assistance is extremely expensive, and the parents of the students who are not special-needs students look at the parents of the students who are special-needs students and say, `Why is your son or daughter getting $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 spent on their education annually when my son or daughter is only having $3,000 or $4,000 or $5,000 spent on him or her?' `It's just not fair,' they are saying. 
So you have this conflict. And it is not right. There is no reason why that special-needs student should be separated out and find that they are looked upon in a jaundiced way by the community, by the other parents, and parents conflicting with parents, the school board conflicting with parents. 
The only reason it is occurring is because the Federal Government has failed to live up to its obligations on this special education. We said we would pay 40 percent of the cost of special education, and instead we are paying 6 percent. That has created this conflict at the local level, which has placed the special needs student in a really unfair and inappropriate position. 
You have to ask yourself, why do we do this? Why does the Federal Government do this? Well, it is called an unfunded mandate. 
The first act of the Republican Congress 2 years ago was to pass a bill, which I helped author but which was really energized and driven by the Senator from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, which said we will not pass unfunded mandates any longer. Unfortunately, this one is already on the books. It is the largest unfunded mandate in the education arena; maybe outside of a couple of environmental unfunded mandates, the largest unfunded mandate in the country. It has had this really perverse effect, both of the tax burden on the local communities and the States, but, more importantly, the relationship between the students in a school system. And it is not right. 
What we have said is we are going to correct this. We said it in the unfunded mandate language that we passed. More recently we made a commitment, as a Republican Senate anyway, to try to redress this. As we closed out the last budget year, we passed the omnibus appropriations bill. In that appropriations bill, at my suggestion, but with Senator Lott's leadership, we put in $780 million more into special education over what had originally been planned. It does not get us up to 40 percent. Maybe it got us up to 7 percent from 6 percent or 8 percent from 6 percent, but it was a downpayment. For example, in New Hampshire an extra $3.5 million coming to special needs kids toward the Federal obligation. So we showed we were serious, as a Republican Congress. 
Then to confirm and dot the `i' and cross the `t' and put the exclamation point in, we have introduced Senate bill 1. Senate bill 1 says that we, as a Republican Senate, commit ourselves to getting to full funding of the special education accounts in a 7-year period on a ramped-up basis, which means that this year we need to add additional moneys in the special education accounts. 
Why does this all relate to the President's speech? It relates to the President's speech for this one very obvious reason. The President has proposed $43 billion in new spending on education. We have not yet seen his budget to know where he is going to get this money. We do not know what accounts he is going to take the $43 billion from. We have heard him say he is going to do this in the context of reaching a balanced budget by the year 2002, which is our goal and our purpose. 
Taking that at face value, that he is going to have legitimate accounting mechanisms and have made hard decisions for the purposes of generating these dollars, it means that a large amount of new dollars is being reallocated from some other accounts into the education accounts.

Mr. GREGG. That means the President is saying, let us spend another $43 billion in education, new dollars on new programs. Well, how can he say that when we are not paying what we have already got on the books? That is the point. 
How can we go out and put on the books new programs for building construction, which clearly is not a Federal role to begin with, new programs for a variety of different initiatives 
in education which may be only marginally in the role of the Federal Government, brand new programs, when we are not paying the cost of special education, when we are pitting the special-education students and their parents against the average students and parents in a school system, when we have created this horrendous situation in the local communities where the local school dollars are being drained off to pay for a Federal obligation because the Federal Government is not willing to step up to the bar and make its payment? 
It is wrong. What we have done is wrong. Yet now we have the President suggesting a whole new group of expenditures in education. 
I suggest, before we step down this road of new education initiatives, before we start building schools for school districts--something that is clearly not a Federal role--that we pay for what is a Federal role, and that we relieve this problem, and that we take out from over the head of the special-needs students the cloud that the Federal Government has failed to pay its fair share. 
So I am just putting the Senate on record that I am going to work with the Senate leadership and other Senators who I know feel this way--and there are a lot of us here who feel this way because S. 1 is a consensus bill amongst Republican Senators--to make sure that, before we begin any new education initiatives, we fund the one we have on the books, we fund the special-needs program, and we fund it appropriately. 
So every amendment, every proposal that comes to this floor for a new education initiative will have with it, I assure you, an amendment which will say, special ed is our first obligation, the special-needs child is our first obligation. Let us look to that before we start a new program. Let us fulfill our obligations, before we start a new program, to the special-needs students and to the local taxpayer. 
Mr. President, thank you for your courtesy and for the extra time. I yield back my time.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this piece of legislation which I have just sent to the desk is an update of the legislation which I introduced last year to address what is obviously one of the most critical issues which we face as a Congress, and that is the question of the solvency of the Medicare trust funds and the proper way to deliver health care to our senior citizens. 
Last year the bill that I am introducing was basically used as the core concept for the structural reform which was included in the balance budget bill which was passed by this Senate and by the Congress and sent to the President, which he unfortunately decided to veto. 
The bill that I have just introduced is an attempt to once again bring forward what I consider to be a number of very constructive and important initiatives in the area of making Medicare a more effective system of health care for our senior citizens. 
We have all heard the facts, the facts being that the Medicare system is broken, that it is not only broken but that it is headed aggressively toward bankruptcy, that this year it lost $9.2 billion or spent $9.2 billion more in the part A trust fund than it had taken in, that the losses are increasing and will be more than $40 billion annually by the year 2000, and that, as I mentioned, the part A trust fund in Medicare will be broke, will be insolvent as of the year 2001, the early part of 2001, actually January. 
I think the actuaries may have fudged a little bit there so they would not have to say 2000. I think we are going to find quickly that the insolvency of the trust fund is going to occur in the year 2000, which is not very far away from us. 
What happens when the part A trust fund goes insolvent? Basically, the senior citizens do not have a health care system and do not have an insurance system. There is no provision in the law today that allows us to supply health care if there are no funds to pay for it in the part A trust fund. So the system will literally not exist, and senior citizens will be without a health insurance system. 
We should have addressed this last year, of course. And there was an attempt to address it last year. But because of the politics of the season, because we were in an election year--both for this Congress and for the Presidency--it was not addressed, even though sincere attempts were made from this side of the aisle. 
Those sincere attempts included, in significant part, the bill which I have just reintroduced. But they were confronted by an opposition which demagoged the issue and said that the proposals to try to bring about solvency in the Medicare part A trust fund were actually going to undermine that system when in fact what is undermining the system is the pending insolvency of the trust fund. 
President Clinton, this year, to his credit, has decided to step up to the issue of Medicare or at least said he is going to publicly, and suggested that he will propose $138 billion in savings in the Medicare accounts. 
Of course, last year when Republicans proposed savings in the Medicare accounts, they were accused of cutting Medicare. I will not use that term because I believe that we need to pursue an effort of constructive dialog here. But it is ironic that this year the President would be calling his proposal to save $138 billion as a constructive attempt to address Medicare when last year it was characterized as a savaging and extreme act, both by members of the President's party and by the Vice President, when we proposed savings not much higher than what are being proposed by the President today. 
Unfortunately, in proposing his $138 billion in savings, the President has used a lot of old ideas and what you might call attempts to address the Medicare system at the margin. Unfortunately, also, although not accounted for allegedly in the $138 billion of savings, he has also used a massive bookkeeping gimmick of moving home health care out of the part A trust fund allegedly into the part B trust fund, so actually it is under the taxpayers of America and into the general fund. It is an incredible act of flim-flam and one which hopefully will not be accepted by this Congress. 
Independent of that, the real problem of the $138 billion is not that it is inappropriate; it is that it does not address the underlying structural problem of Medicare. It addresses lower payments to providers, mostly. But the problem of Medicare is not the extra dollar we are paying to this provider or the extra 5 percent we are paying to that provider, it is the fact that it is presently structurally not supportable, the fact that the costs of Medicare are simply going up much faster than the cost of the Government generally and the rate of inflation. Not only generally, but also the rate of inflation in the health care industry. 
The system is designed as a 1960's automobile. It was created in the 1960's. In the 1960's it was not a Cadillac system. Everybody knows that. It was probably an Oldsmobile. But it is the exact same Oldsmobile designed in the 1960's that is now on the road in the 1990's. It has been patched and repaired and fixed up here and there, but we are still driving down the road in the 1990's in a 1960's car. It is not working. It is not working because it does not acknowledge the fact that the health care delivery system in this country has changed fundamentally since the 1960's. 
In the 1950's and 1960's most people had a doctor by name, an individual. Most people pursued what was known as fee-for-service medicine where they hired their doctor. Their doctor referred them to another doctor if they had a problem. They hired that doctor, and they went around hiring individual doctors. Today, health care is not provided that way in the private sector, or, for that matter, in the public sector, if you are a member of the Federal Government. Today, the way it is provided, usually you have a prepaid plan where you pay an amount upfront and you participate in a plan that provides you a variety of options with a variety of different physicians to go to. It may be in the form of an HMO or PPO or PSO, or it may be in the form of some hybrid, but there are usually a variety of different ways you get health care. Only rarely today in the private sector and in the Federal employee sector is that health care provided in the manner of going out and hiring an individual physician and then moving forward on a fee-for-service basis through the system. 
Yet, we still have Medicare delivering the vast amount of its care, the vast amount of its service, under the fee-for-service system, which has created an inflation factor in the Medicare system in the cost of delivery of that system which is basically making it unaffordable and leading to the bankruptcy of the part A trust fund. Because there is no competition today in the senior citizens' health dollars, because the system remains a closed system where fee-for-service really is only the viable way--there are a few HMO's, but they are very limited in their applicability--then, as a result, we have not brought the market force into the system, we have not 
brought efficiencies into the system, and we have not seen occur in Medicare what has occurred in the general health care delivery system in this country. 
Over the last 3 years, the rate of inflation of health care costs in this country, the inflationary rate of growth of health care costs in this country, were less than the general rate of inflation. The general rate of inflation was about 3 percent. The rate of growth of health care costs was below that number in the last 3 years in the private sector. Yet, in the Medicare system, the rate of growth of health care has remained about 10 percent. 
What my legislation does essentially is give seniors more options. That is why it is called choice care. It says to senior citizens, you can go out in the marketplace and participate in the system you presently have if you want to, in the fee-for-service system. There is no reason you cannot stay in the system you are presently in, or, alternatively, you can go into one of the other delivery systems--HMO, PPO, or PSO--whatever you want to pursue. It gives the senior citizen, if you want to simplify it, it gives the senior citizen the same options, essentially, that a person who works for the Federal Government has who is under the Federal employee health benefits program. I, as a Member of Congress, have an option to choose a number of different health care plans. Why should not the senior citizens have that same option? 
Basically, we asked that question, and we say they should. They should. Not only would it be more advantageous for a senior citizen to be able to go out and pick any number of health care programs, but it would be more advantageous for us, the Federal Government, and for the taxpayers to have those options, because we would bring competition into the system and hopefully, as a result, bring market forces into the system and, as a result, help to reduce the rate of growth of health care costs to something closer to what we are seeing in the private sector. 
We never expect that a program designed for seniors will have the same rate of growth of health care costs as the private sector because seniors, regrettably, have more health problems. We know we can do better than a 10-percent annual rate of growth. In fact, to make the trust fund solvent, we do not have to get to the private sector rate of growth. We do not have to get to a 3 percent or less rate of growth. We can make the trust fund solvent with rate of growth somewhere between 6 or 7 percent annually. 
We are only talking about reducing the rate of growth of the Medicare trust fund by 3 percent; we are talking about continuing to allow it to grow by 6 to 7 percent. This is a huge increase, a huge amount of new dollars flowing into the health care system every year. It is a result of the fact we are able to still balance the trust fund and make it solvent with that type of rate of growth that we create a huge marketplace incentive for people to compete for senior dollars in health care. It is that desire for competition, that use of competition which will lead us to a more competitive system, a more efficient system, and for a system which will actually deliver better health care to seniors. 
We put some protections in here, also, to make it clear that seniors are not giving up anything by participating in choice care. First off, as I mentioned, they have the right to stay with fee-for-service, their present plan, if they want to. 
Second, any plan that wants to compete for a senior citizen dollar must provide the core services which are presently provided under the Medicare system. You may say, if that is the case, why are they ever going to be able to charge less if they have to provide the same amount as the senior presently gets? It is called the marketplace. There are ways to provide the same services and pay less for them and have them cost less by having more efficiencies in the provider. The marketplace will produce that sort of efficiency and you will have less costs. 
Also, we give seniors the right to opt out if they choose another type of health care delivery service. If they are uncomfortable with it, they can disenroll from that service. 
Furthermore, and most importantly, we do not allow people who are competing for the seniors' dollars to discriminate. In other words, if you are a provider and you are going to make yourself available to supply senior citizens with health care, you have to take all comers. There cannot be any attempt to screen out people because they have preexisting conditions. So it will not have adverse risk selection. 
The practical implications of this are that a senior will annually receive a booklet or proposal, much like we receive as Federal employees, which will outline the various health care systems which are available to that senior. What I see happening is that there are going to be a lot of health care providers who will say, `Hey, we can provide that senior with the same health care they are getting today,' because of the 6 to 7 percent annual increase. `We can provide that senior with that same health care and throw some other benefits in, too. We can offer prescription care, we can offer eyeglasses, we can offer a variety of things that are not presently available under Medicare because we know that we can more efficiently deliver the service than the senior is presently getting on fee-for-service.' 
What I expect will happen and what I am pretty confident will happen and what people who have looked at this in depth say will happen is that the marketplace will bring forward a variety of different options from which seniors will have a choice. At the same time, we will give seniors an incentive to go out and look at those choices because what we will say to seniors is, `Listen, today, we pay about $4,800 a year for your health care per senior. You, senior citizen, to the extent you choose a health care delivery service,' which, again, has to have the core delivery services that you presently get so they cannot reduce their price because they are not delivering you what you need,' to the extent you choose a delivery service which costs less than $4,800, we will let you, the senior, keep 75 percent of the savings.' 
So if the annual premium of an HMO supplying seniors with the same service is say $4,500 and the senior chooses to go with that HMO because the senior maybe has a family member--a son or daughter who is working and a member of that HMO--and the son or daughter say, `They can give us pretty good service,' that senior will get to keep the difference between $4,800 and $4,500, or $300. That senior will get to keep 25 percent of that difference, and 75 percent will be returned to the trust fund. 
So what we have created here is a market event where a senior citizen can get a savings by shopping thoughtfully and efficiently for their health care, and where the health care providers have an incentive to come in and compete for that health care dollar. What does that cause? That causes efficiency. It causes the marketplace to create efficiency. We have learned that the Federal Government can't produce efficiency. We have learned that by having a nationalized system, which is what Medicare is, you do not have an efficient system; that you have an inefficient system. What we know from experience is the way you create efficiency and lower costs is by having competition and having a playing field where the consumer is protected, which is exactly what this does. 
So this proposal would give the seniors an incentive to be thoughtful purchasers, and would give the marketplace an incentive to come in and be thoughtful competitors, or strong competitors for the senior citizen dollars. 
Another issue that is raised and is legitimate is the question of reimbursement and how we are going to reimburse these provider groups. The President has proposed that we cut the rate of reimbursement for HMO's from 95 to 90 percent 
arbitrarily across the board. I am not going to criticize the President for trying to address the cost of growth. I think that is important. But there is a better way to do this. The fact is that the reimbursement system as it is presently structured is out of kilter. For health care services which are identical--and in some cases they are better in the lower-cost States than the higher-cost States--the reimbursements are not identical. They are totally out of whack. 
For example, there is a beneficiary reimbursement in South Dakota of about $200 per person. But on Staten Island it cost about $767 per person. Studies by Dr. Weinberg at Dartmouth, and a number of other professionals, have concluded that the service isn't any better but that it is simply an issue of regional disparity. And in fact in New Hampshire, which happens to be one of the lowest-cost health care States in the country--a little more than South Dakota but not much more--we are rated the No. 1 State in the country for health care delivery systems. Yet, our delivery systems are done at a cost which is one-third the price of what it cost on Staten Island. 
So this regional disparity has basically penalized States and areas that are trying to be efficient and effective in delivering their health care. 
Take Hawaii, for example. Hawaii has one of the highest costs of living in the country because of the fact that it is an island, and everything has to be shipped in, I guess. But at the same time Hawaiian medical care is one of the most efficient cost delivery systems in the country. So they are penalized. Those health care systems are penalized by a lower reimbursement rate. 
What we suggest--and this is a complicated issue--we are suggesting that as we go forward with this Choice Care proposal that we begin to level out the playing field on reimbursement so that we no longer are rewarding the inefficient, and so that the efficient receive the proper payment. We do this by not cutting anybody because we are increasing funding for Medicare throughout this period by 6 to 7 percent. We do not have to cut anything. What we are going to do is slow the rate of increase to those areas that have a much higher reimbursement and accelerate the rate of increase to those with lower reimbursement areas. 
As a result, we will at some point--there is a timeframe in our bill that allows for this--about 5 to 7 years from now get to a period where we have everybody in a much narrower band of reimbursement which leads to a much more efficient market. 
So the underlying theme here is simple. Under the Choice Care plan, which as I mentioned was adopted in significant proportions, or the concepts were adopted in significant proportions in the last budget, seniors should be given essentially the same choices that members of the Federal Government have and that the average working American has--the ability to go out in the marketplace and choose from a variety of different health care providers. And in making that choice they should be given an incentive to be efficient. 
So we are going to reward them by giving them a return on the amount that they save, and at the same time we are going to say to the marketplace we are no longer going to disproportionately reward inefficient areas at the expense of efficient areas, and at the same time we are going to say to the seniors, `You have a variety of options to choose from. But, if you want to stay where you are, and you are happy where you are, 
you can do that.' 
So how does this help the Federal Government in the end? How does this get Medicare costs under control? It basically amounts to a major structural reform of the system. It is not playing at the edges the way the President proposes. It is a major structural reform. In the end we will have brought the marketplace into the system, we will have created an atmosphere where seniors will be looking at a variety of choices for health care, and where efficiency will be something that will have to be undertaken by the provider groups. They are going to be able to get the seniors' participation, and those seniors today who are in their fee-for-service probably are not going to opt into this overly aggressively because they were raised in the 1950's and 1960's with fee-for-service. We understand that. But what we also understand is that the coming generation of seniors has been in a workplace environment where the variety of health care service delivery system has been available to them. They are comfortable with a variety of health care delivery systems. And as such they are not going to shy away from taking advantage of the marketplace. 
So, as we go down the road we will get the type of savings we need. We will see that rate of growth reduced from 10 percent back to 6 or 7 percent. That is still a substantial rate of growth. Then we will have put in place something that can give us a long-term lasting hope for restructure of reform, or reform in the Medicare trust fund in order to avoid the bankruptcy. If we do not do this, the trust fund part A goes bankrupt. It is that simple. That is not acceptable. 
If we do not undertake structural reform, if we simply undertake the reform at the margins, like the President has proposed, we put off that bankruptcy maybe for 2, 3, or 4 years. But it still occurs. Our obligation as policymakers is to make the more fundamental broader changes that are needed for a long-term solution to this problem. And this is one major step in that direction. 
Mr. President, I appreciate your time and yield the floor.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I introduce a bill that will have a significant impact on the promotion of long-term investment through a reduction in the capital gains tax. I believe the Congress has a responsibility to enact laws promoting long-term capital investment and savings by all Americans. Part of fulfilling this obligation must include implementing a plan that would reduce the current capital gains tax rate on long-term investments. 
We must also, however, balance this important economic goal against the moral issue of adding increasing debt onto our children's shoulders. This becomes an unavoidable issue in the capital gains debate because the Joint Committee on Taxation scores capital gains a big revenue loser. This scoring issue is an unfortunate fact that we in Congress cannot ignore. 
Accordingly, I have developed legislation that would encourage long-term investment by amending the current capital gains tax using a sliding scale plan. My bill encourages an individual to hold an asset over a number of years, thus, allowing a greater tax reduction on investments, with the maximum benefit being reached after 4 years. It would reward individuals who look toward contributing to a savings plan over a number of years, while at the same time making quick-fix investments less attractive. This sliding scale plan would encourage investments that benefit long-term savings, such as a child's education, an individual's retirement, or other non-speculative holdings. 
The theory behind the sliding scale reduction on capital gains hinges upon an agreed goal: the promotion of savings and long-term investment through a capital gains cut, while recognizing our current fiscal realities. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this plan would lose just $7.4 billion in revenue over the 1995-2000 period.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Berlin, NH, and to introduce legislation that will assist Berlin in preserving this history. 
While the city of Berlin is 100 years old this year, its history goes back further. The first settlers came to Berlin for no apparent reason. They were farmers and the land there did not promise to be any more fruitful than the land they left just down the Androscoggin River; but, they were restless and independent so they came across the mountains to start a new community in this isolated area. 
The Plantation of Maynesborough, as Berlin was called, was named after the most illustrious of the English gentlemen to whom it was granted by the Crown in 1771. Although the land was rugged and it was a hard place to live, food was plentiful. The woods consisting of seemingly endless stands of timber were filled with deer and game; the brooks and river were loaded with trout. 
Those first farmers who made the move from down the river found good farmland upstream from the falls. In 1824, William Sessions cleared 5 acres of land on the east side of the river and came back in 1825 with his nephew to plant crops and build a log house. William Sessions did not stay around long enough to see Maynesborough become officially incorporated as the city of Berlin 1897, but his nephew Cyrus Wheeler did. 
Nearly half a century before, however, the character of Berlin began its change from farms to industry. In 1851, J.B. Brown and three other businessmen from Portland, ME, formed a partnership under the name of H. Winslow & Co. and purchased the land on top of the falls. They started a successful lumber business in the thick forest and used the natural water power of the river to power their mill. The J.B. Brown Co., saw the railroad coming to Berlin, thus, opening a direct line of transportation to Portland and market centers for the first time. 
In the 1920's, Berlin, NH, was the capital of the papermaking world and was becoming known as the city that trees built. The Brown family's Berlin Mills Co., controlled 3 million acres in New England and Quebec and was world renowned for cutting-edge forestry, research, and papermaking. The mills along the Androscoggin River made not only pulp and an array of paper products but also lumber, wood flour, conduit pipes, and furniture. Brown's staff of 4,000 to 5,000 swelled Berlin to a population of 20,000. 
The growth of Berlin reflects the diversity of people who came to stay: French Canadians, Yankees from northern New England farms, Norwegians, Italians, Irish, and Russians. They sought a chance to make a better living and found it in the mills, blacksmith shops, machine shops, farms, stores, railroad yards, and in the winter logging camps. Berlin deserves recognition for many other reasons as well. For example tupperware and the Feron Rap and Rule, the first retractable ruler, were invented in Berlin. But one aspect of the city calls for special attention: Its heritage as a leader in introducing skiing to America. 
Scandinavian immigrants were highly sought after by mill recruiters not only for their expertise in logging, but also because they were acquainted with long, severe winters similar to those of the North Country. They chose to develop their individual neighborhoods in clusters as did most of the immigrants. As a whole, the entire Scandinavian neighborhood was commonly known as Norwegian Village. Because of their love for winter, they, more than any other groups, forged the way for winter sports in Berlin. Both cross-country ski racing and competition ski jumping were introduced to the region by the Scandinavian community. These events were featured at many of the winter carnivals that Berlin hosted. 
Other than its socioeconomic forest-based heritage, Berlin is probably best known for its major contribution to the development of skiing in the country. The use of skis by newly arriving Scandinavians was at first utilitarian, winter travel around the community. In time, cross-country ski racing became popular and Berlin became known as the Cradle of Nordic Skiing in America. The Nansen Ski Club, which is named in honor of arctic explorer Fridtjof Nansen, was founded in 1872 as the Skii Klubbin. Today, it remains the oldest continuously organized ski club in the United States. Starting in the 1890's, skiers used a small hill in Norwegian Village to practice and perform their jumps. 
Then, in 1936, a new jump was constructed here at this site thanks to a cooperative effort between the city of Berlin and the Nansen Ski Club. This 80-meter jump has a 171.5-foot tower, a 225-foot vertical drop, and a descent angle of approximately 37.5 degrees. For almost 50 years, this was the largest ski jump in the Eastern United States and the foremost jump in the country. Also, this was the site of all major championship ski jumping competitions, as well as many Olympic tryouts. Several famous ski jumpers were competitors here including a host of Berlinites who went on to compete in the Olympics. 
Mr. President, I have only touched on a few of the historical aspects that make Berlin, NH, unique. The legislation that I am introducing, the Androscoggin River Valley Heritage Area Act, will establish a locally oriented commission to assist the city of Berlin in identifying and studying its region's historical and cultural assets of the past 100 years.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak a little bit about the balanced budget amendment which is being brought forward on this floor in the near future. It is obviously one of the most significant items that this Congress will deal with. As we all know, in the last Congress it passed the House and unfortunately failed here in the Senate by one vote. 
So it is a matter of substantive policy which we must attend to, and which we as a Congress should pass. There are a lot of reasons for passing the balanced budget amendment. The most important, in my opinion, is that we put in place procedures in this Nation which will not allow one generation to take from another generation its opportunity for hope and for economic prosperity. Unfortunately, every time we go to the well and borrow money here, as a Congress, we are requiring our children to pay that debt. It truly is unfair for one generation, which has benefited so much from the greatness and energy and prosperity of our Nation, to be taking from another generation its ability to also benefit from that greatness, energy, and prosperity. But that is what we do, we run up the debt of the United States and pass it on to the next generation. 
In dealing with the balanced budget, there has been a lot of discussion as to how it should be structured, how this constitutional amendment for a balanced budget should be structured. One of the primary arguments that has been made, on the other side of the aisle especially, is that any balanced budget amendment must not include in its calculation the receipts that flow into the Social Security trust fund for the purposes of determining whether or not the Government is in balance. This is what is known as the Social Security argument. 
I think it is put forward for a variety of reasons, some of them substantive and, regrettably, some of them political. We all know whenever you raise the issue of Social Security you not only gather the attention of a number of Americans but, in many instances, if you raise it in certain ways you scare a lot of Americans because many Americans' lifestyles, their ability to exist financially and their capacity to make it from day to day, depend on their capacity to receive Social Security and the support of Social Security. It has been an extraordinarily successful program. 
But, in the context of the balanced budget amendment, the way it is being presented is, I think, a bit of an obfuscation of what is actually the situation. Because what is being represented, if you want to get down to the simplest statement of it, what is being represented is that today the Social Security funds are essentially being raided to operate the Federal Government. That is the basic argument that is being made on the other side. And the argument therefore follows that we should not do that, we should only use revenues that are available for the purposes of operating the Government in order to operate the Government. 
In other words, if we raise $1 of taxes to pay for defense or to pay for education or to pay for any variety of things that we do at the Federal level, that is where that dollar should go. But if we raise $1 for purposes of the Social Security trust fund through the withholding tax, if we raise that dollar, it should only be spent on Social Security. And to set up a balanced budget amendment which may in some way use those dollars to operate the general Government is unfair and inappropriate to seniors who deserve that money to support them. 
This argument makes sense just stated in that way. But it does not make any sense if you look at the substance of the way Social Security works. Today, in fact, it raises some very serious concerns about what the promoters of this argument really want to do with the Social Security trust fund. Because today the way the Social Security trust fund works is this. You pay $1 into the Social Security trust fund. That $1, as a working American--whether working on an assembly line in Detroit or whether you are working as a computer programmer in New Hampshire --you pay $1 into the Social Security trust fund and that dollar is immediately paid out to support somebody who is on Social Security today. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system. Today, under the system as it is structured, more people are paying into the fund than are taking out of the fund in total dollars. If you discount interest payments as a technical thing, basically you are paying $29 billion more into the Social Security fund than is taken out of the Social Security fund, for the purposes of paying seniors their support under Social Security. 
So the senior citizen might say, or some from the other side of the aisle seem to be saying, `Well, that $29 billion should be available to Social Security and only Social Security. Because, after all, it was raised with Social Security taxes.' I am willing to accept that as an argument; as an argument. But how does it actually work? How does it actually work? 
Under the law, what do the Social Security trustees do with this extra $29 billion they will receive this year that they are not going to pay out in benefits? Do they invest it in the private sector or put it in a savings account designated to a senior's name? Do they in some other way hold that asset for the benefit of that senior citizen, for the benefit of a senior citizen or for the benefit of the wage earner who paid into the trust fund? No, they do not. They do not. Why don't they? Because, under the law, the Social Security trustees can only do one thing with that surplus, with that extra $29 billion they are taking in this year they are not spending for benefits. They can only lend that money to the Federal Government. They cannot lend it to anybody else. They can only lend it to the Federal Government under a special loan document that yields a special interest payment. 
So the money goes back to the Federal Government and is spent by the Federal Government as a loan. That means the $29 billion is not in some special savings account for a senior citizen or for the wage earner who paid it in. It is not in some special stock agreement, stock certificate. It is not invested in IBM or General Motors, or not invested in a mutual fund like the Fidelity fund. It can only be invested in the Federal Government. 
Of course, what is the Federal Government going to do with that $29 billion? Is it going to sit on it? Hold it under a mattress? Of course not. What the Federal Government does with that $29 billion is it operates the Government of the United States. If the $29 billion that is being lent to the Federal Government by the Social Security system were not available to the Federal Government, the Federal Government would have to go out, theoretically, and borrow it from somebody else, borrow it in the marketplace by issuing Treasury notes. So, what you have here, essentially, is a pay-as-you-go system. Everything that is paid in is paid out. But to the extent it is not paid out, to the extent there is a surplus, the money has to go to the Federal Government. 
What the other side is saying is the Federal Government should not be allowed to use that money for the purposes of accounting for its budget, as to whether or not it is balanced. As a practical effect, what does that mean? What does it really mean, what they are saying? It means one of two things. It means either: First, they want all that surplus invested in something other than Federal-issued debt, they must want it invested in the stock market or maybe they want to invest it in real estate, or maybe they want to invest it in futures funds or maybe they want to buy into the Albanian Ponzi scheme. But they do not want it invested in the Federal Government. That is the first thing it means. That is the first alternative. 
I have to say that is a very dangerous idea. Many people have considered that idea and it has been of significant concern. But to just arbitrarily say the Federal Government will not be able to borrow money from the Social Security fund and therefore somebody else is going to have to borrow the money, they are going to have to lend it to somebody else, is to say you are going to privatize--that is what they are suggesting--they are going to suggest privatizing the surplus of the Social Security fund. Not designated to any individual contributor or taxpayer, which I happen to think makes sense, but, rather, just simply you cannot invest Social Security funds in the Federal Government any longer, you have to invest in some other vehicle. That is, in practice, what they are proposing. They are not saying that because they are using the political cover of this hocus pocus about Social Security. 
But in practice, that's exactly what they are presenting as their concept. OK. 
If that isn't the alternative, if the alternative is you should have to invest in something other than the Government with the Social Security surplus, then the other alternative is--what they are saying--we're looking at a bookkeeping event, because if the Federal Government is allowed to borrow the money from the Social Security trust fund, if the Federal Government is allowed to borrow the surplus from the Social Security trust fund, then what is the difference from today? There isn't any difference. 
Today, the Federal Government, for the purposes of operation, borrows the money from the Social Security trust fund, gives the Social Security trust fund a debt instrument and pays interest on it. What they are suggesting is either, one, that shouldn't occur under their proposal, which means they are calling for the privatization of the surplus, or, two, if it should occur, then there's no difference from today, they're just talking about a bookkeeping event. Instead of the Federal Government accounting for it one way, the Federal Government will account for its borrowing another way. But the fact of the matter is, the Federal Government is still borrowing the money, and there will be absolutely no difference. 
So this argument from the other side is highly specious. It cannot be defended on the basis of substance. It can be defended on the basis of politics, I admit to that. This is great politics: Let's trot out the old Social Security again. Let's scare the seniors. But on the basis of substance, it has no legs. All you have to do is look at the fact of the matter and recognize it has no legs, because I don't think these folks over there on the other side of the aisle who are suggesting this are suggesting we privatize the surplus, that we allow the surplus to be willy-nilly invested in the market. 
I happen to think there are some strong arguments--this is another whole issue--if we are taking that surplus and rather than taxing it, rather than raising it through taxes, allowing the wage earner to retain that surplus, give them a tax cut, basically, on their payroll tax and let them put that surplus, that percentage of their payroll tax that represents that surplus, which is about 1 percent, in their own savings account so they can save for themselves for retirement. But that is not the issue here. 
The issue here is whether the other side really believes they want to privatize the surplus, and if it is not their position they want to privatize the surplus, essentially what they are saying is they want a bookkeeping event to occur, because they are still going to let the Federal Government borrow the money under one scenario, under a balanced budget, and they borrow it under one set of books. Without the balanced budget, they would balance it under another set of books. But as a practical matter, the effect would be the same. The budget would be balanced. 
Is my time expired? I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what we have here is a great political game. There are a lot of people who don't want a constitutional amendment to balance the budget because they don't want the Federal Government to be put under the restraint of fiscal responsibility, and they ought to step forward and say that. They should not be hiding behind the Social Security argument, because it is fallacious, as I have just mentioned. 
Or--here is another point--if they are going to make this point with the Social Security trust fund, that it should be outside the unified budget, that it should not be part of the budgeting process and the surplus should not be accounted for under the process, but that we create a new accounting method, which has the same effect as a practical matter, then why aren't they making the same point with the Medicare trust fund? 
Why? Well, I will tell you why. Because if they were to make that point with the Medicare trust fund, you would see that their argument would require them to fill a huge Medicare hole. Medicare is going broke. The trust fund is going broke. It does not have a surplus. 
Here is a chart that has just been put up. This chart reflects how much the Medicare trust fund is going broke. This is a bar chart, and we can see the Medicare trust fund began last year, I guess, actually, in the deficit. Then next year, it is a $48 billion deficit; in 2005, it is a $91 billion deficit, and it is a geometric progression from there, reflecting the tremendous imbalance in the Medicare trust fund, which we all know exists which, unfortunately, was denied during the election and any proposals to address it. I happen to have a couple that are fairly substantive which have been met with a bit of demagoguery. 
The fact is, this exists, and the question becomes, why wouldn't the practical arguments that are being made on Social Security for taking it off budget be made on the trust fund for Medicare to take it off budget? 
The obvious reasons are that the folks on the other side who are making this argument are not making this argument for substantive purposes, they are making it for political purposes. The politics of the situation require that they not talk about the Medicare trust fund problem, but rather that they talk about a nonexistent Social Security issue, as of today--a major Social Security issue down the road, but as of today, a nonexistent Social Security problem. 
But if they were to raise the Medicare issue, then they would have to ask about how they are going to address the fund question, because if you use their logic for the Medicare trust fund, they would have to come up with a proposal this year, if the balanced budget amendment were passed with the Social Security language that has been proposed, but if that Social Security language was also applied to Medicare--Medicare being a trust fund as important to seniors as Social Security, I would argue, and, in many instances, even more important because it is a health care insurance--well, then this year they would have to come up with a proposal to bring into balance the Medicare trust fund to the tune of $48 billion--$48 billion. And that would create some significant policy questions. 
That is exactly what we should do, of course, and exactly what I hope we will do. But the fact is, the reason it is not being discussed in this debate is because it means you have to face up to the hard policy decisions that are involved in balancing the Medicare trust fund. 
So if you are going to separate the Social Security trust fund, why not separate the Medicare trust fund? The fact that they are not separated, I think, shows the political nature of this Social Security argument. 
So that is just a quick recitation or response, if you will, to those folks who got on the floor today giving us the Social Security sales pitch. 
The fact is that the initial proposal to take Social Security out of the balanced budget amendment proposal means one of two things: One, they either want to privatize the surplus and have it invested in places other than the Federal Government or, two, they are just going through a bookkeeping game, because the Federal Government will continue to borrow the money. 
The fact that they haven't included the Medicare trust fund only reinforces the superficiality of their position and the fact that their position is political and not substantive. 
There is going to be a lot more discussion about the balanced budget amendment before we get to the end of this road, before we get to a vote. We are going to hear a lot about Social Security. But I do hope that people will look beyond the language of the debate and actually look at the substance, because on the substance, the Social Security argument, as presented--the Social Security position, as presented--does not have any legs. You could present it so it did have legs, but, in this instance, that is not the case. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation which I now send to the desk. 
Mr. President, I am sure that my colleagues are familiar with the report recently released by the Social Security Advisory Council. That group, appointed by HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, was charged with making recommendations as to how to place our largest and most popular program--Social Security--on a stable and secure path for the 21st century. Their recommendations have accelerated an already vigorous debate concerning the eventual course of Social Security reform. 
As someone who is greatly concerned about the future of Social Security, let me offer my view that we cannot afford the kind of gridlock and partisanship in rescuing that program that we have seen in the Medicare debate. It is vitally important that all of us come together to address problems of retirement security in a bipartisan way--one that involves all of the important players in this debate--both in Congress and within the administration. 
My legislation, Mr. President, would simply establish an additional safeguard for the solvency of the Social Security system on which so many American senior citizens depend. Specifically, it will require the Commissioner of Social Security--at the same time each year that the Social Security trustees report to Congress on the solvency of the Social Security system--to recommend those legislative actions which the Commissioner deems necessary to place the Social Security system in long-term actuarial balance. 
Mr. President, I believe that there is broad bipartisan consensus about certain aspects of Social Security. Certainly there is wide bipartisan support for the view that protecting the stability and solvency of the system should be among our highest national priorities. And, most of us recognize the stark fiscal realities facing the Social Security system. I refer to the fact that according to the Social Security trustees, beginning in the year 2012, the Social Security system will face annual operating deficits, meaning that there will then be inadequate revenues coming into the system to support current benefits. From that year onward--indeed for most of the 75-year period during which actuarial solvency is measured--there is an ever widening gap between the promises of Social Security and the means available to pay for them, unless we act to change the law. 
It is beyond those points of agreement, however, that our bipartisan consensus breaks down. Even though we all know that it will take bipartisan action to safeguard this system, the Social Security system could well become a sharpening focus of partisan political activity. Apparently the temptations here are simply too great for politicians to resist. It is the easier--though less responsible--course to ignore the problems within the system, and to take political advantage of those who seek to repair them. 
We thus find ourselves in a peculiar situation. Each year, the Social Security trustees send information to Congress about Social Security's troubled future, and call upon Congress to act to restore the system to long-term solvency. Yet, at the same time, the custodians of that system--indeed, the soon-departing Social Security Commissioner herself--remain utterly silent as to how this is to be done. It is astounding to me that an individual will again be placed in charge of this most enormous and vital Government program, and yet not be required under the law to forward proposals to keep it stable and secure. 
Toward the end of last year, the staff of the Budget Committee were briefed by representatives of the Social Security Administration as to how they were meeting their established performance goals under the Government Performance and Results Act. One of the goals established by the Social Security Administration was to improve public confidence in Social Security. Meanwhile, no recommendations are coming from the Commissioner of Social Security as to how to justify that confidence in the long term. It is long past time to repair this discontinuity. 
I believe that this legislation should not be controversial. It stands to elementary reason that it should be part and parcel of the duties inherent in the position of Social Security Commissioner, to make such recommendations as are necessary to protect the future of the Social Security system. I hope that Congress will act quickly, and will pass this legislation early in this session.

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise to speak, along with my colleagues, on the good counsel, good decision the President has made in choosing Madeleine Albright. I think it also is appropriate at this time to acknowledge the extraordinary effort and the extraordinary commitment of service that was made by Secretary Christopher during his term as Secretary of State. He was a patient and tireless pursuer of peace around the world. I may not have agreed with all his policies, but certainly in a number of areas his successes are considerable and I point specifically to the Mideast. 
Equally important, he was an individual totally committed to raising up the standard of living and of support for members of his team, his Foreign Service team and their families, something I am also committed to, that, as chairman of the appropriations committee which has jurisdiction over the State Department, I feel very strongly we must continue to pursue. So I congratulate him on his efforts. 
Ambassador Albright is someone I have had a chance to work with, relative to her time at the United Nations. I know she will bring to the office of Secretary of State a great deal of integrity and a great deal of energy. Of course she has a unique personal background that I think will be a tremendous asset to the President, as he and she develop international policy. 
But, as we address the issue of Madeleine Albright's nomination I think we need to go beyond the person. I intend to vote for her and vote with enthusiasm for her, but I do believe very strongly that we need to raise the issue of policy, as to how this administration is pursuing the decisions of foreign policy in a number of arenas because there are some problems and I have significant reservations, as I know many of my colleagues do. I know there has been some discussion on the issue of Bosnia, and the question as to how the administration acted and is going to continue to act there, the fact that basically neither the Congress nor the American people were told fully of the policies there, and in fact were really misled as to the decisions that were made there, as to the removal of American troops. But rather than focusing on that issue, that I know some of my colleagues were talking about, I want to focus on two other issues I think are critical and about which this administration's policies need to be reviewed with considerable intensity. 
The first issue is how we deal with the United Nations. It is my understanding the administration will be sending up a supplemental request or some other form of request for an appropriation to fully fund the arrearages that are due to the United Nations. I happen to be a supporter of the United Nations, its goals and purposes. But I also am realistic enough to know that body has not functioned very effectively and that body has spent a lot of money ineffectively and has had a significant track record of patronage, of misuse of funds, and in some instances of actual abusive use of funds. 
The question becomes how should we pay these arrearages? Should we just do it in a carte blanche manner or just do it in an orderly manner that allows the United States to assert financial interests of the integrity within the institution, of its management of day-to-day operation, and of its delivery of services? To date we have not had a great deal of success in that area. There has been a lot of talk about it. The United Nations has claimed that it is now funding a no-growth budget, something which is very suspect even though the State Department has certified it. It is very suspect because there are $154 million worth of reductions in spending which they claim they are going to make, but which have not been identified. Yet we see the State Department accepting them at face value, which is something I think this Congress should have a great deal of problems doing for any American agency. 
In addition, we hear the United Nations is aggressively pursuing reform within itself. But that reform does not seem to be broad. It also does not seem to be willing to be subject to significant review. An inspector general has been appointed, but that inspector general's portfolio has been significantly limited. 
We, as a Congress, have also been significantly circumscribed in our ability to determine how the dollars are being spent. 
Why is it important that we look at this? Well, because 25 cents of every dollar that the United Nations spends comes from the American taxpayer, and we have to go back to our constituents and say those dollars are being spent effectively. 
I personally have no problem funding the United Nations at a level that is reasonable, but I do have a great deal of problem funding some group of individuals simply sitting at a desk who got those jobs out of patronage or because they happened to know somebody or related to somebody and are not pursuing and accomplishing a great deal, either to the benefit of the United Nations or the world. Yet, there appears to be a significant amount of that going on. 
I had one U.N. spokesperson say to me, `But we have 290 countries looking over our shoulders making sure every cent is spent appropriately.' The fact is, just a few nations are actually paying for the spending. Most of the nations that participate in the United Nations either contribute very little or, in some cases, nothing to general coffers, and they are not looking over their shoulders to determine how the money is being spent effectively. In many instances, they are looking over the shoulders to see how much money they can get spent on them. 
So, really, it is the United States role in the exercise of reviewing the United Nations that we be much more aggressive in financial review and management of that institution. 
This is something I do not think this administration has pursued aggressively enough. Ambassador Albright, to her credit, tried to pursue it aggressively, but I think that once we take off the lever of the arrearages issue and simply sign a blank check for arrearages, we lose our capacity to effectively pursue United Nations reform in its own house, and that is something that I will be very resistant to doing. 
I believe Congress should put a strong fence around any funds for the United Nations, and before those moneys can be spent for arrearages, there must be a hard account--a hard account--of how the reforms have occurred and whether or not they are going to be effective. 
Second, this administration's actions in the area of terrorism, which is a core issue of foreign policy--in fact, there is no greater threat to this country today than the act of a terrorist, either orchestrated by a foreign power or orchestrated by an international group of individuals directed at our country--there is no greater threat to our country today. 
We came out of the cold war where the threat was two nations confronting each other with nuclear armament into a world where we have innumerable factions around the world who, for whatever reasons--whether they are religious, whether they are personal, whether they are just economic--have decided to make the United States the target of their concerns and, in many instances, these are fanatics. 
We, as a nation, must be much more aggressive in addressing the issue of terrorism. To do this, we have to have a coordinated effort that starts with the President and involves the core agencies at the Federal level, including the State Department, the CIA, the Defense Department and the Justice Department, and especially the FBI in the Justice Department. 
I have been concerned and have spoken on this floor a number of instances about the fact that although we have leadership in those Departments who have raised the issue of terrorism to a high standard within their Departments, and although those leaders talk to each other--Secretary Christopher was aggressive in talking to other agency heads, the Defense Department, CIA, and Justice--we do not yet have in place a systematic process for pushing down through the agencies the cooperation which is necessary in order to have a coordinated effort. In fact, we still have in the field significant resistance from the State Department to FBI agents being placed overseas for the basic purpose of law enforcement, and we have a real lack of communication, in many instances, between the FBI, CIA, and the field people who do the work for the State Department. 
Until we put in place a systematic process of developing information and getting it back to a central group in this country who can use that information effectively, we will be continuing to blind ourselves as a nation as to the threat of terrorism and our ability to respond to it. 
This has to come from the top. It has to come from the President. The President has to have the leadership of the agencies sit with him on a regular basis and develop a plan which is then communicated down through the various levels of the different Departments. But it has not occurred yet. To be honest, I do not think there is a sense of urgency expressed yet within this administration to do that. So, once again, I have a strong concern and hope that they will take this issue on. 
So those are two public policy issues which I think this administration has yet to adequately address, and I hope the new 
Secretary of State, Ambassador Albright, will pursue them. They are put on the table by myself as a matter of a caveat item of concern that, as chairman of the committee which has jurisdiction over the State Department and the Justice Department, I intend to continue to push and to which I hope this administration will respond. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

Of the 10 items listed by the majority leader today as being the priority items which the Senate shall pursue under the Republican agenda, No. 1 was the balanced budget amendment.

Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I want to speak briefly here to the second item on the agenda, which is education. Obviously, we all recognize the significance and importance of education. We also recognize, those of us who have been involved in the issue for a while, that the issue of education is, for the most part, settled at the local school level, at the local community level, especially as it involves elementary and secondary education, and that the Federal role is narrow and one which is focused on specific areas. It is not the Federal Government's obligation nor is it appropriate that the Federal Government step into the designing or the curriculum or the choosing of the proper activities for school systems. 
Rather, it is the Federal Government's role to pick areas where it can assist the local school districts and can assist parents in helping their children to get a better education. The proposal that has been put forward by the Republican Senate today, Republican Members of the Senate, as the second item on our list of 10, is a very strong proposal on behalf of the parents of America and the students of America. 
It is an effort to identify a number of areas where we think the Federal Government can assist parents in helping their children get a better education. We all recognize that education is the core activity that we must undertake if we are to have a competitive society. 
We especially recognize this in New England where we depend so much on brainpower because we have no great natural resources. Our natural resource is the intelligence of our citizenry, which is extraordinarily high and depends on a strong education system. 
In this area I want to highlight two activities that have been pointed to by our proposal. The first is that we understand that there is this huge baby-boom generation--of which Bill Clinton happens to be the most visible individual--which happens to also have children. And all those children of that baby-boom generation, people like Chelsea, people like my own children, are moving into the college-age years. 
There are a lot of parents who are very concerned about how they are going to pay for the high cost of higher education. This proposal gives parents an option. It gives them an opportunity, sets up the Bob Dole grants, which are the specific vehicle that allows parents to invest for their children's education, to save for their children's education, and be able to plan ahead so that they can use the vehicle of, basically, a designated savings account which will receive significant tax benefits to assist them in getting ready for their children's college education. 
In addition, it supports prepaid tuition plans that many of our States are now pursuing, where parents can actually choose a college or group of colleges within a State and pay the tuition early and thus avoid the cost of inflation and put themselves in a position where they can better afford the cost of education as their children get older and the costs go up. 
In addition, it expands the deduction for student loan interest, a very important element in having the ability to go to college or go to graduate school and to be able to get a loan and still be able to pay it back. This expansion of the deduction will have a positive impact in that area. 
It expands study awards and assists employers who are assisting their employees in higher education. It is a very 
significant effort to make higher education more affordable for the families of America. 
In addition, the bill has another major element which is absolutely critical, especially in New Hampshire. That is, it says that the Federal Government is financially going to step up to its obligation to special ed children. A long time ago we passed something called 94142, which was an excellent bill, the purpose of which was to make special education more readily available to children who needed it. 
The concept was that the Federal Government would pay 40 percent of the cost and the States would pay 60 percent of the costs. Today, unfortunately, the Federal Government is only paying about 6 percent of the costs that are borne in order to care for a child who has special requirements in education. 
As a result, this has put a huge burden on the local communities and the local school systems. States like New Hampshire, which rely heavily on real estate taxes to support their schools, or even States that rely on State government income taxes or sales taxes, find that a large percentage of the tax dollars they are raising for education are going to support what should have been the Federal obligation to help out with the special education child. 
As we all know, the special education child can, in instances, cost $100,000 or more as compared with a child going through the system in an average school system which may cost $4,000. So it can skew dramatically the ability to apply resources to benefit other children in the system because of the fact that the Federal Government has shirked its obligation to come forward with its 40 percent, as it said it would when it initially passed this bill a long time ago. 
So what we have proposed as Republicans is that the Federal Government will finally step forward and fund special education at near the 40-percent level. We are talking about a $10 billion increase in funding for special education, which increase will be met by ramping up, over a series of years, 7 years, and thus allowing the States and the communities to free up those education dollars which they are now using in order to support the Federal obligation to care for the special ed child, to educate the special ed child, to free up those dollars to use them to expand education activity for other children in the school system. 
If you want to look at it in its cleanest sense, it is actually going to be the largest block grants to local education the Federal Government has ever pursued. It should have occurred earlier, but it is going to occur now as a result of the commitment that has been made by the Republican majority here in the Senate. 
The sign that it is going to occur is the fact that we already made the downpayment. In the last session--and this did not get much attention unfortunately; it should have gotten a lot more attention; I do not know why it did not get a lot more attention; maybe it was because of a national election and people wanted jinglese on their positions-- but in the last budget process last September we, as Republican Members of the Senate, put $730 million more into special education than the present funding was. We increased it by that amount of money. 
It was a downpayment on this effort to try to fully fund the 40 percent that the Federal Government originally said it was going to fund. As a result, a State like New Hampshire will receive an increase of approximately $3 million. That is a lot of money to help out with the special education issues. 
So we are not talking in rosy scenarios here. We are not using words. We are not trying to create perceptions. We are talking in terms of deeds. We have already made the downpayment on this effort to expand our commitment to special education. And now with the putting forward of the Republican list of initiatives for this Congress, we are making it very clear that we are going to follow through on that commitment. 
This will be positive for the children across this country and for the educational systems across this country. I think Republicans can take great pride that we at least have been willing to step up to this very critical issue of first educating our children in college and relieving the pressure on parents who are trying to send their children to college; and, second, helping out with the special ed needs which the States have for so long borne but which the Federal Government has for so long said it would bear. 
Madam President, I yield back my time.  
Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.
