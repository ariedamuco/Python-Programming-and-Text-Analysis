Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation introduced by the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. I would have preferred the approach taken in my own home health bill, which I introduced last April and which has 29 Senate cosponsors, because it would have done more to level the playing field and provide more relief to historically cost-effective agencies. However, I understand that the chairman faced a difficult task of balancing a number of competing issues, and the bill we are considering today is an important first step that will move the process forward and provide a measure of relief to those cost-effective agencies in every State that are currently being penalized by the formula used to calculate the per-beneficiary limit. 
America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have enabled a growing number of our most frail and vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they want to be--in their own homes. However, critics have long pointed out that Medicare's historic cost-based payment for home health care has inherent incentives for home care agencies to provide more services, which has driven up costs. 
Therefore, there was widespread support for the Balanced Budget Act provision calling for the implementation of a prospective payment system for home care. Until then, home health agencies are being paid according to a new `interim payment system,' which unfortunately is critically flawed. 
As we are all aware, the Health Care Financing Administration has diverted considerable resources to solving its Y2K problem so that there will be no slowdown of Medicare payments in 2000. As a result, implementation of the prospective payment system for home health agencies will be delayed, and home health agencies will remain on IPS far longer than Congress envisioned when it enacted the Balanced Budget Act. This makes it all the more imperative that we act now to address the problems with a system that effectively rewards the agencies the have provided the most visits and spent the most Medicare dollars, while it penalizes low-cost, more efficient providers. 
Home health agencies in the Northeast are among those that have been particularly hard-hit by the formula change. As the Wall Street Journal recently observed, `If New England had been just a little greedier, its home health industry would be a lot better off now . . . Ironically, . . . [the region] is getting clobbered by the system because of its tradition of nonprofit community service and efficiency. 
Moreover, there are wide disparities in payments and no logic to the variance in payment levels. The average patient cap in the East South Central region is almost $2,500 higher than New England's without any evidence that patients in the southern States are sicker or that nurses and other home health personnel in this region cost more. 
Moreover, the current per-beneficiary limits range from a low of $760 for one agency to a high of $53,000 at another. As such, the system gives a competitive advantage to high-cost agencies over their lower costs neighbors, since agencies in a particular region may have dramatically different reimbursement levels regardless of any differences among their patient populations. And finally, this system may force low-cost agencies to stop accepting patients with more serious health care needs. 
Mr. President, I realize that we cannot address every home health issue that has been raised this year. Some matters will have to carry over to the next Congress, and I fully intend to work with my colleagues next year on these items. Nonetheless, there are things we can do this year, and I believe that it is imperative that Congress act now to begin to address these problems. At least one agency in Maine has closed because the reimbursement levels under this system fell so short of its actual operating costs. Other cost-efficient agencies in my State are laying off staff or declining to accept new patients with more serious health conditions. 
Which brings us back to the central and most critical issue--the real losers in this situation are our seniors, since cuts of this magnitude simply cannot be sustained without ultimately affecting patient care. 
Mr. President, once again, I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee for his efforts on this difficult issue and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to commend Senator Campbell for his efforts to protect consumers from con artists who try to cheat Americans using deceptive mailings. I am pleased to join in support of his legislation. 
Senator Campbell's bill would require a disclosure on mailings to inform individuals that they have not automatically won a prize and that a purchase is not necessary to participate in a sweepstakes contest. New civil penalties could be imposed on violations of the provisions against sending deceptive mail. 
Senator Campbell has been a strong leader and forceful advocate for curtailing abuses by sweepstakes firms who send misleading mailings that suggest that people have won hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of dollars. Such deceptive mailings have caused people across the country to buy unnecessary products or to send money in the hope of winning a large prize. One scam even prompted some individuals to fly to Florida thinking they had won the grand prize in a major sweepstakes. 
Millions of Americans have received sweepstakes letters that use deceptive marketing ploys to encourage the purchase of magazines and other products. A common tactic is a promise of winnings printed in large type, such as: `You Were Declared One of Our Latest Sweepstakes Winners And You're About to Be Paid $833,337 in Cash!' Of course, the recipient isn't really a winner, as the fine print said the money is won only `If you have and return the grand prize winning number in time.' 
Another problem is what I call `government look-alike mailings,' which look deceptively like mailings from Federal agencies. An example of such a deceptive mailing was sent to be by a woman from Machiasport, Maine. The letter was marked `Urgent Delivery, A Special Notification of Cash Currently Being Held by the U.S. Government is ready for shipment to you.' A postcard asks the consumer to send $9.97 to learn how to receive this cash. Of course, this was not a legitimate mailing from the Federal Government, but simply a ploy used by an unscrupulous individual to trick an unsuspecting consumer into sending money. 
The experience of my constituents, as well as testimony presented by Senator Campbell and others at the hearing chaired by our colleague, Senator Cochran, convinced me that Congress must pass strong legislation to stop sweepstakes fraud and deceptive mailings. 
As Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I have focused our agenda on a number of consumer frauds, and I will be working with Senator Cochran to further examine the issue of deceptive mailings in the coming months. I commend Senator Campbell for his leadership and look forward to working with him on this issue next year.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as a Senator from a State with an excellent records of accomplishment at the secondary education level, but a discouraging low rate of participation in higher education, I am extremely pleased to rise in support of the conference report on the higher education act amendments of 1998. Mr. President, I have had no higher priority than bringing this important legislation to completion this year. 
I am very proud of the record of Maine's primary and secondary schools. We have one of the lowest high school dropout rates in the country, and we rank in the top third of the Nation for residents over 25 years old with high school diplomas. More important, the academic achievement of our schools is impressive. Education Week's `Quality Counts' assessment found that the performance of Maine's students in mathematics, science, and reading was at the very top of the Nation. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, there is one dark cloud in this otherwise very bright and sunny picture, and that is the low rate of participation in higher education by Maine's high school graduates. That low rate results not from a lack of interest or lack of ability, but rather from a lack of opportunity. The legislation we are considering today holds the key for young people of limited means to get through a door that, often for financial reasons, would otherwise remain closed to them. 
This reauthorization of the Higher Education Act continues the historic commitment begun 40 years ago when Congress enacted the National Defense Education Act. In the NDEA, Congress stated, `The security of the Nation requires the fullest development of the mental resources and technical skills of its young men and women.' 
In 1958, Congress was thinking of security in terms of the cold war and the recent launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union. However, Mr. President, this statement remains equally valid today--although the challenge to our national security is greatly different. Today, we face an internal threat--not the threat of the rapidly advancing technology of a foreign enemy, but the quiet threat of failing to provide educational opportunity to all our citizens. Those deprived of that opportunity lose the chance to participate in our Nation's bright, technology-based economic future. 
Given the well-established relationship between educational attainment and lifetime earnings, the consequences of not affording educational opportunity to lower-income Americans are predictable. Indeed, the result is a vicious cycle, in which the income gap leads to an education gap, which in turn leads to an even more pronounced income gap. Unless steps are taken to close the education gap, one that is rooted in economics rather than in ability, we lock the children of America's lower income families into a self-perpetuating cycle of inadequate education and low income. 
The Higher Education Act seeks to close that education gap. It assumes that all qualified high school students graduating are entitled to higher education and strives to make this a reality through a program of grants, guaranteed loans, and Opportunity Programs. 
The grant programs authorized by the Higher Education Act are the most important part of our attempt to assure access to higher education. Nationwide, Pell grants have assisted 
millions of students in obtaining postsecondary education. In Maine, 15,000 students were awarded $24 million in Pell Grants last year. In addition, Maine institutions received more than $6.5 million in Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants, which they distributed to the most needy students. 
My strong belief in the importance of grant aid in expanding access to higher education has led me to introduce several bills to increase the level of Pell Grants for which students can qualify. One of these bills, the Working Students Income Protection Act, eliminated an unfair penalty that is imposed on low-income students who work to pay part of their educational expenses--just the kind of thing we ought to be encouraging. The bill was incorporated, I am pleased to say, into the Higher Education Act Amendments and, as a result, students may now earn $2,000 a year more before their Pell Grants are reduced. 
The act also reflects my efforts to ensure that the formula used to calculate the amount of a student's Pell Grant reflects the true costs of dependent care. As we increase the maximum level of Pell Grants, we approach the point at which this arbitrary cap of $750, which is in the current law, would limit Pell Grants to some of the most deserving students--those balancing caring for their children and going to college. The changes in the Higher Education Act will prevent such students from having to choose between supporting their children and pursuing higher education. 
In addition to Pell Grants, the Higher Education Act has provided funding for a joint Federal-State effort to award grants to needy students. This program is known as the State Student Incentive Grants Program. This bill incorporates a proposal authored by Senator Reed of Rhode Island and myself to not only maintain this important program, but to expand it to fund a series of other State efforts to promote access to higher education for low-income students. This year, for every dollar in Federal SSIG funds, my State of Maine is contributing almost $50, and the result is that 10,000 students will receive a total of $5 million to further their education. 
Mr. President, the combined Federal and State grant aid based on the Higher Education Act totals more than $35 million to students in Maine who are enrolled in institutions of higher education. This represents a direct investment in equal opportunity and bright futures for Maine families. 
The other major financial assistance program in the Higher Education Act is the guaranteed student loan program. This reauthorization assures that students will continue to have access to both private loans, as well as those that come directly from the Department of Education, and it establishes the lowest interest rate in 17 years for guaranteed student loans. This is good news, indeed. 
Mr. President, unless individuals from disadvantaged social and economic backgrounds aspire to higher education, no amount of financial aid will help them. Therefore, in reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, we are continuing a very successful effort by the Federal Government to put higher education on the radar screens of disadvantaged youths through the Opportunity or Trio Programs. 
In my home State, TRIO programs, such as Talent Search and Upward Bound, have lifted the aspirations of thousands of young people who otherwise never would have even considered postsecondary education. I am very pleased to have worked for the extension and improvement of these programs along with the creation of an exciting new program known as Gear Up, through which colleges will reach out to entire middle school classes. 
I have had the opportunity to visit outstanding Upward Bound programs at both the University of Maine at Orono and the University of Maine at Presque Isle. The high school students in these programs were enthusiastic, challenged, and so excited about their opportunities. As one student told me, `No one in my family has ever been to college. I had no idea that college could be part of my future--Upward Bound has given me confidence and experience; it's opened my eyes to all sorts of new opportunities.' 
The Federal Government cannot guarantee equal educational achievement, but we can take steps and must take steps to guarantee equality of access by removing the barriers that prevent students from lower- and middle-income families from pursuing postsecondary education. That is the very purpose of the Higher Education Act. Its student loan programs have assisted countless students in overcoming the financial obstacles to higher education while its opportunity programs, such as Upward Bound, have an admirable record of breaking down the social and academic areas. 
Despite our successes, the statistics show that we have not yet done the job. The education gap still exists, and to close it we need to reaffirm and extend our commitment to equal access to education. Establishing equality of opportunity is the ultimate goal of the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. 
The American people expect their Government to prepare our Nation for the next century. I can think of no better way to carry out that responsibility than to assist today's young people in realizing their full potential to become not just productive members of society but also the leaders upon whom America's future depends. 
I am pleased to have played a role in bringing this very important legislation before the Senate today. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to engage my colleague from Michigan, the sponsor of the Child Custody Protection Act, in a colloquy to clarify the legislation's intent with regard to existing State parental notification laws. 
The State of Maine has a carefully constructed adult consent requirement. In my state, a minor under 18 may obtain an abortion with the informed consent of either one parent, a guardian or an adult family member. Absent that consent, she may obtain an abortion if she receives counseling from a physician, psychiatrist, ordained member of the clergy, nurse, physician's assistant or qualified counselor. She may also obtain an abortion without parental or adult family member consent by securing a court order. 
Will the legislation we are considering today in any way override or supersede Maine State law?

Ms. COLLINS. Opponents of this bill contend that health care providers in states like Maine that do not have a law requiring parental involvement could still be liable for conspiracy or as accomplices under this legislation. The liability would presumably apply when they perform or participate in performing an abortion on a minor brought into Maine in violation of the proposed statute. Is this analysis correct? Are there any circumstances under which Maine's health care providers performing or participating in the performance of what, under Maine state law, would be legal abortion on a minor, could be held liable under your bill? Would these providers have any new legal responsibilities as a consequence of the enactment of this legislation?

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining with my colleagues, Senators Durbin and Snowe, in introducing this bill to ban all late-term abortions, including partial birth abortions, that are not necessary to save the mother's life or to protect her from grievous physical harm. 
Let me be clear from the outset. I am strongly opposed to all late-term abortions, including partial birth abortions. I agree that they should be banned. However, I believe that an exception must be made for those rare cases when it is necessary to save the life of the mother or to protect her from grievous physical harm. Fortunately, these procedures are extremely rare in my State, where there were just two late-term abortions between 1984 and 1996. 
We believe that this debate should not be about one particular method of abortion, but rather about the larger question of under what circumstances should late-term, or post-viability, abortions be legally available. We believe that all late-term abortions--regardless of the procedure used--should be banned, except in those rare cases where the life or the physical health of the mother is at serious risk. 
In my view, Congress is ill-equipped to make judgments on specific medical procedures. As the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists--which represents over 90 percent of ob-gyns and which opposes the partial birth abortion ban--has said, `the intervention of legislative bodies into medical decision-making is inappropriate, ill advised, and dangerous.' Most politicians have neither the training nor the experience to decide which procedure is most appropriate in a given case. These medically difficult and highly personal decisions should be left for families to make in consultation with their doctors. 
The Supreme Court, in Roe v. Wade, has identified `viability'--the point at which the fetus is capable of sustaining life outside the womb with or without support--as the defining point in determining the constitutionality of restrictions on abortion. While I don't believe that it is appropriate for us to dictate medical practice, I do believe that it is appropriate for Congress to determine the circumstances under which access to late-term abortions--by any procedure--should be restricted. 
That is what the legislation we are introducing today would do. Our bill goes beyond the partial birth abortion ban, which simply prohibits a specific medical procedure and will not prevent a single abortion. Let me emphasize that point. The partial birth legislation would not prevent a single late-term abortion. A physician could simply use another, perhaps more dangerous method to end the pregnancy. 
By contrast, our bill would prohibit the abortion of any viable fetus, by any method, unless that abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the mother or to prevent `grievous injury' to her physical health. We have taken great care to tightly limit the health exception in this bill to `grievous injury' to the mother's physical health. It would not allow late-term abortions to be performed simply because the woman is depressed or feeling stressed or has a minor health problem because of the pregnancy. 
`Grievous injury' is narrowly and strictly defined by our bill as either a `severely debilitating disease or impairment specifically caused by the 
pregnancy,' or `an inability to provide necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition.' Moreover, `grievous injury' does not include any condition that is not medically diagnosable or any condition for which termination of the pregnancy is not medically indicated. 
This bill includes an additional safeguard. The initial opinion of the treating physician that the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health must be confirmed by a `second opinion.' This second opinion must come from an independent physician who will not be involved in the abortion procedure and who has not been involved in the treatment of the mother. This second physician must also certify--in writing--that, in his or her medical judgment, the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health. 
What we are talking about are the severe, medically diagnosable threats to a woman's physical health that are sometimes brought on or aggravated by pregnancy. 
Let me give you a few examples: primary pulmonary hypertension, which can cause sudden death or intractable congestive heart failure; severe pregnancy-aggravated hypertension with accompanying kidney or liver failure; complications from aggravated diabetes such as amputation or blindness; or an inability to treat aggressive cancers such as leukemia, breast cancer, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma. 
These are all obstetric conditions that are cited in the medical literature as possible indications for pregnancy terminations. In these extremely rare cases--where the mother has been certified by two physicians to be at risk of losing her life or suffering grievous physical harm--I believe that we should leave the very difficult decisions about what should be done to the best judgment of the women, families and physicians involved. 
Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today is a fair and compassionate compromise on this extremely difficult issue. It would ensure that all late-term abortions--including partial birth abortions--are strictly limited to those rare and tragic cases where the life or the physical health of the mother is in serious jeopardy, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. This legislation presents an unusual opportunity for both `pro-choice' and `pro-life' advocates to work together on a reasonable approach. 
I also ask unanimous consent that a recent editorial from the Bangor Daily News endorsing our approach be included in the Congressional Record at the conclusion of my remarks.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to start by commending the Senator from Wisconsin for his leadership and thanking him for his kind comments. 
It is with a renewed sense of enthusiasm that I rise today to urge this body to pass much-needed reforms to our campaign finance laws. I am buoyed by the courage shown by my Republican colleagues in the House who were willing to put their commitment to good government ahead of their parochial interests. 
Mr. President, this amendment is needed because the twin loopholes of soft money and bogus issue ads have virtually obliterated our campaign finance laws, leaving us with little more than a pile of legal rubble. We supposedly have restrictions on how much individuals can contribute to political parties; yet, at last year's hearings before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, we heard from one individual who gave $325,000 to the Democratic National Committee in order to secure a picture with the President of the United States. Another mockingly testified that the next time he is willing to spend $600,000, rather than $300,000, to purchase access to the White House. 
We supposedly prohibit corporations and unions from financing political campaigns; yet, the AFL-CIO reportedly spent $800,000 in Maine on so-called issue ads which anyone with an ounce of common sense recognized were designed to defeat a candidate for Congress. And as reported in Sunday's Washington Post, when the class action lawyers collect their tens of billions in fees from the tobacco lawsuits, the resulting flood of cash to the Democratic Party will make past contributions look like pocket change. 
We in this body decry legal loopholes, but we have reserved the largest ones for ourselves. Indeed, these are more like black holes, and that sucking sound you hear during election years is the whoosh of six-figure soft money donations rushing into party coffers. 
Why should this matter, we are asked by those all too eager to equate freedom of speech with freedom to spend? It should matter because political equality is the essence of democracy, and an electoral system fueled by money is one lacking in political equality. 
Mr. President, the hope of Maine support campaign finance reform. If my colleagues will indulge me a bit of home state pride, I think the Maine perspective results from old fashion, Down East common sense. Maine people are able to see through the complexities of this debate and focus on what is at heart a very simple, yet very profound, problem. As long as we allow unlimited contributions--whether in the form of hard or soft money--and as long as we allow unlimited expenditures, we will not have political equality in this country. It is not just that there will not be a level playing field for those seeking public office, but more important, there will not be a level playing field for those seeking access to their government. 
The Maine attitude may well be shaped by the fact that many people in my state live in communities where town meetings are still held each year. I am not talking about the staged, televised town meeting that has become so fashionable of late. I am talking about a rough and tumble meeting held in the high school gym or in the grange hall. Attend one of these meetings and you will observe an element of true democracy; people with more money do not get to speak longer or louder than people with less money. Unfortunately, what is true at Maine town meetings is not true in Washington. 
Mr. President, the amendment pending before this body is dramatically different from the original McCain-Feingold bill. It does not seek to radically alter how we finance our campaigns. Indeed, it does not alter at all the basic framework that Congress established more than two decades ago in the 1970s. 
Before us today is legislation designed simply to close election law loopholes that undermine the protections the American people were promised in the aftermath of Watergate. Put differently, this amendment does not create new reforms, but merely restores reforms adopted two decades ago. 
Let me be more specific. Gone from this version of the legislation are the voluntary limits on how much a campaign can spend. Gone is the free TV time, as well as the reduced TV time. Gone is the reduction in PAC limits. Gone are the restrictions on certain types of so-called issue ads run by nonprofit organizations, replaced instead by a requirement that they disclose their sources of funding. 
Most of these continue to be very important reforms to which I remain personally committed. But in the interest of securing action on the major abuses in the current system, we who support the McCain-Feingold proposal have agreed to significant compromises. This is now a modest bill but nevertheless, a critical first step in the journey toward reform. 
Mr. President, history demonstrates that the current uses of soft money and issue ads were not intended by the framers of our election laws. Go back to the early 1980s when soft money was used only for party overhead and organizational expenses, and you will find that the contributions totaled a few million dollars. By contrast, in the last election cycle when soft money took on its current role, these contributions exceeded $250 million. 
Bogus issue ads were such a small element in the past that it is impossible to find reliable estimates of the amounts expended on them. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case, and these expenditures have now become worthy of studies, the most prominent of which estimates that as much as $150 million dollars was spent on these ads in 1995-96. 
When I ran for a seat in this body, I advocated major changes to our campaign finance laws, but I recognize that goal must wait for another time. The challenge before us today is far more modest. Are we prepared to address loopholes that subvert the intent of the election laws that we enacted more than two decades ago? Are we willing to restore to the American people the campaign finance system that rightfully belongs to them? 
Those are the questions before this body. Mr. President, a strong majority of the Members of the House of Representatives support reform as do a majority of the Members of the Senate. I would hope that the Senate this week will finally vote to reform a loophole-ridden system. The American people deserve no less. 
Mr. President, it remains to be seen whether campaign finance reform is an idea whose time has come. But I can assure my colleagues of one thing--it is an idea that will not die. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support the McCain-Feingold amendment, and I am proud to be a cosponsor. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise to join the senior Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, in urging my colleagues to approve the conference report on H.R. 629, legislation that would ratify the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact, known as the Texas Compact. 
In entering into an agreement for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, the States of Maine, Texas, and Vermont followed the direction established by the Congress in the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act and its 1985 amendments. That legislation contemplated that States would form agreements of this nature for the disposal of low-level waste, and thus, by ratifying the compact, Congress will be completing a process that it set in motion. 
Since 1985, Congress has ratified 9 compacts involving 41 States. Put differently, 82 of the 100 Members of this body live in States with compacts that have already been ratified by the Senate, and with the approval of the Texas Compact, that number will rise to 88. In short, what Maine, Texas, and Vermont are seeking today has already been routinely granted in the vast majority of States. 
While the disposal of radioactive waste is bound to generate controversy, this agreement has been overwhelmingly approved by the legislatures of the three compacting States, signed by their Governors, and, in the case of the State of Maine, endorsed by voters in a referendum. This is consistent with the congressional determination that the States bear responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste and that, in the interest of limiting the number of disposal sites, they work together to carry out this responsibility. Indeed, ratification by Congress is necessitated only because State-imposed limitations on the importation of waste would otherwise violate the commerce clause. 
Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota, whom I enjoy serving with on the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, has criticized the disposal site that is under consideration by the State of Texas. Apart from the fact that the location of the site is a matter for Texas to determine and is not a component of this bill, that criticism is unsupported by the facts. 
In making the decision to consider the proposed site in Hudspeth County, TX, there has been extensive public involvement as well as a thorough environmental and technical review. The county was found to have two critical characteristics for a disposal site; namely, very little rainfall and very low population density. Indeed, the county is the size of the State of Connecticut and has a population of only 2,800 people, and it must be remembered, Mr. President, that this is only a proposed site. Final approval will not be forthcoming unless all of the standards established by Texas law are satisfied. 
The decision to consider the site in Texas has nothing to do with who lives there. It has everything to do with the fact that very few people live there. 
This body has been presented with nine low-level radioactive waste compacts. It has not imposed changes on any one of those agreements. In keeping with congressionally established policy for the disposal of low-level waste, Maine, Texas, and Vermont are simply seeking the same treatment. 
I commend my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, for her leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support the conference report. I yield the floor.

I am concerned about the burden that the CRA imposes on our small community banks. It is my understanding, however, based on the representations of the chairman and a letter from the administration, that if this amendment is adopted, it will lead to the veto of this legislation, which I strongly support. 
So I find myself in a real quandary. I support the amendment of the Senator from Alabama, yet I strongly support the underlying bill and do not want to jeopardize it being signed into law. 
Could the distinguished chairman give me assurances that he is willing to work with me, with the Senator from Alabama, and others who are concerned about easing this burden on our small banks?

Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator very much for his assurances. This is a matter of great concern for me. I would very much like to vote for this amendment, but in view of the fact that the President has made it very clear he would veto the bill if it were included, I, unfortunately, am going to have to vote against the amendment. 
I thank the Senator.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we must replace this country's Byzantine and loophole-ridden Tax Code. How can anyone stand on the floor of this Senate and defend it? Just look at our current Tax Code. It has been estimated that it takes Americans 5.4 billion hours to do their taxes. Our Tax Code currently consists of nearly 3 million words backed up by nearly 10 million words of regulations. It is impossible to understand, which is why it cost taxpayers an astounding $150 billion a year to comply with. 
Our Tax Code is riddled with loopholes that benefit special interests at the expense of the general interest. Special interests have filled the code with countless loopholes, poorly constructed tax writeoffs, and expensive subsidies that benefit a few at the expense of the many. 
Mr. President, our Tax Code is not like a fine wine that gets better with age. It is more like a woolen sweater in a closet full of moths. It acquires more and more holes all of the time, and after a while, you just can't keep on mending it. You have to throw it out. 
We want to write a new Tax Code that will provide all Americans with a simpler, fairer Tax Code, a Tax Code that they deserve. And we want to do it by Independence Day 2002. 
Mr. President, I have been in the Senate about a year and a half now. If there is one thing I have learned, it is that the Senate never takes action--that the Congress never acts unless there is a deadline. The Senator from Montana knows that better than most people. Does he really think that we would have acted to reauthorize ISTEA, the transportation bill that he worked so hard on with the Senator from Rhode Island without a deadline, without the existing law expiring unless we act? 
We are in a deadline situation right now as we rush to complete work before the August recess. We all know what happens towards the end of the fiscal year as we rush to complete work on the funding business to keep our Government open. The fact is, Mr. President, that this Congress will not act to do the necessary step of reforming our Tax Code without a deadline. 
It is not irresponsible to allow 4 1/2 years for this task to be undertaken. We are not prejudging the results. We are not saying that the result has to be a national tax or some other possibility. What we are saying is that America deserves a Tax Code that we can be proud of. And the only way we are going to accomplish that goal is if we set a deadline. 
Mr. President, the Tax Code is not going to expire overnight. We are not proposing sunsetting it tomorrow, or next month, or even next year. What we have laid out is over a 4-year period an adequate amount of time to carefully and responsibly craft an alternative of which America can be proud. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important legislation. 
No one--let me repeat that--no one is going to allow our current Tax Code to expire without a responsible alternative in place. But if we are going to restore public confidence in Government, we must start by ending the current Tax Code as we know it, and by crafting a well-thought-out and responsible alternative. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor, and I urge my colleagues to support this very worthwhile initiative. I commend the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator in the Chair for their work in this area. 
Thank you. I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment introduced by my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, to strengthen the capability of our law enforcement community to protect older women from violence. 
There is no conduct less consistent with the precepts of a civilized society than the physical abuse of those unable to defend themselves. Our recognition of this has led to an aggressive and ongoing campaign against child abuse, and it must lead to an equally strong response to domestic violence directed at older Americans. 
Mr. President, at a 1995 hearing in Portland, Maine, chaired by my predecessor, Senator Cohen, elder abuse was aptly described as `society's secret shame.' Family violence, particularly when directed at the elderly, was a major concern of Senator Cohen, and I welcome the opportunity to continue his efforts to combat this intolerable mistreatment of older Americans. 
Mr. President, earlier this year my home state released its crime statistics for 1997. I was cheered by the wonderful news that crime fell by 8.7% from 1996, to the lowest rate in at least 20 years. Hidden behind this positive statistic, however, was one that was very disquieting, namely, that domestic violence increased by 7.8%. Ironically, at the same time as we are becoming less likely to be harmed by strangers, many of our neighbors face an increasing threat from members of their own households. 
National data demonstrate that cases of domestic elder abuse, which includes neglect as well as physical abuse, are steadily increasing. From 1986 to 1996, the number of cases went from 117,000 to 293,000, an increase of 150%. Furthermore, there is widespread agreement that this type of abuse is greatly underreported. For example, although the number of reported cases in 1994 was 241,000, the National Center on Elder Abuse estimates that the true number of cases was 818,000. 
Mr. President, while these numbers indicate a serious and growing problem, all of the statistics in the world do not describe the problem as eloquently as the words of a single victim. At the Maine hearing, one such victim told what happened to her at the hands of her husband after her children left home. 
[T]hings got really bad. I had two broken wrists, cracked ribs, held down with his knee on my chest with a knife at my throat. I was made to crawl across the floor with a gun resting on my head, ready to fire. I've been choked until I was limp, and then he would drop me on the floor with a kick. I've been spit on, thrown through a window, dragged into the lake as he said he was going to drown me. 
Astonishingly, but not atypically, the witness was married to her husband for 44 years. 
Mr. President, this type of treatment cannot be tolerated. As a cosponsor of the Durbin amendment, I sincerely hope that my colleagues will take this modest step to enhance the ability of the law enforcement community to protect this vulnerable segment of our society.

 Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the UNUM Corporation on its 150th Anniversary. 
UNUM is based in Portland, Maine, has offices across America and around the globe, and enjoys a reputation for excellence throughout the world. 
July 17, 1998 marks the 150th Anniversary of the UNUM Corporation, a company incorporated in Maine in 1848 as Union Mutual Life Insurance Company. 
Throughout the past 150 years, UNUM has stayed true to the charge of its founder Elisha B. Pratt to `find the better way' and is known today as the company that `sees farther.' 
UNUM has become the world leader in disability insurance and consistently ranks among the best places to work in America. 
UNUM has chosen to celebrate its July 17 anniversary by having thousands of its employees volunteer a `Day of Sharing' to more than 200 community service projects in six countries. 
UNUM's `Day of Sharing' builds on a record of community partnership that includes contributing more than 75,000 employee volunteer hours during each of the past five years and the UNUM Foundation contributing $2 million to community programs last year alone. 
Not only is UNUM an outstanding and exemplary business leader, providing insurance protection to its customers, it is also an invaluable community partner, improving the communities where its employees have lived and worked for 150 years. 
Today, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in congratulating and commending UNUM on its 150th anniversary and its outstanding achievements as a business leader and community partner.

Mr. President, I rise today to thank the Senator from Mississippi, the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, for so generously honoring my request to support the USDA-Agricultural Research Service's New England Plant, Soil, and Water Research Laboratory, which is located at the University of Maine. I am very pleased that the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee has recommended that this important agriculture research worksite be kept open, despite the administration's misguided attempt to close the facility and curtail its funding. 
I am also happy that the distinguished chairman has agreed to my request to provide a $300,000 increase in the lab's funding to hire new scientists at the Cropping Systems Center to develop production and disease management systems.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, to continue the colloquy with the distinguished chairman, I again thank him very much for his support. I would like to point out the research conducted at the University of Maine is particularly vital because of the 104 USDA-ARS labs across the country, the laboratory located in Orono, ME, is the only one in New England. The facility is thus able to conduct research on the unique challenges that face our New England farmers. 
Specifically, the lab at Orono has conducted research into raised bed techniques that allow potatoes to be grown in the short New England growing season, as well as into disease and pest management. 
The potato industry in New England, 95 percent of which is located in northern Maine where I grew up, is suffering through a difficult period. Underpriced subsidized imports and several consecutive years of disease, drought and pest problems have resulted in a steady decline in the amount of acreage planted in potatoes. The additional $300,000 included in the managers' amendment will allow the lab to hire a new pathologist and microbiologist to help New England farmers to overcome many of the challenges they face. I look forward to working with my colleague to enact this significant legislation and, again, I commend and thank him for acceding to our request in this regard.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, diabetes is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease affecting more than 16 million Americans at a cost of more than $137 billion annually. That is more than the cost of treating any other disease. Moreover, since 3 million elderly Medicare beneficiaries have been diagnosed with diabetes, and another 3 million are likely to have it but not realize it at this point, nowhere is the economic impact of diabetes felt more strongly than in our Medicare Program. 
Treating seniors for the often devastating complications associated with diabetes accounts for more than one-quarter of all Medicare expenses. Therefore, helping diabetic seniors avoid the complications of their disease will not only greatly improve the quality of their lives, but also help reduce the economic burden that diabetes places on the Medicare Program. This, Mr. President, is essential to the long-term economic viability of Medicare. 
While there is no known cure, diabetes is largely a treatable disease. Many people who have diabetes can lead completely normal, active lives as long as they stick to a proper diet, carefully monitor the amount of their blood sugar or glucose, and take their medicine, which may or may not include insulin. 
However, Mr. President, unfortunately, if a person with diabetes does not follow this rather strict regimen, they put themselves at risk of blindness, loss of limbs and an increased chance of heart disease, kidney failure, and stroke. Therefore, appropriate preventive services for diabetes have the potential to save a great deal of money that otherwise would go for hospitalization or other acute care costs--not to mention a great deal of unnecessary pain and suffering. 
Mr. President, Congress recently took a number of important steps to improve Medicare coverage of preventive care for individuals with diabetes. Prior to enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Medicare covered diabetes self-maintenance education services in inpatient or hospital-based settings and in limited outpatient settings, specifically hospital outpatient departments or rural health clinics. 
Medicare did not, however, cover education services if they were given in any other outpatient setting, such as a physician's office. Moreover, while Medicare did cover the cost of blood-testing strips used to monitor the sugar in the blood, it did so only for type I diabetics who required insulin to control their disease. Last year's Balanced Budget Act rightly expanded Medicare to cover all outpatient self-management training services as well as providing uniform coverage of blood-testing strips for all people with diabetes. 
With the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act, we made significant progress toward improving care for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes. However, Mr. President, there is more that we can do. 
External insulin infusion pumps have proven to be more effective at controlling blood glucose levels than conventional injection therapy for many insulin-dependent diabetics. This helps them to avoid the expensive complications and the suffering resulting from uncontrolled diabetes. However, Mr. President, Medicare currently does not cover these pumps, even in cases where they have been prescribed as medically necessary by the Medicare beneficiary's physician. I am, therefore, today pleased to introduce legislation, the Medicare Insulin Pump Coverage Act of 1998, that would expand Medicare coverage to cover insulin infusion pumps for certain type I diabetics. 
External insulin pumps are neither investigational nor experimental. They are widely accepted by health care professionals involved in treating patients with diabetes. Moreover, studies such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial sponsored by NIH have established that maintaining blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible is the key to preventing the devastating complications of diabetes. 
For many patients, Mr. President, the use of an infusion pump is the only way that optimal blood glucose control can be achieved safely and effectively. That is why virtually all other third-party payers--including most State Medicaid programs and CHAMPUS--cover the device. Moreover, there is precedent under the Medicare Program itself for covering the pump. Medicare currently covers infusion pumps for numerous cancer drugs as well as for pain control medications. 
Mr. President, I first became interested in this problem because of the experience of one of my constituents, Nona Frederich of Raymond, ME. She is an example of the kind of Medicare patient who would benefit from the pump. She is currently, unfortunately, being denied what is for her the most effective form of glucose control. 
Nona has been an insulin-dependent diabetic since 1962. Because of her extremely volatile insulin sensitivity, her diabetic specialist placed her on an insulin infusion pump in January of 1982. Until she reached age 65, the cost of the pump and operating supplies was underwritten in large part by her insurer, Colorado Blue-Cross-Blue Shield, and later by Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Maine. 
In March of 1995, it became necessary for Nona to purchase a new infusion pump. By now, however, she was older and on Medicare. Much to her surprise, Medicare refused to cover the pump, even though her doctor had prescribed it as clearly being medically necessary to help control her diabetes. Since then, with the help of my Portland office staff, the Frederichs have worked their way through the Health Care Financing Administration's system of appeals. Unfortunately, in January of this year, they received final notification of a negative decision by the Department of Health and Human Services. Their only option now is to file a civil suit, which they are simply not in a position to pursue. 
The Frederichs literally have notebooks filled with documentation of the procedures they have followed and the evidence they have submitted. Moreover, they have personally paid close to $5,000 in original pump costs and supplies for which they have received no reimbursement under the Medicare Program. For a Medicare beneficiary with limited income, these kinds of costs can be devastating. They can place the pump completely out of reach, even though the pump is medically necessary. In such a case, such patients would be forced to return to or continue with conventional insulin therapy which simply may not be as effective in controlling their blood sugar. As a consequence, these patients are admitted to the hospital with complications over and over again. The irony is that then Medicare will pick up the bill, and a far higher bill it will be than if Medicare had paid for the pump in the first place. 
While potentially devastating for an individual, the financial cost to Medicare of expanding coverage to include the insulin-infusion pump would be relatively minor. Under my bill, the pump would have to be prescribed by a physician and the beneficiary would have to be a Type-I diabetic, `experiencing severe swings of high and low blood glucose levels.' Of the estimated 3 million Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes, only about 5 percent are Type-I, or insulin-dependent. Of these, it is estimated the pump would be appropriate for only about 4 percent. But what a difference it would make in the lives of those 4 percent. 
The American Diabetes Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Association of Diabetes Educators, as well as officials at the Centers for Disease Control, have all advocated expanding Medicare to cover insulin pumps for Type-I diabetics who would otherwise have great difficulty in controlling their blood sugar. 
I am very pleased to be introducing this legislation today to do just that. I urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors. 
I ask that the text of the bill be entered into the record.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important legislation, and I want to commend the Senator from Vermont, the chairman of the committee, for his work in bringing this very important legislation to the floor. 
Mr. President, today we continue a historic commitment which began 40 years ago when Congress enacted the National Defense Education Act. 
In 1958, the NDEA provided that: `The security of the Nation requires the fullest development of the mental resources and technical skills of its young men and women.' At that time, Congress was thinking of security in terms of the cold war and was reacting to the Soviet Union's stunning achievement in launching Sputnik. 
Although the cold war is behind us now, the sentiments expressed in 1958 remain valid today. The threat may no longer be as dramatic as the threat posed by the technological advancements of a hostile superpower; instead, the threat that we face today is a quiet threat of lost opportunity--economically, culturally, and socially--a threat that will be realized if we fail to provide educational opportunities to our citizens. 
As a Senator from a State with a very high rate of high school completion but a very low rate of participation in higher education, I am particularly concerned about the threat that the lack of access to higher education poses to the future well-being of many of our lower-income citizens. 
We know, Mr. President, that fewer people from lower-income families enroll in postsecondary education. The problems caused by the lack of access, however, do not stop once we get students to campus. Another challenge is keeping them there and encouraging them to graduate. 
The disturbing truth, Mr. President, is that students who find college least affordable are much less likely to complete college than their financially more secure counterparts. As the Educational Testing Service's Policy Information Center has reported, `The education staircase . . . is getting steeper and harder to climb, particularly for those in lower income groups.' 
The center has reported the alarming fact that students from lower-income backgrounds, in addition to having much lower rates of entrance into college, have much higher dropout rates than those from higher-income families. 
In 1979, a student in the top quartile of family income was four times more likely to obtain a baccalaureate degree by age 24 than a student from the bottom quartile. 
By 1994, Mr. President, this problem, this gap, had gotten much worse. Individuals from the top quartile were 10 times more likely to attain a 4-year degree by age 24. 
When you couple this statistic with the well-established relationship between educational attainment and lifetime earnings, the consequences of the education gap are obvious. We keep reading about the gap between the rich and the poor in this country and that that gap is growing. That gap is, by and large, an education gap. 
If we are able to provide educational opportunities to lower-income families, we will help close that gap, because the differences in the lifetime earnings of people who complete only high school versus those who go on to postsecondary education are enormous. We are at risk of creating a permanent underclass of people without the skills that open the gateways to economic opportunity, the skills that allow entry into a job market demanding a higher-educated and better-trained workforce. In fact, Mr. President, it is estimated that in the State of Maine more than 80 percent of the new jobs being created require some sort of postsecondary education. 
Unless steps are taken to close this educational gap, a gap rooted in economics rather than in intelligence or ability, we are locking the children of America's lower-income families into a self-perpetuating cycle of inadequate education and low-income status. Without educational opportunities, a significant part of American society will never have the chance to participate fairly in America's bright technology-based future. 
Mr. President, the legislation before us, the Higher Education Act reauthorization, will help provide these educational opportunities. I would like to highlight some specific provisions in this legislation that I worked on and believe are critical. These provisions increase access to education by focusing on two components--first, helping families afford education; and, second, increasing the aspirations of our young people, particularly those who come from families where higher education is not a tradition. 
Mr. President, the Pell Grant Program has been one of the Federal Government's greatest contributions to the success of higher education. Over the last 25 years, this program has provided invaluable assistance to tens of millions of our neediest students. 
The Pell Grant Program has, however, had some flaws. Most notably, under its current formula, the program creates a disincentive to work. This was brought home to me when I talked to a young person who had decided to take a year off between high school and college in order to earn more money for her education. She worked at McDonald's and lived at home, saved every penny. The consequence was that she lost her Pell grant when she went to school the next year. 
We have created, in the current formula, a disincentive, because we have a very low cap on allowable earnings which penalizes students who are trying to pay for their education through work rather than relying solely on loans. 
Earlier this year, I introduced the Working Students Income Protection Act to address this problem. I am very pleased that the Labor and Human Resources Committee has incorporated my bill into the final version of the legislation before us today. It will increase by $1,000 the earnings allowance for students who receive Pell grants. 
Another important provision improving the Pell grant that is included in this legislation is the elimination of the dependent care cap that had been included in the formula in the past. Again, I introduced legislation to make this change because I was concerned that as we increase the maximum level of aid, we end up limiting Pell grant awards to some of the most needy students, those who have child care expenses. Often these are single parents who are balancing raising children, going to work, and attending college. The changes that are included in this bill will make it a little bit easier for these students. 
Another provision of this bill includes legislation that Senator Reed of Rhode Island and I have authored to strengthen the State Student Incentive Grant Program. This program provides assistance to 12,000 Maine students who come from families whose average income is under $12,000. 
Mr. President, as important as all this financial assistance is--and I know from my experience working in a Maine college that it is critical--there is another significant barrier to higher education for a lot of our young people. 
If students come from a disadvantaged social or economic background, and come from families where there is no experience with higher education, they may look at college as being beyond their reach. It may be a frightening experience for them or something they simply do not consider, despite having the ability to succeed. 
In reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, we are continuing one of the Federal Government's most successful efforts, and that is the TRIO Programs. In my home State, TRIO Programs such as Talent Search and Upward Bound have identified and reached out to promising young people who otherwise never would have considered postsecondary education but for these terrific programs. Two-thirds of the students benefiting from the TRIO Programs come from families where neither parent has any higher education and whose families' incomes are below $24,000. 
One such student, Mr. President, recently visited me. She was a young woman from Greene, ME, who talked with such excitement about the benefit of the Talent Search Program to her aspirations. She said that the program had convinced her that she wants to go to college. This young woman comes from a low-income family. Neither of her parents went to college. In fact, her mother was a teenage mother who dropped out of high school to raise her children. This young woman put it very well. She said, `But for this program, but for the Talent Search Program, I would have been too frightened to go to college. I would have just assumed that it wasn't for me.' This program, by exposing her to a college environment, by giving her the counseling, the mentoring, and the encouragement that she needed, has convinced her that higher education will be part of her future. I am convinced that it will be a bright future indeed. 
It is difficult for me to think of a more worthwhile investment of Federal funds than these important programs. The Federal Government cannot guarantee equal educational attainment for every student, but we can certainly take steps that will guarantee equality of access for every student. We can help eliminate the barriers of cost and inadequate aspirations that prevent students from lower- and middle-income families from pursuing postsecondary education. We can give them equal opportunity by providing the access through the important programs in this legislation. 
The Higher Education Act that is before the Senate today will help our citizens overcome economic and social barriers, take advantage of education, and reach their full potential. That not only benefits them as individuals, it benefits our Nation as a society, as well. 
Today I encourage my colleagues to join in affirming and extending the commitment for access to education that we began 40 years ago. 
I thank the President for the time, and I thank the chairman for his efforts, as well. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to those who have already spoken in support of the defense authorization bill. Providing for the common defense is the single most important responsibility of a national government. If we fail in this regard, all the other aspects of our public policy become irrelevant. I am particularly pleased with the significant role that my own State of Maine plays in our national defense. 
The legislation brought to us by the Armed Services Committee--and I commend the leaders of the committee for their tremendous efforts--recognizes Maine's contributions in a number of ways. Perhaps none is more significant than the contribution of the State of Maine in the field of naval shipbuilding. This is where the skill and the dedication of Maine workers at Bath Iron Works provide the U.S. Navy with state-of-the-art Arleigh Burke class destroyers, the backbone of our destroyer fleet. Fortunately, this bill ensures this will be true for years to come, because the legislation continues the Navy's multiyear procurement program for the Arleigh Burke class. 
The bill also provides funding for the new LPD-17 amphibious ship which will be built in Bath and will help the Marine Corps maintain its local reach for years to come. 
Moreover, this bill provides continued funding for the Navy's next generation of destroyers, the DD-21. With the DD-21, Mainers will continue to play a pivotal role on the cutting edge of American sea power through Bath's participation in the `shipbuilding alliance' that will construct this powerful and innovative new ship for our 21st-century Navy. 
Other provisions of importance to my State increase funding to modernize and reconfigure the Navy's P-3 maritime patrol aircraft. This should permit these tried-and-true workhorses of naval aviation, operating out of bases such as the Brunswick Naval Air Station in Maine, to continue protecting our security for years to come. This bill also recognizes and supports the contributions of a number of very important defense contractors in Maine, including Saco Defense, Pratt & Whitney and Fiber Materials International of Biddeford. 
Furthermore, having learned a great deal about the extraordinary high-tech chemical and biological sensor laboratory at the University of Maine, I am also proud of the groundbreaking role Maine is playing in this crucial field. Recent events in Iraq and elsewhere illustrate the grave threats posed by the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, the so-called poor man's atomic bomb. If we are to protect Americans against such threats, our troops in the field and our citizens at home need access to small, portable, state-of-the-art sensors capable of detecting such threats quickly and efficiently. I am proud that the University of Maine and Maine companies, such as Sensor Research & Development, are playing such an important role in preparing to meet this need and that this legislation supports funding for this important research program and other very significant defense projects at the University of Maine. 
Maine will also contribute to our national defense in the development of advanced composite materials--a field in which Fiber Materials International, of Biddeford, Maine, is a world leader. From structural skin elements of advanced NASA spacecraft to the nose tips and other components for a whole generation of high-tech missile systems, FMI provides this country with the very best in fiber composite materials. Another world leader from Maine is the Pratt & Whitney plant in South Berwick, Maine, which produces engine components for the F-15 Eagle. 
I should also note that this bill also aims to help ensure that the Defense Finance and Accounting Service meets its cost-cutting goals in a responsible manner--by requiring a careful study of how best to balance DFAS infrastructure reductions before the Department of Defense undertakes any such cuts. This ought to help Maine, and other states, avoid any unfair burden from cuts in facilities such as the award-winning DFAS center in Limestone, Maine. I commend my colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, for her amendment requiring this study. 
As a state with one of the highest per-capita populations of veterans in the country, Maine will also gain from this bill's provision for three demonstration projects designed to help the Department of Defense determine the best way to provide health care to Medicare-eligible veterans over the age of 65. Among the demonstration projects this language would authorize is an effort to extend FEHBP benefits to Medicare-eligible veterans. This provision is itself modeled upon a bill introduced by Senator Bond which I have cosponsored. Through such demonstration projects, we hope to be able to fill a significant gap in the health care our country provides to military retirees. 
As a final observation, I would like to point out that this defense authorization bill also includes language I introduced that will release federal interests in the Kennebec Arsenal in Augusta, Maine. The national government actually transferred this property to Maine nearly a century ago, but this conveyance had a number of strings attached--among them the requirement that the land only be used for a mental hospital. Today, these conditions are wholly obsolete, and this historic site is in great need of repair and historical preservation. The language I introduced which has been incorporated into the defense authorization bill will finally release the Kennebec Arsenal, without conditions, to the people of Maine. Augusta, ME, has very exciting plans for renovating this historic structure. 
All in all, this defense authorization bill represents far-sighted thinking about the challenges of U.S. defense policy in the years ahead. For this alone, it deserves our support. I am however, particularly pleased that this bill recognizes Maine's role in our defense preparedness and our state's pivotal position on the forefront of defense research and development, and that it builds upon them in order to ensure our security in the 21st Century. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I, again, salute the leaders of the Armed Services Committee for their impressive efforts. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act of 1998, which is intended to address some of the problems that small family practice residency programs in Maine and elsewhere are experiencing as a result of provisions in the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 that were intended to control the growth in Medicare graduate medical education spending. 
Of specific concern are the provisions in the BBA that cap the total number of residents in a program at the level included in the 1996 Medicare cost reports. Congress' goal in reforming Medicare's graduate medical education program was to slow down our nation's overall production of physicians, while still protecting the training of physicians who are in short supply and needed to meet local and national health care demands. While it is true that the BBA's provisions will curb growth in the overall physician supply, they do so indiscriminately and are thwarting efforts in Maine and elsewhere to increase the supply of primary care physicians in underserved rural areas. 
Because Maine has only one medical school--the University of New England, which trains osteopathic physicians--we depend on a number of small family practice residency programs to introduce physicians to the practice opportunities in the state. Most of the graduates of these residency programs go on to establish practices in Maine, many in rural and underserved areas of the state. The new caps on residency slots included in the BBA penalize these programs in a number of ways. 
For instance, the current cap is based on the number of interns and residents who were `in the hospital' in FY 1996. Having a cap that is institution-specific rather than program-specific has caused several problems. For instance, the Maine-Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program had two residents out on leave in 1996--one on sick leave for chemotherapy treatments and one on maternity leave. Therefore, the program's cap was reduced by two, because it was based on the number of actual residents in the hospital in 1996 as opposed to the number of residents in the program. 
Moreover, residents in this program have spent one to two months training in obstetrics at Dartmouth's Mary Hitchcock's Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Because the cap is based on a hospital's cost report, these residents are counted toward Dartmouth Medical School's cap instead of the Maine-Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program's. Last year, the Maine program was informed that Dartmouth would be cutting back the amount of time their residents are there. But the Maine-Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program has no way of recouping the resident count from them in order to have the funds to support obstetrical training for their residents elsewhere. 
Moreover, the cap does not include residents who continue to be part of the residency program, but who have been sent outside of the hospital for training. This penalizes all primary care specialties, but especially family medicine, where ambulatory training has historically been the hallmark of the specialty. This is particularly ironic since other specialty programs that now begin training in settings outside the hospital will, under the new rules, have those costs included in their Medicare graduate medical education funding. 
All told, the Maine Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program will see its graduate medical education funding reduced by over half a million dollars a year as a result of the cap established by the BBA. 
The example I have just used is from Maine, but the problems created by the BBA's graduate medical education changes are national in scope. It has created disproportionately harmful effects on family practice residencies from Maine to Alaska. A recent survey of all family practice residency program directors has found that: 
56 percent of respondents who were in the process of developing new rural training sites have indicated that they will either not implement those plans or are unsure about their sponsoring institutions' continued support. 
21 percent of respondents report planning to decrease their family practice residency slots in the immediate future. The majority of those who are planning to decrease their slots are the sole residency program in a teaching hospital. This means that, under current law, they have no alternative way of achieving growth, such as through a reduction of other specialty slots in 
order to stay within the cap. 
And finally, the vast majority of family practice residencies did not have their full residency FTEs captured in the 1996 cost reports upon which the cap is based. 
In addition to this survey, we have anecdotal information from residencies across the country detailing how they have lost funding either because of where they trained their residents or because their residents had been extended sick or maternity leave. For example, one family practice residency in Washington State last year had an equivalent of 14 residents training outside of the hospital and four in the hospital. Under the BBA, their cap would be four. By contrast, had all of their residents been trained in the hospital up to this point, their payment base would have been capped at 18, even if they trained residents in non-hospital settings in the future. 
The Medicare Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act, which I am introducing today, will address these problems by basing the cap on the number of residents `who were appointed by the approved medical residency training programs for the hospital' in 1996, rather than on the number of residents who were `in the hospital.' 
I am also concerned that the Balanced Budget Act and its accompanying regulations will severely hamper primary care residency programs that are expanding to meet local needs. Specifically, a new residency program that had not met its full complement of accredited residency positions until after the cutoff date of August 5, 1997, is precluded from increasing its number of residents unless the hospital decreases the number of residents in one of its other specialty programs. However, over forty percent of the nation's family practice residency programs are the only program sponsored by the hospital. This provision therefore completely precludes such a hospital from expanding its residency program to meet emerging primary care needs. 
To address this problem, the legislation I am introducing today would exempt the small number of programs at hospitals that sponsor just one residency program from the cap. In addition, to enable a number of family practice residency programs that are already in the pipeline to get accredited and grow to completion, the bill extends the cutoff date to September 1999. 
And finally, the Balanced Budget Act gave the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to give `special consideration' to new facilities that `meet the needs of underserved rural areas.' The Health Care Financing Administration has interpreted this to mean facilities that are actually in underserved rural areas. There have been several recent expansions in family practice residency programs that include a rural training track, with residents located in outlying hospitals, or with satellite programs designed specifically to train residents to work with underserved populations. 
Even though these new programs or satellites required accrediting body approval, they are still part of the `mother' residencies, which may not be physically located in an underserved rural area. While these are not technically new programs, I believe that the definition should be expanded to include such endeavors, given the value of these programs in addressing the needs of underserved populations. Therefore, the Medicare Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act would expand the definition to include `facilities which are not located in an underserved rural area, but which have established separately accredited rural training tracks.'

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, since coming to the Senate and assuming the Chairmanship of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, one of my top priorities has been the seemingly never-ending fight to ferret out and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in federal government programs. We've all heard the horror stories of $500 hammers and roads built to nowhere. The waste of scarce federal resources not only picks the pockets of the taxpayers but also places severe financial pressures on already overburdened programs, forcing cutbacks in the delivery of vital government services. 
Over the past year, I have seen this waste first-hand as the Subcommittee put a spotlight on massive fraud in the Medicare program. To cite just one example, the Subcommittee's investigation revealed that the federal government had been sending Medicare checks to 14 health care companies whose address, if they had existed, was in the middle of the runway of the Miami International Airport. That fraud cost the taxpayers millions of dollars, diverting scarce resources from the elderly and legitimate health care providers. 
This example and others like it were uncovered by my Subcommittee working hand-in-hand with the Inspector General's Office, whose mission is to identify the eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs. In many ways, the Inspectors General are the eyes and ears of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, in particular, and the Congress, in general, as we strive to detect and prevent waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in federal programs. 
Mr. President, this year marks the 20th anniversary of the Inspector General Act, the law that the Congress passed to create these guardians of the public purse. As we recognize this anniversary, it is important for Congress to take a close look at the IG system. 
During the past 20 years, the Inspector General community has grown from 12 in 1978 to 57 Inspectors General today. These offices receive more than $1 billion in annual funding and employ over 10,000 auditors, criminal investigators, and support personnel. The Office of Inspector General is charged with tremendous responsibilities and is given considerable authority to uncover waste and abuse within the government. 
By and large, the IG community has done an outstanding job. They have made thousands of recommendations to Congress, ultimately saving taxpayers literally billions of dollars. Investigations by Inspectors General have also resulted in the recovery of billions of dollars from companies and individuals who defrauded the federal government. These investigations have been the basis for thousands of criminal prosecutions, debarments, exclusions and suspensions. 
The Inspectors General have a demonstrated record of success over the past 20 years, but as with any government program, we must be vigilant to ensure that the program is well managed, accountable, and effective. With this goal in mind and drawing on my work with the Inspectors General over the past year and a half, I am introducing the `Inspector General Act Amendments of 1998,' a bill to improve the accountability and efficiency of the Inspectors 
General program. I am pleased to have my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, as a cosponsor. 
The bill is designed to increase the accountability and independence of Inspectors General. It establishes a renewable nine-year term of office for each of the 26 Inspectors General who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. This provision will also encourage Inspectors General to serve for longer periods of time so that their experience and judgment can be used to fight waste, fraud and abuse. 
This bill also takes steps to streamline the IG Offices themselves--making them more efficient and flexible--by consolidating existing offices and by reducing the volume of the inspectors general reporting requirements. 
The number of OIGs has increased more than four-fold in twenty years, and many of these are small offices with just a handful of employees. These small OIGs can be made far more efficient and effective by transferring their functions to larger, department-wide IG offices. For example, my bill consolidates the current stand-alone office of the Peace Corps, with just 15 employees, into the State Department--eliminating unnecessary overhead and bureaucracy but continuing thorough audit and oversight of the Peace Corps. Under this proposal, seven existing small IG offices are consolidated into the IG offices of major departments. 
Currently, Offices of Inspectors General are required by law to provide semi-annual reports to Congress. My bill would increase the value of the report process by reducing the requirement to a single annual report and streamlining the information required for each report. For example, the new reporting requirement would require the IGs to identify areas within their jurisdiction which are at highest risk for waste, fraud and abuse. In that way, the Congress can attack those weak areas before they get worse and before the problems become more difficult to solve. 
The Inspectors General have made valuable contributions to the efficient operation of the federal government, but their record is not without blemish. For example, this successful record was recently tarnished by the activities of the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General. After an extensive investigation, my Subcommittee found that this office violated federal laws in 
the award of two sole-source contracts, which wasted thousands of dollars. It was disturbing to find that this one Inspector General's Office was itself guilty of wasting resources--the very office charged with preventing fraud and abuse. At the conclusion of that investigation, the Subcommittee asked the question: who is watching the watchdogs? 
Let me stress that, in my view, problems like the ones in the Treasury Inspector General's office are not widespread in the Inspector General community. However, an Inspector General is not like any other government manager. Inspectors General are the very officials in government responsible for combating waste, fraud and abuse in Federal programs. And as such, Inspectors General should be held to a higher standard. To do their job effectively, Inspectors General must be above reproach, must set an example for other government managers to follow, and must not create situations where there is even the appearance of impropriety. Credibility and effectiveness are lost when the office charged with combating waste and abuse engages in the kind of activity that the Inspector General is responsible for deterring. 
To increase accountability, my bill requires independent external reviews of the Inspector General offices every three years. It gives each office the flexibility to choose the most efficient method of review, but it does require that the watchdogs themselves submit to oversight by a qualified third party. This provision will help ensure public confidence in the management and efficiency of the IG offices. 
Finally, Mr. President, one provision that is not included in this bill, but that deserves careful consideration, is the grant of statutory law enforcement authority for the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Medicare fraud investigation conducted by my Subcommittee revealed the dangers faced by HHS-IG Special Agents when they work with the FBI and others to investigate some cases of health care fraud. These agents work side by side with other federal law enforcement professionals, and the Congress should carefully examine the best way to provide them with tools necessary for them to do their jobs effectively. 
Mr. President, the bill I introduce today represents the first step in the process to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and accountability of the Inspector General program. These offices provide valuable assistance to the Congress so that we can exercise our duty to oversee the operation of the federal government and to make sure that the taxpayer's money is well spent and not wasted. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to strengthen and improve the Inspectors General program into the next century.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, yesterday was the ninth anniversary of the massacre of hundreds of prodemocracy students on Tiananmen Square in Beijing by troops acting under the orders of the Communist Government of China. In memory of the brave students who suffered and died there for speaking out peacefully against political repression, and in memory of those who are imprisoned still, last night I attempted to introduce this resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that our Government should remain committed to honoring the memory of these victims of oppression and also that supporting China's peaceful transition to democracy should be a principal goal of our foreign policy. 
I know that such sentiments are shared by all Members of this body. After all, who could possibly object to honoring the Chinese student martyrs to democracy on the ninth anniversary of their massacre? After all, our most cherished political ideals are those of inalienable rights and democratic self-rule. Unfortunately, however, we were unable to get the resolution cleared last night on the Democratic side. This objection prevented the Senate from making any statement in memory of the victims of Tiananmen Square on the ninth anniversary of their murder. 
I am pleased, however, to report today that the cold light of morning has helped bring some perspective to this issue and that the objection to my resolution has now been withdrawn. I am very grateful for the cooperation of the Democratic leader in resolving the issue on his side. 
I spoke at some length last night about the purpose of this resolution, so I will not repeat those remarks now. Let me merely say that it is deeply gratifying to see all of us join together in expressing our heartfelt commitment to democracy and human rights in China and in honoring the memory of those slain in the pursuit of these ideals. It may be 24 hours late, Mr. President, but history will not find the U.S. Senate to have been voiceless in remembrance of the victims in the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 4, 1989. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in the short time that I will take to deliver these remarks, a woman will be diagnosed with breast cancer. And every 12 minutes, a woman will die from it. 
Just this past year, breast cancer has touched my life twice: one member of staff, aged 37, and the spouse of another member of my staff both developed breast cancer. Watching these women in their daily struggles has been a heart-wrenching experience as well as a call to action. 
I know that several of my colleagues' lives have also been personally touched by breast cancer. The senior Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe, lost her mother to breast cancer at a tragically young age. Throughout her career in Congress, Senator Snowe has been a tireless advocate for breast cancer awareness and increased funding for research. Her leadership on this issue has been invaluable--even lifesaving--for countless women across the country. 
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women in the United States. However, when breast cancer is detected early and treated promptly, suffering and the loss of life can be significantly reduced. 
Approximately one out of every eight women will develop breast cancer during her lifetime. In 1998 alone, an estimated 180,200 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Even more disturbing, breast cancer is the leading cause of death among women aged 35 to 54. 
Washingtonians will have the opportunity to call attention to breast cancer and raise much-needed research dollars when the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation hosts its 9th annual National Race for the Cure on Saturday, June 6. 
Those of us who work on Capitol Hill have an added opportunity to contribute to the cure for breast cancer thanks to a challenge grant from Eli Lilly and Company. The third annual Lilly Capitol Hill Challenge will match the registration fees for all members of Congress, their spouses, and staff who participate in the National Race for the Cure. Since 1996, Lilly and Capitol Hill have raised $200,000 for breast cancer prevention, research, and treatment--75% of which stays in the DC metropolitan area. 
Two weeks ago, all the women in the Senate joined me in circulating a `Dear Colleague' letter encouraging Members of Congress and staff to take advantage of Lilly's generous offer and register for this year's race. And I would like to let my colleagues know that it is not too late to participate. Late registrations are being accepted up until Friday evening at 6:30 in the lobby of the Department of Commerce. 
Today, I rise to the floor to once again encourage my colleagues to alert members of their staff, their families and friends to this valuable opportunity to support the Komen Foundation and Race for the Cure on June 6th. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am really surprised and shocked that apparently there is objection on the Democratic side of the aisle to consideration of this important resolution. I had hoped that we would consider this evening a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate upon the ninth anniversary of the tragic massacre of Chinese students in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. 
My resolution, had I been permitted to proceed with it this evening, was cosponsored by the distinguished majority leader, by the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, and by the Senator from Michigan, Senator Abraham. Regrettably, my colleagues from the Democratic side of the aisle have blocked consideration of this resolution. I would, however, like to take a moment to explain why I consider it to be very important. 
Mr. President, 9 years ago, thousands of students were peaceably assembled on Tiananmen Square in Beijing, peacefully protesting their government's refusal to permit them even the most basic freedoms of expression, association, and political activity. 
As a symbol of their hopes and aspirations for a democratic China, these students constructed a scale model of our own Statue of Liberty. It was to them, as it is to us and to untold millions around the world, a symbol of freedom's promise for people everywhere. Quoting Thomas Jefferson, these brave Chinese students spoke eloquently of the need for China to develop democratic institutions, and finally to allow a degree of political progress to match its dramatic economic change and development in recent years. 
Nine years ago today--today--the excitement and the promise of this Chinese democracy movement were extinguished as troops and armored vehicles were ordered into action against the peaceful students. Mr. President, it may never be known exactly how many died in the resulting bloodbath, but hundreds of Chinese demonstrators were certainly killed and many thousands more were arrested for so-called counterrevolutionary offenses that consisted only of attempting to assert rights that it is the duty of civilized governments everywhere to observe, protect and promote. 
I am wearing, Mr. President, a ribbon to commemorate just one of those political prisoners from that very sad period. 
I had hoped to introduce and have the Senate pass this resolution to make very clear to everyone in this country and, indeed, around the globe that the U.S. Senate has not forgotten what occurred in Tiananmen Square 9 years ago today. 
Mr. President, my resolution sought to do no more than to make clear that what occurred on June 4, 1989, was profoundly wrong and that we should not permit ourselves or our Government ever to forget this. This resolution would have merely expressed the sense of the Senate that our Government should remain committed to honoring the memory and the spirit of the Chinese citizens who died on Tiananmen Square and that assisting China's peaceful transition to democracy should be a principal goal of our foreign policy. 
Mr. President, it is important that we remember Tiananmen Square today precisely because we do enjoy increasingly close ties with the regime in Beijing. Relations with the People's Republic of China are--and must--be a continual balancing act. The memory of Tiananmen Square should help us find the appropriate bounds, preventing us from giving way to a wholly unchecked enthusiasm in U.S.-Chinese relations by disregarding the fundamental nature of the regime with which we are dealing. China is not a democracy, after all, and its government still has few qualms about using armed force to suppress the legitimate aspirations of its people for basic liberties. 
I do not expect democracy to flower overnight in China. But it is today quite clear that China is capable of democracy. The very strength of the student movement that Communist authorities tried to crush on Tiananmen Square nine years ago attests to the powerful appeal that democracy and human rights have in China. The successes of pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong's recent elections also attest to how strong democratic ideals can be in China when not suppressed by autocrats intent upon preserving their own power and privileges. Most of all, the new and thriving democracy on Taiwan stands as the clearest indication that the phrase `Chinese democracy' is not an oxymoron. In fact, the phrase `Chinese democracy is a ray of hope for a quarter of our planet's population. 
This is why it is important always to keep Tiananmen Square in our minds as we pursue our `engagement' with China. While we cannot ignore China and its huge population, neither can we ignore the human rights abuses committed by its government. Sound public policymaking is about pragmatism, but it is about the pragmatic pursuit of principles. Without principle, pragmatism is no more than a fraud, a process that lacks a purpose; there is no substitute for an underlying moral compass. This is why I very much wanted to introduce my resolution today: in U.S.-China relations, the memory of Tiananmen Square is one of the cardinal points on our moral compass, without which we cannot navigate.

 Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, there is no conduct less consistent with the precepts of a civilized society than the physical abuse of those unable to defend themselves. Our recognition of this has led to an aggressive and ongoing campaign against child abuse, and it must lead to an equally strong response to domestic violence directed at older Americans. For that reason, I am honored to rise today to cosponsor the Older Women's Protection from Violence Act, legislation introduced by my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and I commend Senator Durbin for his leadership in this area. 
Mr. President, at a 1995 hearing in Portland, Maine, chaired by my predecessor, Senator Cohen, elder abuse was aptly described as `society's secret shame.' Family violence, particularly when directed at the elderly, was a major concern of Senator Cohen, and I welcome the opportunity to continue his efforts to combat this intolerable mistreatment of older Americans. 
Mr. President, earlier this month my home state released its crime statistics for 1997. I was cheered by the wonderful news that crime fell by 8.7% from 1996, to the lowest rate in at least 20 years. Hidden behind this positive statistic, however, was one that was very disquieting, namely, that domestic violence increased by 7.8%. Ironically, at the same time as we are becoming less likely to be harmed by strangers, many of our neighbors face an increasing threat from members of their own households. 
National data demonstrate that cases of domestic elder abuse, which includes neglect as well as physical abuse, are steadily increasing. From 1986 to 1996, the number of cases went from 117,000 to 293,000, an increase of 150%. Furthermore, there is widespread agreement that this type of abuse is greatly underreported. For example, although the number of reported cases in 1994 was 241,000, the National Center on Elder Abuse estimates that the true number of cases was 818,000. 
Mr. President, while these numbers indicate a serious and growing problem, all of the statistics in the world do not describe the problem as eloquently as the words of a single victim. At the Maine hearing, one such victim told what happened to her at the hands of her husband after her children left home. 
[T]hings got really bad. I had two broken wrists, cracked ribs, held down with his knee on my chest with a knife at my throat. I was made to crawl across the floor with a gun resting on my head, ready to fire. I've been choked until I was limp, and then he would drop me on the floor with a kick. I've been spit on, thrown through a window, dragged into the lake as he said he was going to drown me. 
Astonishingly, but not atypically, the witness was married to her husband for 44 years. 
Compounding the physical abuse suffered by elderly victims of violence is the sense of being trapped. Again, one of the witnesses at the Portland hearing described this far more effectively than I can. 
People ask why I remained under such circumstances. It was fear that kept me there. . . . I had been on an island for eight years. Where would I go? I had no money, no home, no job, and no credit. Although I had left good jobs to follow him from job to job, at age 60 who would hire me? Health insurance was my greatest concern. 
With a dependence on the abuser for financial support and physical care, with a long history of emotional ties to that person, with the fear of being held up to ridicule, and with a sense of hopelessness about finding a way out of the predicament, it is hardly surprising that the elderly victim is often reluctant to report domestic assaults. 
Domestic violence against older women is a complex problem about which we still lack adequate information. This has led to some erroneous 
assumptions. For example, it had been thought that assaults against the elderly usually result from caregiver stress, but while this is a factor, its effect now appears to have been overstated. Indeed, according to a recent report, `[a]busers are not identical in their behavior or their assumptions about abusive conduct.' As the report points out, this means that a `cookie cutter' approach will not solve the problem. 
Furhter complicating our efforts to deal with domestic violence against older women are the conflicting feelings and desires of many of the victims. It is quite common for the victim to have a familial relationship with the abuser, and thus, far more is likely to be involved in dealing with these situations that in dealing with an assault committed by a stranger. For understandable reasons, the older woman may want to preserve the relationship while ending the abuse. Finding effective ways to accomplish this can be a formidable challenge. 
Mr. President, the legislation that Senator Durbin and I are introducing today recognizes that complex problems defy simple solutions. Thus, the Older Women's Protection from Violence Act does not purport to contain a magic bullet that will eliminate this reprehensible conduct, but rather looks to a multi-faceted approach to address a multi-faceted problem. Similarly, the bill does not offer revolutionary solutions; instead, its message is that the time has come for society to roll up its sleeves and engage in the hard work of protecting those who have contributed so much to our individual and collective well-being. 
In keeping with the nature of the problem, the legislation provides for training those who are in a position to identify cases of domestic violence against older women. Consistent with the notion that we cannot stop or correct what we do not discover, the primary recipients of that training would be law enforcement officers and health professionals. In addition, the Attorney General is authorized to make grants to law school clinical programs to include elder abuse cases. 
The bill reauthorizes and expands programs that provide services to battered older women. Such services include outreach, support, and counseling. It also enhances their access to domestic violence shelters, something that can mean the difference between life and death in some cases. I should emphasize that the provision of these services will be largely at the local level, with financial assistance from the federal government. 
Mr. President, in a prior position, I managed a state agency that has as one of its principal mandates that protection of Maine people, many of them elderly, from fraud and other financial abuses. Thus, I am especially pleased that in addition to addressing violence against older women, this bill seeks to shed light on a problem affecting the elderly that has received even less attention, namely, their financial exploitation by a caregiver or family member. 
Two cases discussed at the Maine hearing illustrate my point. In one, an elderly gentleman from southern Maine went without food because his two nephews were stealing his money. Yet, he refused to send them away because they were `family.' In the second case, a 75-year old eastern Maine woman returned from the hospital after a severe stroke to find that her daughter and son-in-law had changed the locks on her house. The physical and emotional impact of the experience was so great that she was unable to undertake the legal battle to reclaim her home. 
This bill will shed light on this type of abuse by requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a study of the nature and extent of financial exploitation of older individuals. Our society simply cannot allow our senior citizens who have labored hard to build up a nest egg to have it wrongfully taken from them a the time they need it most. 
Mr. President, interest in elder abuse did not begin in our country until the late 1980s, long after we began to focus on child abuse in the 1960s. This may be because these cases are among the least likely to be reported. It may also be because our culture tends to worship youth, perhaps giving our older citizens the sense that we care less about them. In any case, this must change, not only because of demographic trends, but also because it is right. 
This bill will contribute to that change by dealing specifically with domestic violence against older women. In addition to providing services to the victims of this conduct, it funds research into various aspects of the problem to enhance our understanding and improve our ability to respond. Our secret shame must not remain a secret. 
Mr. President, in 1996 the average age of elder abuse victims was 78. There can be no justification for letting these older Americans, who have reached the point in life where they deserve peace, comfort, and respect, to be the victims of domestic violence or any other form of abuse. This bill is designed to prevent that, and I trust that my colleagues will support us in the effort.

<TEXT>
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this week the Senate is debating far-reaching landmark legislation which gives us a historic opportunity to combat teen smoking and in the process save millions of lives. 
Tobacco use is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in the United States, accounting for almost half a million deaths a year and billions of dollars in health care costs. More people die each year in the United States from smoking than from AIDS, suicide, alcohol and drug abuse, car accidents, and fires combined. Tobacco use in this country carries a price tag of almost $100 billion a year in direct health costs and in lost productivity. 
Clearly, the single most effective thing we can do to improve our Nation's health is to stop smoking. However, smoking rates are actually increasing, particularly, and most tragically, among our young people. Tragically, tobacco addiction is increasingly a teen onset disease. Ninety percent of all smokers start before age 21. What is especially disturbing is that children, especially girls, are smoking at younger and younger ages. Smoking is at a 19-year high among high school seniors and has increased by over 35 percent among 8th graders over the past 7 years. 
The statistics for my own State of Maine are particularly alarming. Maine has the dubious distinction of having the highest smoking rate among young adults in the country. Thirty-two percent of our 18- to 30-year-olds are regular smokers. Almost 40 percent of Maine's high school seniors smoke. If current trends continue, one in nine children will die prematurely of tobacco-related illnesses. 
Tobacco is the leading preventable cause of death in Maine, responsible for almost 2,500 deaths a year. Direct medical costs of treating tobacco-related illnesses in Maine are about $200 million. Indirect costs--the costs associated with lost work time, higher insurance premiums and so forth--are also estimated to be about $200 million. 
These numbers speak for themselves. The status quo is simply unacceptable. If we are to put an end to this tragic and preventable epidemic, we must accelerate our efforts not only to help more smokers quit but also to discourage young people from ever lighting up in the first place. 
I found one fact in a recent Maine survey of smoking habits to be particularly disturbing. The smoking rate among young girls in my State has increased by 30 percent since 1993. I think that this advertisement gives us a good clue why. It is a blatant and shameless attempt by the tobacco industry to entice young girls, to entice teenagers to smoke. With more than 1,000 of the tobacco industries' best customers dying every day and another 3,000 to 5,000 quitting because of health concerns, smokers are literally a dying breed. As a consequence, the tobacco industry must hook thousands of new customers each day just to break even, and is now spending over $5 billion a year on advertising and promotional campaigns. 
The tobacco industry actually claims that it does not target image-conscious young people with its advertisements featuring rugged Marlboro men and fresh-faced, model thin, `You can do it' young women. But, Mr. President, the evidence clearly proves otherwise. Just look again at this magazine ad. It is very typical, very typical of cigarette advertising. This ad is not aimed at people my age. It certainly is not aimed at people my parent's age. There can be no doubt it is not aimed at adults at all. It is aimed at teenagers. 
Moreover, internal industry documents indicate that tobacco companies have long known that tobacco use leads to addiction, serious illness, and death. Yet, they nevertheless continue to pursue children, to target teens through ads and promotional campaigns, and have even gone so far as to consider marketing Coca-Cola-flavored cigarettes. 
A landmark 1991 study published in the Journal of American Medical Association showed that cigarette-smoking `Smooth Joe' Camel was as recognizable to 6-year-olds as Mickey Mouse. Let me repeat that. Joe Camel was as recognizable to 6-year-olds as Mickey Mouse. The tobacco industry claimed the ads were, in fact, directed at adults. A second study found that 98 percent of the 12- to 19-year-olds recognized Joe Camel, compared to just 72 percent of adults. As a result, Camel's market share among underage consumers rose from less than 1 percent when the Joe Camel campaign first began, to 33 percent when he was finally put out to pasture. 
More recent studies published in JAMA and elsewhere add further weight to the mounting evidence that advertising and marketing are the linchpins of the tobacco industry's efforts to hook children on nicotine. A February 1998 JAMA study found that the effect of tobacco advertising and promotional activities is `strong and specific,' with at least 34 percent of all experimentation with cigarettes by teenagers attributable to those activities. 
Moreover, a 1995 article in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that tobacco marketing has a greater influence over a teen's decision to smoke than whether or not their parents smoke or their peers smoke. 
Other studies have shown that the cigarette brands most popular with teenagers are the ones most likely to advertise in magazines with the highest youth readership. Moreover, unlike adults, the vast majority of young smokers prefer the most heavily advertised brands of cigarettes. 
It is also far too easy for children and teens in the United States to purchase cigarettes. During hearings in the Labor Committee, we heard testimony that children living in 99 percent of our cities and towns have very little trouble walking into a store and buying a pack of cigarettes, despite the fact that it is against the law in all 50 States to sell tobacco products to minors. 
Mr. President, during this debate, we have focused a great deal of attention on the $1.10-a-pack fee that the McCain bill imposes on cigarettes. Some have argued today that is simply too low and that an increase to $1.50 or more a pack is necessary if we are going to curb underage smoking. Others--and I include myself in this group--are concerned that the evidence linking teen usage and price is not conclusive. Moreover, I am very concerned that a price increase of this magnitude is highly regressive and will fall mainly on adult smokers earning less than $30,000 a year. If we were to increase the cost by the $1.50 that was proposed, it would have meant that the average couple who smoke would be paying $712 more a year in taxes. That is a very hefty tax increase on low-income Americans. 
Mr. President, at some point, raising the tax on cigarettes ceases to contribute to the reduction of smoking and becomes little more than an act of financial cruelty. Tobacco is highly addictive and there are people, perhaps many people, who will not be able to quit smoking even with an additional tax of $1.50 or more. 
There is a point at which the tendency of the U.S. Senate to play God in the lives of the American people becomes dangerous. The notion that we can cure addictions by creating enough deprivation for those who are addicted is a very arrogant one. If we are wrong, we do nothing more than inflict suffering on those who do not deserve it. 
While I respect the motives of its supporters, I could not, and did not, back an amendment that carries such a risk and that is not truly needed to fund the antismoking programs included in this bill. Those of us who legislate must draw lines, and recognizing that I am far from infallible, I believe that a tax of $1.50 per pack crosses that line. If our purpose is to inflict pain, it should be on those who profit from the addiction and not on those who suffer from it. That is why I shall vote to support the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from New Hampshire to eliminate the immunity protections afforded to the tobacco industry by this bill. 
My view on the $1.50-a-pack tax proposal has been strongly reinforced by conversations I have had in recent weeks with young people in my State in an attempt to find out what the true experts--our teenagers--believe would be most effective in stopping teens from smoking in the first place. I have asked this question to, among others, a seventh grader from Portland, a Boy Scout troop in Dover-Foxcroft, high school students in Aroostook, and a teen smoker in Bangor. Significantly, none of these teens felt that a price increase would be the most effective means of discouraging teens from smoking. 
As the addicted Bangor teen told me, `I can't quit, so what 
 I'll do is cut back on going to the movies or going to McDonald's in order to pay for cigarettes.' 
Another teen told me that many students get their cigarettes by stealing them from their parents, so unless their parents stopped smoking, their access to cigarettes will be unaffected. 
Alex Pringle, a seventh grader from Portland, suggested that having smokers who are suffering from lung cancer or other smoking-related diseases come to schools would be the most effective means of discouraging kids from smoking. It would effectively make the link between smoking and illness, a link that is too often unrecognizable to teens who believe themselves to be invulnerable. 
Teens throughout the State told me that they smoked simply because it was `cool' or because it helped them feel more accepted by their friends. From their comments, I have no doubt that the tobacco industry's ads, such as the one I have displayed today, have sent a clear message to teens that teens who smoke are cool. I also have no doubt that when teens see movie idols such as Leonardo DeCaprio smoke, that message is, unfortunately, reinforced. 
That is why the educational, counteradvertising, and research programs funded by this legislation, as well as the advertising restrictions, are so critical to our efforts to sever the deadly connection between teens and tobacco. 
Earlier this year, I joined Senators Jim Jeffords and Mike Enzi in introducing the Preventing Addiction to Smoking Among Teens, or the PAST Act, which adopts a comprehensive approach to preventing teens from smoking. The bill gave clear and comprehensive authority to the FDA to regulate tobacco products and incorporated the FDA's recommendations on combating teen smoking, such as strong warning labels, a ban on vending machine sales, a ban on outdoor advertising and brand name sponsorship of sporting events, and prohibition on the use of images like Joe Camel and the Marlboro man. The legislation also held tobacco companies accountable by imposing stiff financial penalties if the smoking rate among children does not decline. 
Moreover, the legislation incorporates strong measures to ensure that restrictions on youth access to tobacco products are tough and enforceable, and it promoted the development of State and local community action programs designed not only to educate the public on the hazards of tobacco and addiction, but also to promote the prevention and cessation of the use of tobacco products. We need to focus on cessation programs. They are an important part of this bill. 
It also called for a comprehensive, tobacco-related research program to study the nature of addiction, the effects of nicotine on the body, and ways to change behavior, particularly that of children and teens. We don't know enough about addiction yet. 
And finally, and very important, it called for a national public education campaign to deglamorize the use of tobacco products to discourage teens from smoking. 
Mr. President, we have made tremendous progress in recent years in making our streets safer from alcohol-impaired drivers. This was accomplished not only through tough drunk-driving laws, but also through a very effective national advertising campaign waged by Mothers Against Drunk Driving and others that has resulted in a change in our Nation's attitudes toward drinking and driving. This is the approach that we need to take to curb teen smoking. 
The legislation we are considering this week contains many of the public health provisions that were included in the PAST Act. While the legislation before us tonight is not perfect and will undoubtedly face many more amendments during Senate consideration, it does give us a critical opportunity to address the teen smoking epidemic in a strong and comprehensive way. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to preserve the state statute of limitations for cases removed to Federal court under this legislation. 
I intend to vote for this bill. But in doing so, I think it important to be straightforward about what S. 1260 does. This is a bill that preempts state law. Specifically, it preempts securities antifraud statutes for certain types of class action cases. 
I generally oppose preemption, as I think it overlooks the considerable wisdom that exists at the local level. Not without some measure of discomfort, I am nonetheless inclined to vote for this bill, because I find considerable merit to the contention that large class-action cases against companies whose securities are sold in the national marketplace may well belong in the Federal courts. Otherwise, Congress' ability to regulate our national securities markets in an era of international investing is arguably impeded. 
I feel strongly, however, that if we are going to preempt state law and impose a single federal standard, it must be a fair one, and that is not the case with the federal statute of limitations. Under federal law, a securities fraud suit must be brought within one year of when the fraud was or should have been discovered, but in no instance after more than three years have elapsed. 
I served for five years as the head of the Maine department that regulates financial institutions, and I can tell you from personal experience that a three-year limitations period is too short. The reality is that, even with due diligence, some frauds are not discovered within that time frame. Indeed, the very object of a fraud is to deceive the other party to the transaction for as long as possible. 
The limited partnership cases of the last decade illustrate my point. The victims of those frauds were largely elderly, largely trusting, and largely lacking in financial sophistication. It is no wonder that in many of those instances, they did not, and even within reasonable care, could not have, discovered the fraud within three years of its commission. 
It is not just my opinion that the Federal limitations period is inadequate. The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken the position that the period is too short. 
This is an instance in which the Maine Legislature has shown more wisdom than the Federal Government. Under the law of my state, the limitation period is two years from the date the fraud was, or with reasonable care, should have been discovered, with no outside limit. That gives innocent investors the opportunity to obtain redress for fraud as long as they act with reasonable diligence. 
I can understand the argument for a single, Federal standard in this area, but I cannot accept preempting a state standard that is far more consistent with reality. While the best remedy would be to change the Federal limitations period for all securities fraud cases, that issue is not before us today. Thus, we should take the next best step, which is to preserve the state statutes for cases that are removed to Federal court under this legislation. 
What this amendment will not do is harm high-tech companies. What it will do--maybe not this year or next, but at some point--is to protect innocent, unsuspecting investors, who are victimized by a securities scam that could not reasonably have been discovered within three years. Thus, I urge my colleagues not to wait until we have such victims, but to stop the problem before it occurs by supporting this amendment. 
I thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to start by complimenting the chairman of the Commerce Committee for his outstanding leadership in dealing with a very important consumer issue, and that is telephone slamming. 
I also want to commend the Senator from North Dakota for his very eloquent explanation of the problem and the solutions. 
Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for S. 1618, legislation that will provide America's consumers with much needed protection against a fraudulent practice known as slamming--the unauthorized switching of a customer's telephone service provider. I want to commend Senator McCain and Hollings for taking steps to attack this rapidly growing problem. 
Telephone slamming is spreading like wildfire. In Maine, complaints increased by 100 percent from 1996 to 1997. Nationwide, slamming is the number one telephone-related complaint. While the FCC received more than 20,000 slamming complaints in 1997, a significant increase over the previous year, estimates from phone companies indicate that as many as one million people were slammed during that 12-month period. 
Last fall, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, undertook an extensive investigation of this problem. At a field hearing this past February in Portland, Maine, at which I was joined by Senator Durbin, one of the leaders in the fight against slamming, we heard from several consumers who were victimized by this practice. Their words reflect the public attitude toward the intentional slammer, as they described what happened to them as `stealing,' `criminal,' and `break-in.' 
My Subcommittee recently held a second hearing, which revealed that a number of what are known as switchless resellers were responsible for a large percentage of the intentional slamming incidents. These operations use deceptive marketing practices and outright fraud to switch consumers' long distance service without their consent. 
One recent victim was a hospital in western Maine. This demonstrates that no one is immune from this despicable practice. 
Mr. President, our hearings presented a case that dramatically shows the need for tougher sanctions to deal with this problem. I refer to an individual by the name of Daniel Fletcher, who fraudulently operated as a long distance reseller under at least eight different company names, slamming thousands of consumers, and billing them for at least $20 million in long distance charges. While we were struck by the ease with which Mr. Fletcher 
carried out his activities and evaded detection, we were shocked to learn about the absence of adequate criminal sanctions to deal with his activities. 
Mr. Fletcher bilked America's telephone customers out of millions of dollars by charging them for services they did not authorize and obtaining from them money to which he was not entitled. Yet, we lack a statute that expressly makes intentional slamming a crime, and unless that is corrected, we can expect many more Fletchers. Mr. President, the time has come for the United States Congress to disconnect the telephone slammers. 
Given our concern about this problem, Senator Durbin and I introduced slamming legislation, and I want to thank Senators McCain and Hollings for agreeing to incorporate its three main provisions into a Manager's Amendment to their bill. These additions will help make a good bill even better. 
The first of these provisions will get tough with the outright scam artists by establishing new criminal penalties for intentional slamming. I should emphasize that these penalties will apply only to those who know that they are acting without the customer's authorization and not to those who make an honest mistake or even act carelessly. It's time we sent the deliberate slammer to the slammer. In addition, anyone convicted of intentional slamming will be disqualified from being a telecommunications service provider, thereby enabling us not only to punish past conduct but also to prevent future violations. 
The second provision is designed to remove the financial incentive for companies to engage in slamming by giving slammed customers the option to pay their original carrier at their previous rate. Under current law, it appears that customers are obligated to pay the slammer even after they discover they have been switched without their consent. That hardly acts as a deterrent, something that must be changed. 
The third provision will improve enforcement by requiring all telecommunications carriers to report slamming violations on a quarterly basis to the FCC. To avoid putting a burden on the carriers, the report need only be summary in nature, but it will enable the FCC to identify and move against the frequent slammer. 
Deregulation of the telephone industry may produce many benefits for consumers but it also has given rise to fraud where it did not previously exist. It was Congress who decided to deregulate the industry, and it is Congress that must act to stop this fraud. Senate bill 1618 will move us in that direction by putting a big dent in telephone slamming and by protecting the right of the American people to choose with whom they wish to do business. 
Again, I very much appreciate the cooperation of the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee and his willingness to accept the Collins-Durbin amendments. 
I thank the Senator, and I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senator DeWine and I are offering an amendment to reduce some of the burdensome reporting requirements placed on educational institutions by the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning Tax Credits. 
These education tax incentives, which Congress created last year, are of great benefit to students and their families. Unfortunately, our attempt to expand educational opportunities has had the unintended effect of imposing a burdensome and costly reporting requirement on our post-secondary schools. 
Beginning with tax year 1998, every college, university, and proprietary school will have to provide the IRS with an array of information that will do little, if anything, to assist in tax collection. Not only will these schools have to report Social Security numbers and the amount of qualified tuition and aid for each student, the schools will also have to report to the IRS on the students' attendance status and program level. 
But that is not all, and the reporting requirements do not stop there, Mr. President. The schools will also be required to report either a taxpayer ID number or Social Security number for the person who will claim the tax credit--generally a parent or a guardian--for all students who do not claim the tax credit themselves. 
This administrative nightmare translates into real money. 
The American Council on Education has estimated that this reporting requirement will cost our colleges and universities $115 million in 1998 and $136 million in 1999.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we should not delude ourselves about who will end up paying the cost and price of these requirements. Ultimately, the cost of compliance will be shifted from the schools to the students and their families. As a result, the value of the Hope Scholarship Program and Lifetime Learning Tax Credit will be diminished. 
Mr. President, the IRS has complained that eliminating these reporting requirements will be too expensive, essentially arguing that too many people who are not entitled to claim the exemption will do so. I find this logic curious because with the other exemptions and credits in the code, we require the taxpayers to report the necessary information on their tax returns and maintain records of their expenses to support any tax credit or deduction that they claim. It seems to me that the education tax credits should receive the same treatment. 
But let's assume that the IRS is correct, Mr. President, and that the education tax credits should be treated differently--if that is the case, why should the burden fall on our nation's colleges and universities? 
The fact is that the IRS already collects much of the information needed to verify the validity of the tax credits. 
Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman of the committee and the distinguished ranking minority member to join with Senator DeWine and me in a request to the Joint Committee on Taxation to study this issue and to look specifically at what the cost would be to the IRS to develop a system to ensure compliance based on information that already requires taxpayers to file. For example, taxpayers are already required to file the name and the Social Security for their dependents. Many experts maintain that the IRS already has much of the information that it needs. It simply needs to modify its software to allow it to conduct matches to verify the information. 
Mr. President, it certainly is worth determining whether the cost to the IRS would be less than or more than the $115 million that it will cost our universities and colleges each year to comply with the paperwork associated with these credits. 
Mr. President, the rationale for the Hope and Lifetime Learning credits was to make postsecondary education more affordable, and thus more accessible to lower- and middle-income families. Unfortunately, what Congress has given with one hand it has taken away at least in part with its regulatory hand. It is within our power to fix this problem. We should do so soon. 
Tonight, pending the resolution of the larger issue, we can take one small step to alleviate some of the burden imposed upon our colleges and universities. The amendment that Senator DeWine and I are offering will change the requirement for reporting the tuition and grant aid pertaining to each student in a manner that will make it somewhat easier for our postsecondary institutions to comply. The Joint Committee on Taxation has scored the cost impact of the change as being negligible, but the revision will help our colleges and universities. 
I urge adoption of the amendment. I hope to have the cooperation of the chairman and ranking minority member in addressing the larger issue. 
Now I would like to yield to my colleague from Ohio and my cosponsor, Senator DeWine. 
Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on May 2-4, 1998, more than 1,200 students from across the nation were in Washington, D.C. to compete in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program. I am proud to announce that a class from Old Orchard Beach High School represented the State of Maine. These outstanding young scholars worked diligently to reach the national finals by winning local competitions in Maine. 
The distinguished members of the class representing Maine are: Lauren Asperschlager, Lucy Coulthard, Chad Daley, Rose Gordon, Krista Knowles, Nathan LaChance, Sarah Lunn, Sandra Marshall, Katie McPherson, Cindy St. Onge, Sam Tarbox, and Sharon Wilson. I also want to recognize their teacher, Michael Angelosante, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the class. The district coordinator, John Drisko, and the state coordinator, Pam Beal, also contributed a significant amount of time and effort to help the class reach the national finals. 
The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition simulates a congressional hearing whereby the students are given the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary constitutional issues. The simulated congressional hearing consists of oral presentations by the students before panels of adult judges. 
Administered by the Center for Civic Education, The We the People . . . program has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels for more than 75,000 teachers and 24 million students nationwide. Members of Congress and their staffs enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers. 
The We the People . . . program is designed to help students achieve a reasoned commitment to the fundamental values and principles that bind Americans together as a people. The program also fosters civic involvement as well as character traits conducive to effective and responsible participation in politics and government. 
I commend these student constitutional experts from Maine and throughout the nation who have participated in the We the People . . . national finals for their achievement in reaching this level of the competition.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have enabled a growing number of our most frail and vulnerable senior citizens to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they want to be--in their own homes. Today, home health is the fastest growing component of Medicare spending, and the program grew at an astounding average annual rate of more than 25 percent from 1990 to 1997. As a consequence, the number of Medicare home health beneficiaries has more than doubled, and Medicare home health spending has soared from $2.7 billion in 1989 to $17.1 billion in 1996. 
This rapid growth in home health spending understandably prompted Congress and the Health Care Financing Administration, as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, to initiate changes that were intended to make the program more cost-effective and efficient and protect it from fraud and abuse. However, in trying to get a handle on costs, we in Congress and the administration have unintentionally created problems that may restrict some elderly citizens' access to vitally needed home health care. 
Critics have long pointed out that Medicare's cost-based payment method for home health care has inherent incentives for home care agencies to provide more services, which has driven up costs. Therefore, the Balanced Budget Act called for the implementation of a prospective payment system for home care by October 1, 1999. Until then, home health agencies will be paid according to what is known as an Interim Payment System. 
Under the new IPS, home health agencies will be paid the lesser of: their actual costs; a per-visit cost limit; or a new blended agency-specific per beneficiary annual limit based 75 percent on an agency's own costs per beneficiary and 25 percent on the average cost per beneficiary for agencies in the same region. These costs are to be calculated from cost reports for reporting periods ending in 1994. 
I spent some time going over the formula because it is important to understand what the importance of that very complicated formula is for many of our home health agencies. 
At a recent hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, on which I serve, we heard testimony from a number of witnesses who expressed concern that the new Interim Payment System inadvertently penalizes cost-efficient home health agencies by basing 75 percent of the agencies' per patient payment limits on their FY 1994 average cost per patient. This system effectively rewards agencies that provided the most visits and spent the most Medicare dollars in 1994, while it penalizes low-cost, more efficient providers. Let me repeat that point, Mr. President. The agencies, usually the non-profits, that have provided services at the lowest cost, are penalized by the new payment system. 
Home health agencies in the Northeast are among those that have been particularly hard-hit by the formula change. As the Wall Street Journal recently observed,  
If New England had been just a little greedier, its home-health industry would be a lot better off now . . . Ironically, . . . [the region] is getting clobbered by the system because of its tradition of non-profit community service and efficiency.

<TEXT>
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this system also gives a competitive advantage to high-cost agencies over their lower cost neighbors, since agencies in a particular region may have dramatically different reimbursement levels regardless of any differences among their patient populations. And finally, this system may force low-cost agencies to stop accepting patients with more serious health care needs. 
That is exactly the opposite of what we should want. I simply do not think that this is what Congress intended. To rectify this problem, today I am pleased to introduce legislation along with Senators Chafee, Jeffords, Leahy, Feingold, Snowe, Durbin, Harkin, Reed and Santorum. The Medicare Home Health Equity Act will level the playing field and make certain that home health agencies that have been prudent in their use of Medicare resources are not unfairly penalized. The legislation will also ensure that home health agencies in the same region are reimbursed similarly for treating similar patients. 
Instead of allowing the experience of high-cost agencies to serve as the basis for the new cost limits, the bill we are introducing today sets a new per beneficiary cost limit based on a blend of national and regional average costs per patient. This new formula will be based 75 percent on the national average cost per patient and 25 percent on the regional average cost per patient. Moreover, by eliminating the agency-specific data from the formula, the Medicare Home Health Equity Act will move us more quickly to the national and regional rates which will be the cornerstones of the future prospective payment system, and it will do so in a way that is budget neutral.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the matter of NATO expansion is perhaps the single most important foreign policy or defense issue to come before Congress this year. Because of the complexity of the issues involved, the importance of this decision, and its implications for our relationship with Russia, I have not rushed to judgment on this subject. Today, however, I would like to explain why after careful consideration, I have decided to support NATO expansion. 
The past half-century has shown the cardinal importance of American engagement in European affairs. Throughout the Cold War, our involvement in Europe, principally through NATO, helped provide a crucial framework of peace and stability in which the countries of Europe have been able to develop--giving them breathing room in which to leave behind wartime devastation and grow into prosperous trading partners and allies. Today, of course, the Cold War has ended. The importance of U.S. involvement in Europe, however, has not. 
With the end of the continent's artificial division along the inter-German frontier into hostile ideological blocks, the meaning of `Europe' has changed and its role in the world has evolved. If they are to have relevance in this new post-Cold War era, institutions built around Europe's previous divisions must also evolve, or else face creeping irrelevance. NATO may not be important to the world in precisely the way it used to be--as a breakwater against Soviet expansionism--but the cooperative security arrangements it embodies remain vital to European stability and to world peace. 
Mr. President, NATO stands without peer in modern times as an institution capable of effective, coordinated international action in times of crisis. More important still, however, is the Alliance's much more quiet, everyday role as the ultimate underwriter of European peace, providing a supportive framework within which allied democracies can successfully consolidate themselves after difficult periods of transition and become valuable friends and partners in the best sense of these words. NATO expansion to incorporate the newly-liberated countries of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will help ensure that the Alliance remains an important guarantor of continental peace and stability in the years to come--and that America continues to play an engaged and productive role in European security. 
I do not mean to suggest that NATO expansion has no costs, or that I am entirely sanguine about its potential implications. 
I have been extremely concerned both about the anticipated financial costs of NATO expansion and about its potential impact upon U.S.-Russian relations. 
With regard to the costs of NATO to the American taxpayer, I have discussed my concerns with both Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. In particular, I have been very concerned about the great variation in cost estimates given during the last year or so, estimates that have ranged from a total of $35 billion, or even more, over the next 10 years to a total cost of a relatively small $1.5 billion, with the United States share of that $1.5 billion being approximately $400 million. 
As both Secretary Cohen and Secretary Albright have pointed out to me, the highest estimates anticipated expanding NATO to four countries, rather than three, and were not based on information now available about the condition of Eastern Europe's military infrastructure. I am thus greatly encouraged by NATO's most up-to-date financial estimates which were based upon an intensive country-by-country survey of the Polish, Czech and Hungarian defense establishments. 
This latest study, the methodology of which has been endorsed by the General Accounting Office as well as by the Department of Defense, indicates that the likely costs of NATO expansion are much lower than had been previously estimated. 
Mr. President, this study does not pull the wool over anyone's eyes. The shrinkage of the official cost estimates since early 1997, in fact, represents movement along a learning curve, and the pleasant surprise of discovering, after much analysis, that Eastern European militaries are in much better shape than previously thought is largely responsible for much of the change in the estimate. 
There will certainly be costs to military modernization in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, but most of these expenses will be borne by the new member countries themselves. Of the remainder, we will share the burden with our present NATO allies through our proportional contributions to the NATO common fund. All told, these expenses will not be significant compared to the benefits we will all reap from ensuring NATO's continuing role in securing European peace and security and stability. 
With respect to U.S.-Russian relations, I have also been encouraged by the progress of our extensive Partnership for Peace Program with Moscow and of our mutual efforts to ensure that Russia's decaying strategic nuclear infrastructure remains secure against terrorism, theft and accident. Today, Russian and NATO diplomats sit together to discuss mutual concerns on a permanent joint council convened for this purpose. U.S. nuclear experts work very closely with Russian authorities in protecting the security of Russia's nuclear establishment. 
Significantly, these crucial cooperative efforts with Russia have continued and even accelerated as NATO expansion has become more imminent. Most recently, the Russian Government announced in mid-April that it will push very hard to persuade the Duma to ratify START II strategic arms reduction agreement with the United States. These are not the hallmarks of a government preparing for a `new cold war' if Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic join our alliance. To the contrary, U.S.-Russian relations have been growing warmer, even as NATO has been preparing to expand. 
I look forward, in fact, to seeing Eastern Europe develop a whole new continuum of productive relationships with the United 
States and the West, links that range from formal NATO military ties to expanded Partnership for Peace relations, to ever more important economic and cultural ties. 
The Europe of the 21st century will not be one of haves and have-nots when it comes to transnational ties. Rather, it will be a Europe bound together in a mutually reinforcing web of different but complementary relationships stretching across the entire spectrum of public affairs. This is a Europe to which we should look forward with eager anticipation, and it is one in the creation of which NATO expansion to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic can play an important role. 
It is for these reasons, Mr. President, that after careful consideration and much deliberation I shall cast my vote in favor of NATO expansion. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, along with my colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, I am pleased today to introduce legislation that would bring about the release of certain interests of the United States in property that the Federal Government conveyed to the State of Maine more than 90 years ago. The property in question, which is situated on a bluff overlooking the Kennebec River in Augusta, Maine, is known as the Kennebec Arsenal. 
In 1905, the Secretary of the Army, acting pursuant to a Congressional mandate, executed a deed transferring the property to Maine. That conveyance was subject to the conditions that the property be used for what was then called the Maine Insane Hospital and that the United States could take possession should the President determine that the country had a need for it. In 1980, Congress provided that the first condition be broadened to allow the property to be used for any public purpose. Today, I seek to complete the transfer process through legislation that would effectively eliminate the conditions attached to the conveyance. 
Mr. President, the property is no longer needed for it former purposes, and my bill would set in motion a chain of events that would allow for new uses that would benefit not only the City of Augusta and the State of Maine but our entire country. With the exception of the Kennebec Arsenal, virtually all of the great arsenals of the nineteenth century have been demolished or so completely altered that their original appearance has been lost. The new uses contemplated by Maine would raise money needed for repairs that would maintain what historic preservation experts have described as the most perfectly intact of the nineteenth century arsenals. 
To be more specific, the State of Maine and City of Augusta plan to form a nonprofit corporation to oversee the property. That corporation would seek out private parties interested in using the land and buildings for such purposes as a marina, a museum, and a restaurant. Those parties would provide the capital for infrastructure development that would likely include sidewalks, streets, water, sewer and other utility service, and landscaping. In addition, the Arsenal's retaining wall needs repair, and a marina cannot be established without substantial dredging of the river. 
The objective of my bill is to open the way for these improvements and new uses by eliminating any reversionary interests of the United States. The existence of such interests is a barrier to the private sector making the long-term commitments required to fund the improvements. In other words, Maine needs clear title for this plan to go forward. 
Mr. President, the Kennebec Arsenal occupies an important place in the history of Maine and the nation. It was established in 1827 to deal with the threat of invasion from Great Britain, either from across the sea or from Canada to the north. The possibility of such an invasion was seen as a major threat to American security during the first half of the nineteenth century. 
Much of the tension with the British stemmed from our disputed border with Canada, and in the late 1830's that dispute nearly blossomed into a full-scale war. While the so-called bloodless Aroostook War proved to be more talk than action, it caused a flurry of activity at the Kennebec Arsenal, with newly fabricated munitions sent there in anticipation of full-scale fighting. Fortunately, cooler heads and the arrival of the spring planting season brought the parties to the negotiating table. 
During the Mexican War, rockets and fixed ammunition were manufactured at the Arsenal and shipped to the front. During the Civil War, the post became an important depot of military stores. Indeed, a fear that Confederate guerrillas based in Canada would seek to burn the Arsenal led to the stationing of extra guards there, but despite the approach late one dark night of an unidentified boat, nothing came of this concern. During the latter half of the century, the Arsenal's importance declined, and in 1901, the Army posted an order for its abandonment. That process culminated in the legislation signed by President Theodore Roosevelt providing for the transfer of the property to the State for use as a hospital to serve the mentally ill. 
Mr. President, I have offered this greatly abbreviated history of the Kennebec Arsenal to demonstrate the value of finding uses for the property that will guarantee its permanent preservation. That is the goal of the State of Maine and the City of Augusta, and this legislation will remove an anachronistic obstacle to the realization of that goal. 
I thank you, Mr. President, and I hope to have your support for this very important legislation when it comes before the Committee on Armed Services.

Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I am very pleased to join the senior Senator from Maine and our distinguished colleague from Rhode Island in paying tribute to the extraordinary accomplishments of a former Maine Senator, George Mitchell, in bringing a new sense of hope, peace, and security to Northern Ireland. 
Mr. President, it was Samuel Johnson who said in 1777 that knowledge that you will be hanged in a fortnight does wonders to concentrate your mind. In 1998, former Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, proved the truth of this aphorism by giving the Northern Ireland peace talks a Good Friday deadline, placing upon these negotiations the equivalent, if you will, of a sunset provision that left the parties with no alternative but finally to come up with a real solution. 
This deadline accomplished its purpose wonderfully. It concentrated their minds wonderfully and led directly to the historic agreement. Some years ago, it scarcely seemed possible to imagine a Northern Ireland in which children could grow up without fear of violence and bloodshed. Today, however, due to the extraordinary efforts of former Senator George Mitchell, this brighter future is not only imaginable--it is very nearly here. 
That Senator Mitchell should possess such statesmanship and skill is, of course, no surprise to the people in my home State of Maine. Senator Mitchell is greatly admired in this country for his work on behalf of the citizens of Maine and indeed of all Americans. Today, however, the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland--and peace-loving people everywhere--also owe Senator Mitchell a great debt for helping to steer these talks to their successful conclusion. I do not believe that we would be celebrating this agreement without his heroic efforts. 
It is my great hope that with his statesmanship and steady hand, Senator Mitchell has now made it possible to achieve a real reconciliation in Northern Ireland--and for the Irish people to go about building their future together, in cooperation rather than in conflict. 
I am very pleased that the Senate has passed overwhelmingly a resolution expressing our support for the Irish peace process and the brighter future represented by this truly historic agreement. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.

Ms. COLLINS. I rise in support of No. 555 on the Executive Calendar, the nomination of Kermit Lipez, of Maine, to the first circuit. 
 Mr. President, it is an honor and a pleasure to rise to speak in support of the nomination of Justice Kermit Lipez to serve on the First Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Having spent the past 12 years as a member of the Maine judiciary, Justice Lipez is a highly respected jurist. With experience at both the trial and appellate court levels, it is fair to say that he has been tested for the position for which he has now been nominated and that he has passed that test with flying colors. 
Justice Lipez is universally praised in Maine for his judicial temperament, his sense of fairness, and his intellectual capabilities. His demeanor is consistently that of a gentleman, treating witnesses, jurors, attorneys, and spectators with great respect, and ensuring that others follow his example. He makes the courtroom a far less intimidating place for the average person. 
Justice Lipez's reputation for impartiality is reflected in the high regard in which he is held by all segments of the bar. Indeed, people who agree on little else agree on his sense of fairness. He was appointed to the Maine Superior Court by a Democratic Governor, he was appointed to the Maine Supreme Court by a Republican Governor, and he was recently praised by an Independent Governor. If public trust in our court system hinges on the belief that the courtroom is a place where everyone can expect equal treatment, no one in Maine has done more to promote that perception than Justice Lipez. 
The nominee is also a man who combines great intellectual acumen with considerable common sense. He has that rare ability to deal with the most cerebral of issues while keeping his feet planted firmly on the ground. Despite the talent he possesses and the respect he commands, he is a person of humility, an essential trait for someone empowered to sit in judgment of others. 
Mr. President, Kermit Lipez's dedication to his profession is beyond question. As a judge's son, he came to the bench with considerable knowledge of the judicial function. Yet, shortly after his appointment to the State Superior Court, he took the unusual step of obtaining a master's degree in judicial process from the University of Virginia School of Law. 
Justice Lipez understands not only the powers of a judge but also the limits on those powers. To use his own words, courts exist to resolve `particularized disputes. They do not decide the wisdom of laws. . . . [They] squander their resources and their authority when they try to manage problems or impose solutions beyond their competence and their proper role.' 
Mr. President, Justice Lipez has excelled in everything he has undertaken--whether as a legislative aide to former Senator Muskie, a private practitioner, a trial judge, or a Justice on Maine's Supreme Judicial Court--and I am confident that he will excel as a member of the First Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Senator Snowe has been a very strong advocate for Justice Kermit Lipez. It was, in fact, Senator Snowe's husband who appointed Justice Lipez to the court in Maine. I am delighted to be here tonight to speak on behalf of this nomination.

Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
All of us agree that medically necessary patient care should never be sacrificed to the bottom line, and that medical decisionmaking should remain in the hands of medical professionals, and not in the hands of accountants. The question is, how can we best achieve that goal? 
Is the answer, as the Senator from Massachusetts suggests, massive new Federal regulations, mandates, and a preemption of the State's traditional role to regulate insurance? Or is the answer to trust the private-sector organizations that have made great progress in improving the quality of health care plans? Or is, perhaps, the answer somewhere in between? Is the answer carefully crafted, minimal Federal legislation that supports the efforts in the private sector? 
The reason this issue is so important is because we don't want to take a misguided step in the name of improving quality and end up making health insurance unaffordable for millions of Americans. 
The Lewin Group recently released an important study that deserves the attention of all of our colleagues. It estimates that every 1 percent increase in private insurance premiums results in an additional 400,000 Americans who become uninsured. A 1 percent increase in costs brings 400,000 additional uninsured Americans. 
Health insurance rates are already projected to increase by more than 5 percent in 1998. In fact, the Los Angeles Times reported earlier this week that California's largest HMO was seeking an 11 percent increase in some rates. Therefore, we face an extremely delicate balancing act as we attempt to respond to concerns about quality without resorting to unduly burdensome Federal Government controls and mandates that will further drive up the cost of insurance and reduce access. Furthermore, we want to make certain that our efforts actually improve the quality of health care and not simply increase the amount of Federal regulation. 
Under the leadership of the Senator from Oklahoma, I serve on the Republican health quality task force. We recently heard from the director of the Mayo Clinic, who voiced their own reservations about the Federal Government's ability to regulate quality. To quote Dr. Bob Waller: 
Quality is a continuous process that must be woven into the fabric of how we think, act and feel. Government regulation places a stake in the ground that freezes in place a quality standard that may become obsolete very quickly. The Government simply cannot react quickly to the changing quality environment. The goal of quality is to continuously improve patient care--not to achieve some defined regulatory objective. 
Congress, in its haste to do good, should take care not to violate the first principle of medicine, which is, `first of all, do no harm.' Congress should not be acting precipitously, but rather should engage in a thoughtful and thorough debate on how best to ensure that Americans continue to enjoy the highest quality health care in the world. The amendment offered by the assistant majority leader adopts a reasoned, balanced approach to improving health care quality. All of us should be able to agree, as the amendment states, that Congress should not do anything to make health insurance unaffordable for working families and to increase the number of uninsured Americans.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I join the senior Senator from the State of Maine, Senator Snowe, in urging my colleagues to enact H.R. 629, legislation that would ratify the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact, also known as the Texas Compact. 
In entering into an agreement for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, the States of Maine, Texas, and Vermont followed the direction established by the Congress in the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act and its 1985 amendments. That legislation contemplated that states would form agreements of this nature for the disposal of low-level waste, and thus, by ratifying the compact, Congress will be completing a process that it set in motion. 
Mr. President, since 1985 Congress has ratified nine compacts involving 41 states. Put differently, 82 of the 100 members of this body live in states with compacts that have been ratified by the Senate, and with the approval of the Texas Compact, that number will rise to 88. In short, what Maine, Texas, and Vermont are seeking today has already been routinely granted to the vast majority of the states. 
While the disposal of radioactive waste is bound to generate controversy, this agreement has been overwhelmingly approved by the Legislatures of the three compacting states, signed by their governors, and in the case of Maine, endorsed by the voters in a referendum. This is consistent with the congressional determination that the states bear responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, and that in the interest of limiting the number of disposal sites, they work together to carry out this responsibility. Indeed, ratification by Congress is necessitated only because state-imposed limitations on the importation of waste would otherwise violate the Commerce Clause. 
Mr. President, a member of this body has criticized the proposed disposal site to be established pursuant to this compact. Apart from the fact that the location of the site is a matter for the states to determine, that criticism is unsupported by the facts. 
In the selection of the proposed site in Hudspeth County, Texas, there was extensive public involvement, as well as thorough environmental and technical reviews. Hudspeth County was found to have the two critical characteristics for a disposal site, namely, very little rainfall and very low population density. Indeed, the county is the size of the State of Connecticut and has a population of only 2800 people. 
While some may wish to use this legislation to pursue a larger ideological agenda, it does not square with the facts. The choice of Hudspeth County had nothing to do with who lives there; it had everything to do with the fact that very few people live there. 
Mr. President, this body has been presented with nine low-level radioactive waste compacts. It has ratified each one without change. In keeping with congressionally established policy for the disposal of low-level waste, Maine, Texas, and Vermont are seeking the same treatment.

<TEXT>
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Small Business Paperwork Reduction Act Amendments of 1998, a companion bill to legislation pending in the House of Representatives. 
This legislation has five components. First, it requires the Office of Management and Budget to publish annually in the Federal Register and on the Internet all of the Federal paperwork requirements imposed on small business. This will not only serve as a valuable tool for those who must comply with these mandates, but it will also make it far easier for policy makers to monitor, and I would hope check, the growth in the paperwork burden. 
Second, under the bill, each agency will have to establish one point of contact to act as a liaison with small businesses on paperwork requirements. In an era when serving the customer has become recognized by the private sector as critical, this is a modest step to ask of our government. 
Third, the legislation provides for the suspension of civil fines imposed on small enterprises for first-time paperwork violations, except under certain circumstances, such as when the violation causes serious harm to the public or presents an imminent danger to the public health or safety. In dealing with America's entrepreneurs, we need to move away from a culture that seems to place a higher priority on imposing punishment than on facilitating compliance. 
Fourth, in addition to meeting the mandates of the Paperwork Reduction Act, agencies will have to make further efforts to reduce the burden on enterprises with fewer than 25 employees. There must be some measure of proportionality between the size of a business and its costs of complying with government regulation. 
Fifth, a task force will be established to examine the feasibility of requiring agencies to consolidate their paperwork mandates in a manner that will allow small businesses to satisfy those mandates through a single filing, in a single format, and on the same date. By reducing the amount of time currently devoted to these tasks, our companies will have more to spend on the activities for which they were formed. 
Mr. President, all too often the relationship between the owners of small businesses and government is an adversial one. That benefits no one--not the owners of these enterprises, not the many Americans they employ, not the government they help to support, and not the public at large. 
The problem often is not with the goals which underlie our regulations, but rather in how we seek to achieve those goals. We should not forget that we are dealing with Americans who make a great contribution to the prosperity of our nation. In seeking to meet our regulatory objectives, we should be reaching out to these entrepreneurs with a helping hand and not a heavy hand. That, Mr. President, is the purpose of this legislation.

I refer, of course, to the unprecedented Ice Storm that began, innocently enough, as a light rain on the morning of January 7, 1998 and ended four days later with our State encased in as much as 10 inches of solid ice. The additional CDBG funding will help not only Maine, but New York and Vermont as well, rebuild the electric infrastructure of our three states. 
I want to pay a special thanks to the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to the Chairman of the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, and to all of the Committee members for recognizing the harm caused by the Ice Storm and for providing a mechanism whereby we can secure sorely needed aid. Their cooperation is greatly appreciated by the people of Maine. 
Mr. President, the Ice Storm of 1998 was unlike anything Maine had ever seen. Having grown up in the most northern part of the State, I know something about ice and snow. But this was less like a storm and more like a carefully targeted and highly effective attack on our electric transmission and distribution system. The damage to that system in Maine alone was $81 million, a formidable sum for the ratepayers of a small state. 
Mr. President, there is an erroneous belief in some quarters that because the CDBG money would be used to rebuild the electric infrastructure of investor owned utilities, it will benefit a private corporation and its shareholders. That is not the case. Under the law, a utility earning less than its allowed rate of return, as is the situation with the two Maine utilities, is constitutionally entitled to pass along prudently incurred costs to its ratepayers. And there can be little doubt that the cost of rebuilding the system by which electricity is delivered to our homes and businesses is not only a prudent cost, but indeed, a cost that must be incurred. 
Let me make this point somewhat differently. Without federal help, the money to rebuild the system will not come from corporate coffers. It will not come from the pockets of company executives. It will not come from the dividends or equity of shareholders. 
Who will bear the expense? It will be the elderly widow who heats her mobile home with electricity and is already struggling to pay her bills. It will be the small company that uses electricity in its manufacturing process and is already fighting an uphill battle because its power costs are 40% above the national average. Indeed, it will be virtually all Maine's ratepayers, who because we all use electricity, are really the same as Maine's taxpayers. That makes them the very people who have paid their fair share to help defray the costs of natural disasters that have struck other regions. 
Mr. President, let me dispel another potential misconception. This assistance will not result in special treatment for the citizens of Maine, New York, and Vermont, but rather put them on an equal footing with people in other parts of the country. 
To be more specific, it is well established that federal emergency aid can be made available to municipally owned utilities and electric cooperatives. Some might argue that ours is a different situation, in that we are dealing with investor owned utilities. Once again, that argument would make sense if the utility stood to benefit from the relief. But it is the ratepayers who will be assisted by this amendment, and there is no reason why the victims of a natural disaster should be helped if they are customers of a municipal utility or an electric cooperative but not if they are customers of an investor owned utility. 
Mr. President, in the case at hand, the utilities are really like the post office. They deliver the bills; they do not pay them. Without the CDBG money made available through this amendment, the people who will pay are those to whom the bills will ultimately come--the ordinary citizens of Maine, New York, and Vermont. And since, unlike a progressive tax system, electric rates are not based on income, those who will be hurt the most will be those least able to afford it. 
Let me also emphasize that to use the money provided by this amendment to rebuild our electric infrastructure does not require legislation to authorize a new type of spending. That authority is already found in existing HUD regulations. To quote the relevant language,  
CDBG funds may be used to acquire, construct, reconstruct, rehabilitate, or install the distribution lines of privately owned utilities. . . . 
In short, this amendment provides the funds to carry out an already existing program under circumstances where that program is urgently needed by the citizens of our three states. 
To give my colleagues a better understanding of the source of that need, I would offer a description of the storm not in my words but in the words of `The President's Action Plan for Recovery from the January 1998 Ice Storm.' 
The storms of January 1998 will not soon be forgotten. . . . While ice storms are not uncommon to the region, the system that battered the . . . region in early January was unprecedented. Below-freezing temperatures combined with record rainfall to cover an area extending from Western New York to Maine with solid ice. . . . 
The results were staggering. Massive tree limbs shattered under the weight of the ice, choking roads and trails with wood debris. Power lines snapped, leaving communities without electrical power in bone chilling temperatures. At the height of the crisis, nearly 500,000 homes and businesses were without electric power. 
Of greatest significance is the following observation in the President's report: `The single most critical concern is the loss of electric power caused by the storm.' 
Let me supplement the description in the President's report with facts from Maine. For at least some part of the storm, more than 800,000 people, or seven our of every ten of our residents, lost power. In most instances, they went without electricity for days, lasting in some cases as long as two weeks. When you contemplate this, keep in mind that it occurred in the dead of winter--not a Washington winter but a Maine winter. 
The storm spared no one. Not homes, not businesses, not public buildings. Schools across the southern half of the State closed, causing some to cancel their winter vacations to make up part of the lost time. Even the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine lost power for more than a week, during which time it struggled mightily to track weather developments with a less than fully reliable generator. For many, the experience was like the movie, `The Day the Earth Stood Still.' Only it lasted far more than a day and occurred during the most difficult time of year. 
The restoration of power involved a monumental effort taking 17 days. Twelve hundred utility crews from as far away as Nova Scotia, North Carolina, and Michigan were sent to Maine to help with the effort. Approximately 3000 utility poles and three million feet of electric cable had to be replaced. All of the poles in one ten-mile stretch were down, cutting off power to a large section of a rural county. In the words of Maine's Governor, it seemed like a huge monster had walked across the state deliberately stepping on all of the electric lines in its path. 
As if guided by a perverse force, the Ice Storm of 1998 struck a region with some of the highest electric prices in the country. The rates in both Maine and the affected areas of New York are 40% above the national average. Thus, without this federal assistance, the rebuilding costs will fall on some of our country's most heavily burdened ratepayers. 
Some of the areas hit by the storm were already economically distressed. Indeed, looking at the entire region, one observer has concluded that the victims of the storm were predominantly persons of low and moderate income who, even without increased electric rates, have been seriously harmed by this disaster. 
Mr. President, the two utilities serving the areas affected by the storm in Maine are not wealthy. Indeed, one has been wrestling with serious money problems, and the financial performance of the other has been mediocre at best. 
Furthermore, while they are private companies, they are also public utilities. When the ice storm hit, they could not shut down operations. They could not leave the state until times were better. To the contrary, they had a legal and moral obligation to do whatever it took to restore power to people desperately in need of electricity. While their performance will ultimately be judged by the State Public Utilities Commission, there is no evidence that they made anything less than a maximum effort to discharge their public responsibility. 
Under these circumstances, should the utilities be able to recover from the ratepayers the cost of rebuilding Maine's electric infrastructure? I would be hard pressed to say that would be an unreasonable result, but in the final analysis, my opinion is irrelevant. What matters, and the only thing that matters, is that the law mandates such a result. 
Mr. President, on a comparative basis, Maine is not affluent, but its people have a generous spirit. They believe in helping their neighbors, whether those neighbors live across the street or 3000 miles away. 
They have gladly paid their fair share to help their neighbors in California recover from earthquakes, to help their neighbors in the Midwest recover from floods, and to help their neighbors in the Southeast recover from hurricanes. Their generosity has to not been limited to money, as they have sent men and women to fight forest fires in the Northwest. They have not split hairs over the precise source or nature of the harm. As long as the ultimate victims of a disaster have been ordinary citizens like themselves, they have stood ready to help. 
Mr. Chairman, the situation has changed, and we are now the neighbor in need of assistance. By making funds available to help us defray the costs of rebuilding our electric infrastructure, our neighbors will be treating us as we have treated them.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, in introducing the Workplace Information, Readability and Electronic Dissemination (or WIRED) Act, which will significantly improve the ability of both workers and employers to use and understand the Material Safety Data Sheets that accompany potentially hazardous chemicals used in the workplace. 
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration rightly requires employers to provide information to their employees about hazardous chemicals used in the workplace on Material Safety Data Sheets, or MSDSs. These MSDSs, which are provided by the manufacturer, must be `readily accessible' to employees during each work shift and must include information about the manufacturer, the physical properties of the chemical, health precautions that should be taken, and instructions on how to handle spills and other emergencies. 
OSHA issued the rule requiring MSDSs in the workplace in the early 1980s, well before computers and fax machines became routine fixtures in virtually every workplace. As a consequence, employers are required to keep huge, loose-leaf notebooks or file cabinets filled with handwritten or printed MSDSs in the workplace at all times. More often than not, the MSDSs are tattered, stained and out-of-date since, in an average inventory, as many as 7 percent will become obsolete within a month. Finding the right MSDS quickly in an emergency under these circumstances can be a real challenge, particularly since they can easily be misfiled. 
In this age of electronic communication, there simply are better ways for employers and employees to maintain and access this important safety information. Currently, there are a number of different products on the market such as CD-ROMs and fax-on-demand response systems that provide all the MSDS information an employer or employee might need within minutes of the request. Businesses contend that these services are more efficient, since they allow an independent service to maintain the information and the employees to access the information instantaneously and at will. Not only are computer systems faster, but they also enable employees to cross-reference different chemicals. These electronic systems are certainly better that the current paper system required by OSHA, which requires fumbling through a notebook or file cabinet, hoping that the MSDSs are current and filed correctly. 
Unfortunately, OSHA will not allow employers to replace their paper MSDS systems with electronic access. As a consequence, many employers have been reluctant to take advantage of these superior new systems. The legislation we are introducing today will enable employers to bring their MSDS system into the 21st century by clarifying that employers have the option of replacing their paper system with electronic access, as long as the new system is readily available to all employees. 
Another problem with the current system is that the information presented on a MSDS is extremely technical and complicated, making it difficult for many employees to understand, particularly when an accident has occurred and time is of the essence. Not only is the information on the MSDS itself technical, but it is also presented in language that is too advanced for the vast majority of manufacturing workers to understand. According to a review of the National Center for Education Statistics 1992 Adult Literacy Survey, the information on a typical MSDS requires a Level 5 reading proficiency, while the same survey shows that manufacturing workers typically read at a Level 2. 
This situation is complicated by the fact that there is no standard format for MSDSs and different manufacturers have different formats for presenting the same information. This makes it difficult for employees who must look at more than one MSDS to find the information they need quickly, and quick information is particularly important in an emergency. The legislation we are introducing today will therefore require OSHA not only to standardize the format for MSDSs, but also to ensure that they are written at a literacy level that is appropriate for the typical industrial worker. 
Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today will not only make it easier for employers to comply with important OSHA safety standards, but it will also ensure that their employees have better access to accurate and up-to-date safety information that they can both read and understand. Enactment of the WIRED Act will result in safer, more efficient workplaces, and I encourage all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.

Ms. COLLINS. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee for his courtesy. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain. I cannot speak to the value of some of the projects which he has singled out in this amendment, but I can speak to the necessity of providing assistance to the maple sugar producers in northern New England. 
Maine and other northern New England States recently endured the ice storm of the century. Part of the result of that ice storm was extensive damage to the forests in Maine. Our maple sugar producers have been severely hurt by the ice storm. Their trees may well take a very long time to recover. These maple sugar producers in northern New England have fallen through the cracks of our traditional disaster assistance programs. They need our assistance. This bill would provide a modest amount of money, $4.48 million in funds, that are desperately needed for these small maple sugar producers to recover from the impact of this devastating storm. 
The amendment of the Senator from Arizona also raises important public policy issues. We have more than one branch of government in this country. The idea that the President and the President alone should solely dictate what is in an urgent supplemental bill should give us all cause for alarm. It is inconsistent with the traditions of this noble body and it is contrary to the public interests. 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote to table the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of public education. Increasingly, more education is key to the American dream. I would not support any legislation that I felt in any way undermines this country's commitment to public education. 
There have been a lot of myths and misinformation circulated about the bill that the distinguished Senator from Georgia has taken such a leadership role in drafting and bringing to the floor. I would like to engage the Senator from Georgia in a colloquy in an attempt to put to rest some of the misinformation that has been circulated about his proposal. 
First, I want to commend him for his leadership. I know that he is sincerely committed to improving the quality of education in this country. He has been a real leader on this issue, and it has been a pleasure and a privilege to work with him. The Senator from Georgia and I have had many conversations about this bill. I, too, had some misinformation about it in the beginning, and the Senator from Georgia was able to alleviate my concerns. 
For the record, I would like to publicly ask some questions of the Senator from Georgia so that everyone may have the benefit of this information. 
First, as the Senator from Georgia knows, I oppose vouchers because they would divert needed funds from our public schools. I would ask the Senator from Georgia, does this bill in any way divert money from local school districts that would otherwise be used for public education? 
Does this bill in any way authorize school vouchers?

Ms. COLLINS. Similarly, I ask the Senator from Georgia to clarify that the money in these A+ accounts could be used in fact to assist children that are attending public schools. I believe that is one of the purposes of this bill. For example, am I correct in believing that parents whose children attend public schools could use the money set aside in these savings accounts to purchase a computer, for example, or to hire a tutor to help their children, or perhaps to pay for a school trip--again, all related to the public schools? Is my understanding correct?

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to engage the distinguished chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in a colloquy in order to clarify that a specific kind of innovative materials research will be eligible for funding under this bill. 
Many of our Nation's bridges have been in service far longer than originally planned. As a result, they have fallen into a state of serious disrepair. Many of them are in need of outright replacement. Over the past several years, the Federal Government has supported research in an effort to develop a new, stronger, and more environmentally sensitive material for use in bridge construction. One of the most promising developments in this area is a new technology known as `wood composites.' These materials combine wood, an abundant and renewable resource, with modern composites to give the wood significantly more strength and durability. 
I am proud to say that the University of Maine's Advanced Engineered Wood Composites Center has been a leader in developing wood composite technologies, and it has done so in part with research funds from the National Science Foundation. That research has now advanced to the point where composite-reinforced wood is being used in pilot projects in Maine and elsewhere in the United States. 
Wood composites have shown a great deal of promise as a means of providing low-cost, extremely durable, and environmentally safe material for building and repairing bridges. Given its performance and its promise, we should be enthusiastically promoting further development of this exciting new technology. 
I have discussed with the chairman my strong support for ensuring that the research involving wood composites, specifically wood fiber-reinforced plastic composites, will be eligible for funding under the sections of this legislation. Specifically, the bill authorizes funding to: First, establish four new national university transportation centers; second, section 2005 of the bill authorizes funding for the Department of Transportation's basic research and technology programs over the next 6 years; third, section 2001 of the bill authorizes funding for the Federal Highway Administration's National Technology Deployment Initiatives and Partnership Program; and, finally, section 2013 of the legislation authorizes funding for an innovative bridge research and construction program. 
The purpose of my colloquy with the distinguished chairman today is to confirm my understanding that the ongoing research involving wood FRP composites is eligible for funding under all of these sections of the ISTEA reauthorization bill, and further that the University of Maine's Wood Composites Center will be eligible to apply for designation as one of the new NUTCs authorized in the bill. 
I yield to my distinguished friend and colleague from Rhode Island, the chairman of the committee, Senator Chafee, for any reassurances that he might be able to give me in this regard.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to curtail a fraudulent practice known as slamming--the unauthorized change of a customer's telephone service provider. Telephone slamming is a widespread and growing problem. In Maine, for example, slamming complaints to the local telephone company increased by 100% from 1996 to 1997. Nationwide, slamming is also the number one telephone-related complaint to the FCC. While the FCC received a total of more than 20,000 slamming complaints in 1997, a significant increase over the previous year, estimates from phone companies indicated that as many as one million people were slammed last year. 
Last fall, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, undertook an extensive investigation of the slamming problem. On February 18th, I chaired a field hearing on slamming in Portland, Maine. My distinguished colleague, Senator Richard Durbin, joined me at the hearing, and we heard first-hand from several consumers about the problems they experienced with telephone slamming. 
At the Subcommittee hearing, Maine slamming victims explained how some long-distance companies used fraudulent or deceptive practices to change their telephone service. Witnesses used words such as `stealing,' and `criminal,' and `break-in' to describe practices employed by unscrupulous telephone companies to switch unsuspecting customers and boost profits. 
One witness, Pamela Corrigan from West Farmington, Maine, testified that she was sent an unsolicited `welcome package' in the mail, which looked like the stacks of junk mail that we receive every day. However, this `junk mail' was not what it appeared to be. This `welcome package' automatically signed her up for a new long distance service unless she returned a card rejecting the change. She was amazed and appalled that it was possible for a company to change her long distance service simply because she did not respond that she did not want their service. 
Another witness, Susan Deblois from Winthrop, Maine, testified that when she was slammed, her children were unable to use the 800 number she had for them to call home in case of an emergency. 
Slamming not only affects families but also small businesses and communities. For example, Steve Klein, the owner of Mermaid Transportation Company in Portland, Maine, testified that his business phone lines, which are critical to his livelihood, were tied up for four days which he was slammed by a long-distance telephone reseller which falsely represented itself as AT&T. 
Similarly, Ms. Corrigan, who is the town manager of Farmington, Maine, reported that the town's phone lines were also slammed. Simply put, Mr. President, no one is immune from this illegal activity. 
Victims of slamming are frustrated. They are angry. They should not have to spend their time and energy resolving problems that are not of their own making. People rely on their home and business telephone service, and they should be able to choose their own long-distance company without fear that their decision will be changed without their consent. 
Deliberate slamming is like stealing and should not be tolerated. The FCC must step up enforcement efforts to make sure that existing laws and regulations are followed by telephone companies, and Congress must act to strengthen penalties to halt this pernicious practice. 
The comprehensive legislation that I am introducing today, along with my colleague Senator Durbin, will attack the problem of slamming from all sides. 
First, the bill gets tough with those who engage in deliberate slamming. It would increase civil penalties and establish new criminal penalties for intentional slamming. Specifically, civil penalties would be increased to a minimum of $50,000 for the first slamming offense and $100,000 for a subsequent offense. 
Criminal penalties would be established for intentional slamming, the same as those for any other federal crime: a maximum of $100,000 and one year imprisonment for a misdemeanor and $250,000 and five years imprisonment for a felony. In addition, anyone convicted of intentional slamming will be disqualified from being a telecommunications service provider. The bill would also allow the states to bring action in federal court against slammers on behalf of its residents, a provision suggested by Senator Durbin. 
Second, our legislation increases consumer protection. It would give control back to consumers by taking the financial incentive away from companies that engage in slamming. Rather than paying the slamming company, consumers could pay their original carrier at their previous rate. It would further protect consumers by eliminating the so-called `welcome package' method of verification, a favorite tool of slammers, which is misused and deceptive. 
Third, the bill strongly encourages the FCC to step up its enforcement efforts against slamming. It would require local telephone companies to report a summary of slamming complaints to the FCC for further investigation, and it would require the FCC to report to Congress on its enforcement actions against slammers. 
Finally, the legislation would require the FCC to report to Congress on whether or not its current procedures contain sufficient safeguards to prevent unscrupulous telecommunications providers from receiving an FCC license in the first place. 
Mr. President, consumers have lost control over their telecommunications service to unscrupulous providers. The Collins-Durbin legislation would go a long way toward halting slamming. I urge my colleagues to join me in the fight against slamming by co-sponsoring the `Telephone Slamming Prevention Act of 1998.' 
For the information of all my colleagues, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a detailed summary of the provisions contained in this comprehensive anti-slamming bill.

Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 1173, the highway reauthorization legislation currently pending before the Senate. Passage of this ISTEA legislation will be very beneficial to the people of my State and to Maine's economy. 
Before beginning my remarks tonight, I commend the distinguished managers of this comprehensive legislation, Senator John Chafee and Senator Max Baucus. They have worked diligently to produce a broad, bipartisan consensus for this complicated 6-year reauthorization bill. I commend them for their efforts today, and I look forward to working with them as this legislation continues to move through the Senate, be passed by the House, be reconciled in conference and ultimately to be signed into law by the President. 
The State of Maine has 1.2 million people. They are spread out across roughly 34,000 square miles. Our State has, by far, the lowest population density in all of New England. Consequently, continuing to improve and upgrade our roads, our highways, our bridges is essential to Maine's future prosperity. 
Studies have shown that roughly 80 percent of all economic development occurs within 10 miles on either side of our interstate highway. Thus, the expansion and improvement of our transportation system are vital to increasing job opportunities for all the citizens of our State. 
From Maine's perspective, the 1998 ISTEA legislation builds upon the successes of the 1991 law and will continue to provide Maine with needed funding to build, repair, and maintain our surface transportation system into the 21st century. 
Madam President, Maine, like other northeastern States, is facing an aging transportation infrastructure. It requires maintenance, rehabilitation, and in some cases outright replacement. S. 1173, as amended, would provide Maine with vitally needed funds for transportation. It would provide a much-needed boost in the funding that would go to my State. 
Under the 1991 ISTEA law, Maine received approximately $118 million in annual highway funding. With the adoption of the amendment worked out by the Senator from Rhode Island last week, which I strongly supported, this legislation will now authorize $144 million in transportation spending for Maine annually. 
This, Madam President, is good news for our State. It represents a 22 percent increase over the average of the State under the 1991 law. Clearly, this increase will be very beneficial for the people of Maine. The ability of the economy of Maine to grow and offer new and exciting job opportunities to its people is directly related to the quality and the availability of our transportation system. In addition, the higher funding levels should enable the State to pursue some very high-priority transportation projects over the next 6 years. 
For example, Madam President, as a native of Aroostook County, I have long been a strong supporter of a four-lane, limited-access highway project in Aroostook County. We need such a highway--all the way from Houlton to Fort Kent--and I am committed to doing everything possible to assist in this vital effort. The higher funding levels authorized by this legislation should enable the State of Maine to continue moving this vitally important project forward by completing the next stage, the environmental studies. 
Another important transportation project for Maine will be the efforts to improve our roads and highways that cross the State in an east-west direction. There is also considerable interest in the State in undertaking studies to look at constructing an east-west highway to improve trade and opportunity throughout the State. 
In recent years, the prospect of an east-west highway has been getting more and more attention, and the increased highway funding contained in the legislation before us today will assist the State in exploring this exciting new opportunity. Madam President, the ISTEA legislation will also help the State of Maine with other important priorities, such as replacing aging bridges, developing our cargo ports, and improving critical economic corridors throughout the entire State. 
These suggest a few of the very important transportation projects that the State of Maine can and should consider moving forward with just as soon as this Congress completes action on the long-term surface transportation reauthorization. 
Madam President, the ISTEA legislation will help Maine and its people maintain and develop a transportation system that will meet the challenges of the future. Again, I commend the distinguished managers of this bill for all of their hard work, and I am very pleased to support their efforts in passing this much needed and vitally important legislation.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act, to reduce the burdensome reporting requirements imposed on educational institutions by the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credits. I am very pleased to be joined by my principal cosponsor, the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, who has been a real leader in education issues. I am also pleased to have the Presiding Officer, Senator Gordon Smith, as one of my cosponsors as well as Senators Bond, Enzi, Faircloth, Hatch, Helms, Hutchison, and Roberts. 
Mr. President, when Congress created the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit, it, unfortunately, at the same time also created a very burdensome and costly reporting requirement for our universities, our colleges, and our proprietary schools. Beginning with the tax year 1998, the regulations will require schools to report to the IRS information on their students--including name, address, Social Security number, information about attendance status, program level, a campus contact, and the amount of qualified tuition and student aid. 
Mr. President, this is a perfect example of the law of unintended consequences. We have inadvertently imposed a costly burden on our institutions of higher education. In the words of the president of the University of Maine at Farmington: 
At a time when we are working to increase access and to contain college costs, new government reporting requirements are working against us. 
We will need to add personnel, not in support of our educational functions, but to comply with the new IRS regulations. This is not sensible and it is definitely not in the interests of the people we are here to serve. 
Mr. President, she said it very well. This is not sensible and it is not in the interests of the people that we are here to serve. 
Yet another example from my State comes from the University of Maine at Presque Isle, a small campus with fewer than 1,000 students. The President there has told me that he may well need to hire an additional person to oversee the data collection and reporting requirements of this new law. Indeed, Mr. President, analysis of these reporting requirements indicate that they will cost America's postsecondary educational institutions as much as $125 million, and that is just to set up the system. In addition, tens of millions of dollars will have to be spent each year on an ongoing basis to comply with these onerous new regulations. 
Mr. President, this simply does not make sense. The Collins-DeWine bill will repeal the provision of the Internal Revenue Code that requires a school to report this information for its students. Instead, Mr. President, we will treat these educational tax credits just the way we would treat any kind of tax credit. Taxpayers will be required to report the necessary information on their tax returns and to maintain records of their expenses that will support any tax credits that they claim. 
Mr. President, the rationale for the Hope and Lifetime Learning education credits is to make postsecondary education both more affordable and thus more accessible to lower income individuals. But in this case, Mr. President, what Congress is giving with one hand it is taking away at least in part with its regulatory hand. The cost of conforming to these regulatory requirements will inevitably result in increases in tuition, chipping away at the very benefit of these tax credits. 
Mr. President, the American Council on Education strongly supports this bill. It will help avoid a wasteful expenditure of the resources, the scarce resources, of America's colleges and universities.

Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, there is much in the amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky that I support. I particularly support its expansion of outreach efforts designed to help emerging small businesses compete for Federal contracts. 
I think that those specific provisions of the amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky would truly be very helpful to a lot of small businesses regardless of their ownership. Moreover, I share the opposition of the Senator from Kentucky to numerical quotas. I don't like the numerical quotas that are in current law. Whether or not they are constitutionally suspect, they are certainly inflexible, and they are often unfair. 
I am also opposed to creating a permanent entitlement or preference for businesses based upon their ownership by minorities or women. We should be providing such businesses a hand up, not a permanent handout. However, I believe that the amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky goes too far. In my view, the programs funded under ISTEA should include a nonnumerical goal--not a quota, not a 10-percent set-aside, but a goal aimed at increasing participation by disadvantaged business enterprises. 
Unfortunately, the Senator from Kentucky has indicated that he is unwilling to alter his proposal in this manner, and, for that reason, I am going to vote against his amendment. 
Mr. President, we all talk about the legalities of this issue. But I would like to try to put a human face on the matter before us. Let me tell you of a specific example of the benefits of the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program, a specific case involving a woman from Maine named Tina Woodman. Tina, in her own words, went from being a waitress to being an ironworker, to being the president of her own company. As a matter of fact, I talked with Tina just this afternoon about her story, with which I was already very familiar. 
Tina, after receiving specialized training, was able to go from being a waitress for 10 years to learning to be an ironworker, to opening up and becoming president of her own company, Maine Rebar Services. In fact, she and her company worked this past summer on the Casco Bay Bridge project in Maine, one of the largest construction projects our State has ever had. 
By building her own business, Tina has not only been able to provide for her 6-year-old daughter, but for the first time in her life she has also been able to buy her own home. She told me, and her daughter told me, that the best part of this was that they could now plant flowers in their own front yard. 
Every time I drive across or see the Casco Bay Bridge, I think of Tina Woodman, and I think of her daughter and the flowers growing in their front yard. 
All of this wonderful story would never have come about but for the opportunity given to Tina through the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program. Hers is the kind of success story that this kind of program can bring about when it is properly applied. 
Mr. President, we do need to reform this program. We need to make sure that it is carefully tailored so as to give people a little bit of a hand up so that they can participate in the American dream. 
For this reason, Mr. President, I am going to reluctantly oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky. I hope, however, that he and others will be willing to work with me in order to reshape these programs. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the managers of the bill, and I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, thank you. 
Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the compromise amendment offered by our distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, and the Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. President, I am confident that the original language in the McCain-Feingold bill relating to the issue ads would have withstood constitutional scrutiny. But the careful work of the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Vermont certainly removes any doubt on that score. They have done an artful job in crafting this language, and I hope it will receive the support of every Senator. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the time has come to strike an important blow for our democracy by making some limited, but urgently needed, repairs to our campaign finance laws. 
Mr. President, the legislation currently pending before this body is dramatically different from the original McCain-Feingold bill, which I cosponsored and supported. It does not seek to radically alter how we finance our campaigns. Indeed, I submit that it does not alter at all the basic framework that Congress established more than two decades ago. 
Nevertheless, Mr. President, the bill before us today is vitally important. 
Before us today is a bill designed to close election law loopholes that undermine the protections the American people were promised in the aftermath of Watergate. Unlike the prior version of the bill, it will not make new reforms to our campaign finance system. Rather, it will merely restore prior reforms. 
Let me be more specific, Mr. President. Gone from S. 25 are the provisions intended to create a different system for financing campaigns. Gone are the voluntary limits on campaign spending. Gone is the free TV time. Gone is the discounted TV time. Gone is the reduction in PAC limits. 
Most of these reforms continue to be very important, and they are reforms to which I remain personally committed. But in the interest of securing action on the major abuses in the current system, we, the proponents of the McCain-Feingold proposal, have agreed to significant compromises. 
What, then, is left? The principal purpose of today's bill is to close two immense loopholes that have recently been exploited to evade the restrictions and the requirements of current law. I refer, of course, to soft-money contributions and bogus issue ads. 
It is fair to ask whether these are, in fact, loopholes or whether they are practices that were contemplated when our election laws were enacted in the 1970s. To be more specific, when Congress put a $1,000 limit on campaign contributions, was it intended that individuals could make unlimited contributions to political parties that, often following a circuitous route, would wind up financing ads clearly designed to help or to harm particular candidates? Clearly, Mr. President, the answer is no. Similarly, when Congress established political action committees as a legitimate and needed mechanism for unions, corporations, and other groups to contribute to campaigns, did it intend that these entities could nevertheless also make unlimited expenditures for political attack ads as long as certain words were avoided and some reference, however flimsy, was made to an issue? Again, the answer to this question is obviously no, and history bears out this conclusion. 
Go back to the early 1980s when soft money was used only for party overhead and organization expenses, and you will find that contributions totaled only a few million dollars. By contrast, in the last election cycle, when soft money took on its current role, these contributions exceeded $250 million. 
Bogus issue ads were such a small element in the past, that it is impossible to find reliable estimates on the amounts expended on them. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case, and these expenditures have now become worthy of study. The most prominent of these studies estimates that as much as $150 million was spent on bogus issue ads in 1995 and 1996. 
Mr. President, simple logic also shows that soft money, as it is currently used, and bogus issue ads could not have been intended by those who drafted our election laws. There would have been little purpose in limiting contributions to candidates if unlimited money could be given to parties to run ads effectively promoting those candidates. There would have been little purpose in placing monetary limits on contributions to and by PACs, as well as subjecting them to reporting requirements, if the entities for which they were designed could avoid all of that by simply running issue ads. 
Mr. President, some may still ask whether any of this matters. Why should we be concerned if the campaign contribution limits have been rendered a sham by unlimited soft-money donations? Why should we care if the PAC safeguards have been eviscerated by bogus issue ads? 
Starting with soft money, one need only consider the situation of the Hudson Band of Chippewa Indians, an impoverished tribe in the State of Wisconsin. Mr. President, this tribe has every reason to believe and every reason to suspect that the denial of their casino application was driven by the expectation of large soft-money donations by the wealthy tribes who opposed them. 
Allowing such unlimited contributions subverts the proper operation of government or at least creates the appearance that it has been subverted. It is a sign of how extensive the corrupting effect has become that even Native Americans believe they must play the soft money to participate in our democracy. 
The situation with bogus issue ads is not better. That practice undermines the two major objectives of our election laws, namely, placing limits on contributions and disclosing the identity of those making the contributions. Without such disclosure, we lose accountability. A recent study found that as accountability in political communications declines, levels of misinformation and deceit rise. Thus, it is no surprise that bogus issue ads almost always carry a negative message, something which all in this body purport to decry. The question is--are we willing to do something about it? 
In my view, it is imperative that we do something real about these problems. Mr. President, I spent much of my first year as a Member of this body listening to endless hours of testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee about the campaign finance practices in the 1996 elections. While reasonable people can disagree on the solutions, those hearings demonstrated beyond any doubt that the current system is in shambles precisely as a result of the loopholes I have described. 
Mr. President, let me briefly comment on the argument that S. 25 would violate the first amendment. I personally do not believe that to be the case, but more important, there are scores of constitutional scholars who support that conclusion. But the reality is that we can play the game of dueling law professors forever, and it will not resolve the issue. 
We are dealing with an area of great uncertainty. Indeed, in the seminal case of Buckley v. Valeo, a majority of the Supreme Court Justices could not agree on a single opinion. On the subject of what constitutes issue advocacy, Federal Courts of Appeals have handed down conflicting decisions. Thus, no member of this body can say with certainty how the Supreme Court will decide the issue. Our role is to craft election laws that strengthen our democracy, knowing that the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court alone will ultimately determine the constitutionality of our actions. 
It is also essential to eliminate two myths about this bill. It will not stop any American, whether acting as an individual or as part of a group, from running ads advocating for or against a position on any issue. It will also not stop any American, whether acting as an individual or as part of a group, from advocating for or against the election of a candidate, as long as the contribution limits and reporting requirements of our election laws are satisfied. Statements to the contrary are false, and their constant repetition does not make them true. 
Let me close, Mr. President, by returning to my original point. When I ran for a seat in this body, I advocated a major overhaul in our campaign finance laws. Regrettably, that goal must await another day. The challenge before us today is far more modest. Are we prepared to close loopholes that subvert the intent of the election laws that we enacted more than two decades ago? Are we willing to restore to the American people the campaign finance system that rightfully belongs to them? 
I sincerely hope, Mr. President, that at the end of this debate, the answer will be yes and that the Senate will take an initial step on the road to restoring public trust in government. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as the Congress grapples with the problem of maintaining the solvency of the Medicare program and with proposals to expand Medicare coverage, we must not overlook a critical problem that threatens the financial integrity of this vital social program, which provides health care services to 38 million older and disabled Americans. I am talking, Mr. President, about the problem of waste, fraud and abuse in this program. 
The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, has undertaken an extensive investigation into Medicare fraud. 
At our first hearing last summer, we learned from the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services that an astounding $23 billion a year is lost to waste, fraud, abuse and other improper payments. 
In more recent hearings, Mr. President, we discovered that career criminals, with absolutely no background in health care, were able to be certified as Medicare providers and enter the system for the sole purpose of ripping it off. 
For example, one case that the subcommittee investigated involved a totally fictitious durable medical equipment company that was located in the middle of the runway of the Miami International Airport, if it had in fact existed. 
I am not talking here, Mr. President, about legitimate providers or innocent mistakes or honest billing errors. I am talking about outright fraud. We need to do a better job of screening providers and controlling their entry into the Medicare system. 
Mr. President, the vast majority of health care professionals are dedicated and caring individuals who deliver vital services to millions of Americans across the country. They are as appalled by this kind of fraud as any of us. 
Recently, I met with the members of the Home Care Alliance of Maine concerning the issue of fraud in the health care industry. The Home Care Alliance of Maine has a longstanding commitment to ensuring the highest quality home health care in the State of Maine. It has adopted a policy of zero tolerance on fraud and abuse in the home health industry. Its members recognize that unscrupulous home health providers not only tarnish the reputation of legitimate health care professionals, but that these unscrupulous individuals jeopardize the very availability of Medicare.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, Senators Jeffords and Enzi in introducing the Preventing Addiction to Smoking Among Teens Act. 
Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 400,000 deaths a year and more than $50 billion in health care costs. Clearly the single most effective thing we can do to improve our Nation's health and control health care costs is to stop smoking. 
While recent headlines detailing the settlement of multimillion dollar lawsuits against the tobacco industry might delude us into thinking that we are winning the war against tobacco, the facts tell a far different story. Despite extensive public health campaigns linking smoking to heart disease and cancer, smoking rates are actually going up, particularly among our young people. Tragically, addiction is increasingly a `teen-onset' disease: in fact, Mr. President, 90 percent of all smokers began smoking before age 21, 
What is particularly alarming is that children, especially girls, are smoking at younger and younger ages. Smoking is at a 19-year high among high school seniors and has increased over 35 percent among eighth graders and 43 percent among tenth graders over the last 7 years. 
Moreover, of the 3,000 teens who enter the ranks of `regular smokers' every day, one-third will die tobacco-related deaths. Mr. President, I am very proud of many of the accomplishments and achievements of my great State of Maine, but there is one area where we do need to do much, much better. The sad fact is that my State of Maine has the dubious distinction of having the highest smoking rate among people age 18 to 34 in the entire United States. In Maine, almost 40 percent of high school students smoke. They purchase 1.4 million packs of cigarettes illegally each year. If this trend continues, more than 31,000 young people in Maine currently under the age of 18 will die prematurely from tobacco-related diseases. If we are to put an end to this tragic yet preventable epidemic, we must accelerate our efforts not only to help more smokers to quit, but also to discourage young people from ever lighting up in the first place. 
The Preventing Addiction to Smoking Among Teens Act, which we are introducing today, adopts a comprehensive approach to prevent teens from smoking and builds upon and improves the public health components of the tobacco settlement announced last summer. It is not designed to deal with every question and every issue raised by the settlement. Rather, it focuses on what I believe should be the prime goal of any tobacco settlement, and that is to reduce teen smoking. 
Among its provisions, this legislation gives clear and comprehensive authority to the FDA to regulate tobacco products and their components. The tobacco industry will have to turn over all--all--of its documents to the FDA related to cigarette research and health, and the FDA will be able to require the companies to reduce or to eliminate harmful ingredients or to require safer technological improvements through informal rulemaking. Moreover, after 10 years, the FDA could can propose an outright ban on cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products. However, should such a prohibition be required or undertaken, it would require congressional approval. I think that is appropriate. I think that a decision of that magnitude should come back to Congress. 
In my judgment, these provisions represent a marked improvement over last summer's proposed tobacco settlement. The settlement has been criticized for requiring the Food and Drug Administration to go through an arduous formal rulemaking process. Moreoever, unlike the tobacco settlement, our bill does not require the FDA to prove the absence of a black market--which critics have rightly pointed out would be impossible--in order to regulate a product. Finally, to provide the resources necessary for their expanded regulatory powers, the bill requires the FDA to assess a `user fee' of $100 million annually on all manufacturers selling FDA-regulated tobacco products in the United States. 
The bill also incorporates very important recommendations on combating teenage smoking. It calls for strong warning labels. It calls for a ban on vending machine sales that make tobacco products so available to teenagers, it would ban outdoor advertising and the brand-name sponsorship of sporting events, and it would prohibit the use of images like Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man. 
It also, Mr. President, holds the tobacco companies accountable by imposing stiff financial penalties if the smoking rate among children does not decline by 30 percent in 5 years, 50 percent in 7 years, and 60 percent in 10 years. Moreover, under our bill, there is no cap on penalties, and the price goes up the more the companies miss the targets. These are very important, tough new improvements over the proposed settlement. 
Our bill incorporates strong measures to ensure that restrictions on youth access to tobacco products are tough and enforceable. It promotes the development of State and community action programs designed to educate the public on addiction and the hazards of tobacco use and to promote the prevention and the cessation of cigarette smoking. 
It calls for a national public education campaign to deglamorize the use of tobacco products and to discourage young kids from smoking. And finally, it calls for a comprehensive tobacco related research program to study the nature of addiction, the effects of nicotine on the body, and how to change behavior, particularly that of children and teens. 
Mr. President, I believe that the legislation we are introducing today can serve as a basis for broad, bipartisan support to deal with the public health issues that should serve as the foundation for any national health policy in this area. 
I look forward to working with Chairman Jeffords, Senator Enzi, and my other colleagues on the Labor Committee as Congress deals with this important issue.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, to describe just some of what the people of Maine have experienced in recent weeks, namely, the worst natural disaster in our State's history. The `Ice Storm of the Century,' as we refer to it in Maine, began innocently enough with a light rain on Wednesday, January 7. By the time it let up 4 days later, however, the storm had encased the State in a layer of ice up to 10 inches thick and left well over $100 million in damages in its wake. 
When all we need to do to restore power is to flip a switch in our fuse boxes, it is very easy to take for granted just how essential power is to every aspect of our lives. Electricity allows us to cook our meals, heat our homes, and communicate with our neighbors and our friends. From the second we wake up in the morning, usually from the buzz of an electric alarm clock, power plays an integral role in our daily lives. Think for a moment of everything that you are able to do today so far because of power. Then just imagine how you would cope without power for 10 days or even longer as many Maine residents had to do. This ice storm was the single most devastating natural disaster to hit Maine in recorded history. Over 800,000--that is approximately 7 out of 10--of our residents lost power for at least some part of the storm, some for as long as 2 weeks or even longer. 
As you can see from these pictures, Mr. President, power lines, telephone poles and trees were snapped in two by the massive onslaught of ice. This is a picture that appeared in the Bangor Daily News of power lines and of poles, telephone poles, and as you can see the tops of them have been sheared off by the massive weight of the ice. 
Mr. President, I grew up in northern Maine. I am very used to mighty winter storms but never, never in my life, have I experienced a storm like this one. As I looked out from the window of my home in Bangor, limbs from my favorite maple tree in the front yard came crashing down on my roof and against the picture window in my living room. Transformers lit up the night with blue sparks as ice brought them tumbling down as well. And I was much more fortunate than many Maine residents. Many businesses were forced to close due to the lack of power. People took to placing signs in the snow with arrows pointing to their homes reading `No Phone No Power.' Even the National Weather Service located in Gray, ME, lost power for over a week and had to rely on a not-so-reliable generator to track the latest weather developments and to help keep Mainers safe and informed. 
These pictures of a twig and a tiny blade of grass covered with 2 inches of ice were taken on the lawn adjacent to the National Weather Service office. As you can see, telephone poles were snapped in two, trees were coated by ice. 
Mr. President, this is literally a blade of grass. We have a closeup that I am going to show you next on this. 
This shows you just how amazing the ice was from this storm. A single blade of grass is photographed here encased with ice. 
Adding insult to injury, on Saturday, January 25, just as Mainers had begun to return to life as usual, a second ice storm hit, knocking out power to 165,000 Mainers and crippling the electric grid in a region that had managed to come through the first storm relatively unscathed. 
By all accounts, the worst of natural disasters brought out the best in Mainers. Volunteers flocked to shelters to lend a hand and to help serve meals. The State's television stations joined forces to raise money for the Red Cross, and our radio stations and newspapers provided practical tips and encouragement to help keep up the spirits of Mainers during our worst natural disaster. Heartwarming stories of people with little or nothing giving all that they could were commonplace during this tragedy. For 10 straight days, for example, one man opened his home to his neighbors every single night, housing the elderly and infants in his town and helping to remove the heavy branches from roads and from his neighbors' driveways. 
On a personal note, when I ran out of wood after my fourth day without power, a neighbor quickly came to the rescue to help keep my pipes from freezing. Acts of kindness like this one exhibited by my neighbor were repeated over and over again in countless communities throughout the State. One in particular touched me deeply. 
When I was visiting the Red Cross shelter in Bangor at the Air National Guard base, I talked with an elderly woman in a wheelchair who had been forced to leave her home because of the storm. She was obviously a victim of a stroke and was unable to move much of her right side. In addition, it was obvious that she was a person of very modest means. Nevertheless, she said to me, `Could you help me by reaching into my pocketbook. I have $2 there that I would like to donate to the Red Cross.' 
Mr. President, that is the kind of spirit, of generosity and kindness that characterizes Maine people. Even in her dire situation, this woman was able to think of people less fortunate than herself. That spirit of kindness and generosity helped us to survive the `Ice Storm of the Century.' 
Unfortunately, while kindness and good will and generosity and a sense of community helped us to get through the worst of the storm, they alone cannot complete the recovery. 
Mainers experienced serious financial and property losses as a result of the storm. Early estimates put the damages to homes, businesses, utilities and public property at well over $100 million, and it is still growing. The estimated cost of repairs to Maine's power grid alone is a staggering $70 million, and that is money the ratepayers of Maine will have to bear unless there is assistance forthcoming from the Federal Government. 
However, simply attaching a dollar amount to the damage fails to provide a true picture of the devastation experienced by virtually the entire State of Maine. To give you a more vivid idea of the destruction of the ice storm of 1998, I want to share some statistics with my colleagues. 
During this ice storm, 7 out of 10 Mainers lost power, some for as long as 14 days; schools across the southern and central portion of the State closed for many days, some for over 2 weeks; all of Maine's 16 counties were declared Federal disaster areas; at just one hospital in central Maine, more than 80 people were treated for carbon monoxide poisoning, 4 people, unfortunately, died of carbon monoxide poisoning; thousands of families were forced into more than 100 emergency shelters across the State, hundreds of thousands of others spent the night with their families, with family members, neighbors or friends; more than 11 million acres of Maine's forest lands--that is more than half of the State's total--were damaged by the storm. Of this total more than 3 million acres are classified as severely damaged; 1,200 utility crews from as far away as Nova Scotia to North Carolina were sent to Maine to help restore power lines. We are very grateful for that assistance; our telephone company, Bell Atlantic, dispatched 625 fieldworkers, several of whom were on loan from 
other States; in a remarkable development, the Department of Defense actually airlifted bucket trucks and power crews to help us with the repairs; manufacturers of electric parts from as far away as Alabama worked overtime for 10 days to help meet our power company's needs; 3 million feet of electrical cable were irreparably damaged and nearly 3,000 utility poles had to be replaced. Think of how sturdy a utility pole is. We lost 3,000 of them during this storm. 
Even after the debris has been removed and our electric infrastructure has been repaired, much of Maine's natural resources based economy will take years to recover. Dairy farmers, maple syrup producers, apple growers, and our forestry industry were particularly hard hit. In addition, because of the countless downed trees and limbs, some of the 11 million acres of damaged forest lands will remain vulnerable to fire and to insect attacks for years to come. Neighbors, Government agencies and nonprofit organizations rallied to the support of the hundreds of thousands of Mainers displaced by the ice storm, but it will take a strong commitment from the Federal Government for Mainers to truly complete the process of putting their homes, their bases and their communities back together. 
Vice President Gore's tour of the hardest-hit areas and the prompt assistance of FEMA, HUD and SBA demonstrate the Federal Government's concern for Mainers and their commitment to recovery efforts. But additional help is needed. So as we enjoy the comfortable spring-like temperatures in Washington, DC, I urge my colleagues not to forget the Mainers buried in ice and snow. I hope that my colleagues will remember these statistics and the photographs that the senior Senator from Maine and I have shown you today in the coming weeks as we join with other members of the Maine delegation in asking for my colleagues' assistance through a supplemental appropriation for disaster relief. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleagues as one of the original cosponsors of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998. The Rehabilitation Act, originally adopted almost 80 years ago, has developed during succeeding years into one of this country's most important efforts assisting disabled persons in achieving their potentials for employment. 
This law authorizes programs helping persons with disabilities attain their full employment potential as self-supporting, contributing members of society. It provides supported employment services for persons who cannot work independently and offers the services disabled persons need to lead independent lives even if an individual is not capable of working. Through the Rehabilitation Act, federal-state programs provide comprehensive services that help persons with physical and mental disabilities become employable, achieve independence, and participate more fully in society. 
The Rehabilitation Amendments of 1998, which we are introducing today, reaffirm the commitment of the federal government to its disabled citizens and continues the progress we have seen in previous reauthorizations. This bill advances Federal-State rehabilitation efforts in numerous ways. This morning I want to mention three of the changes I believe are the most significant: first, the linking of vocational rehabilitation services to other workforce investment programs; second, the authorization of core services to individuals not eligible for services under an order of selection; and third, the simplification of access to vocational rehabilitation services. 
This bill, which will be incorporated into the S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act, will be functionally linked to the state workforce, job training, and vocational and adult education systems authorized by S. 1186. The Rehabilitation Act will thereby become part of the effort by Congress to replace a fragmented array of programs with an integrated federal system of workforce development without sacrificing the integrity and effectiveness of the vocational rehabilitation program. This process is already underway in Maine through the Maine Department of Labor's one stop career centers. This legislation will make it easier for Maine and other states to create a seamless system of employment assistance for our disabled citizens. 
The second improvement is the authorization of core services to all eligible disabled persons. Because the Rehabilitation Act requires the states to serve the most severely disabled individuals, large numbers of individuals with lesser disabilities have been cut off from services. The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 will permit a state to provide core services to those individuals who are not eligible for full services under the state's criteria for order of selection. Under this provision of the law the states may provide individualized counseling and guidance, individualized vocational exploration, supervised job placement referrals, and assistance obtaining reasonable accommodations even if the individual does not qualify for actual rehabilitation services. This will extend important and highly effective services to a large, deserving population and should greatly enhance these individuals' success in obtaining employment. 
A third advance is the simplification of the procedures by which eligibility for rehabilitation is established. Under these amendments, individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Income are presumed to be eligible for services providing they intend to seek employment and have an impediment to employment caused by their disability. 
In addition to these significant changes that directly affect the clients of the vocational rehabilitation program, this act makes important changes that will make the administration of the vocational rehabilitation program more efficient and reduce a state's administrative burden. One example of this is the coordination of a states vocational rehabilitation plan with the submission of the other job training plans submitted under the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. This will help to eliminate duplicative provisions, submissions and reports. 
Another is the requirement for cooperation and collaboration through cooperative agreements among the state's vocational rehabilitation agency and other components of a state's workforce investment system. While these agreements will be most visible as they affect access and delivery of services, they will also bring about coordination of information and financial management systems leading to simplified and improved management of a state's job training efforts. 
I am proud to cosponsor the reauthorization of an act which has helped so many disabled individuals achieve employment and independent lives.

 Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, 1998 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. On January 28, 1948, the Senate adopted a resolution converting the Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program (better known as the `Truman Committee' for its first chairman, Missouri Senator Harry Truman) into a permanent subcommittee. The special committee looked into charges of waste and abuse in defense contracting during the Second World War. After its first chairman resigned to become Vice President and then President of the United States, the Committee continued to investigate fraud and corruption in the postwar years. Its many successes convinced the Senate of the need to retain an ongoing mechanism to combat wrongdoing and to keep government honest. Today, we celebrate a half century of these endeavors. 
As Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I wish to pay tribute to all of the Senators who have served on the Subcommittee, and to offer a brief survey of the highlights of the Subcommittee's activities over the years. 
Senator Ralph Owen Brewster of Maine chaired the `Truman Committee' during the Republican Eightieth Congress, but when the Senate transferred the functions of the special committee to the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments--a precursor of Governmental Affairs Committee--Senator Brewster was not a member of that committee and could not chair the new subcommittee. 
The Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Branch already had a subcommittee to Investigate Surplus Property Disposal, chaired by Michigan Senator Homer Ferguson. Senator Ferguson, a former judge, had also been a member of the Truman Committee, and had occasionally served as its acting chairman. Assuming the leadership of the new subcommittee, which was to be called the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Ferguson inherited the special committee's authority, functions, and powers. He merged its staff members with those from his subcommittee to Investigate Surplus Property Disposal. Notably, he retained the Truman Committee's chief counsel William Rogers (who later served as Secretary of State) and its chief clerk, Ruth Young Watt (a Maine native who served as chief clerk from the Subcommittee's beginning until her retirement in 1979). While technically reduced to a Subcommittee of a standing committee, the Permanent Subcommittee exercised authority almost as a separate entity, selecting its own staff and determining its own investigatory agenda. 
Senator Homer Ferguson's Chairmanship ended with the election of 1948, which changed the Senate's majority and made Senator Clyde Hoey, a North Carolina Democrat, Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The last U.S. Senator to wear a long frock coat and wing-tipped collar, Mr. Hoey was a distinguished southern gentleman of the old school. During his leadership, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations won national attention for its investigation of the `five percenters,' Washington lobbyists who charged their clients five percent of the profits from any federal contracts they obtained for them. The `five percenters' investigation raised allegations of bribery and influence-peddling that reached right into the White House and implicated some members of President Truman's staff. 
When Republicans regained the Senate's majority in 1953, at the beginning of the Eisenhower administration, Wisconsin's junior Senator, Joseph R. McCarthy, took over as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee. Two years earlier, as Ranking Minority Member, Senator McCarthy had removed from the Committee another Republican Senator, Margaret Chase Smith of Maine. Senator Smith had issued a `Declaration of Conscience' against those who made unfounded charges and used character assassination against their political opponents. Although Senator Smith had not named a specific offender, her remarks were universally recognized as criticism of Senator McCarthy's accusations that Communists had infiltrated the State Department and other government agencies. Senator McCarthy retaliated by eliminating Senator Smith from his Subcommittee and replacing her with the newly elected senator from California, Richard M. Nixon. 
When Senator McCarthy became Subcommittee Chairman, he staged a series of highly publicized anti-communist investigations, culminating in an inquiry into communism in the U.S. Army, which became known as the Army-McCarthy hearings. During the latter portion of these hearings, in which the Committee examined the Wisconsin Senator's attacks on the army, Senator McCarthy recused himself, and South Dakota Senator Karl Mundt served as Acting Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Gavel-to-gavel television coverage of the hearings raised public concern about Senator McCarthy's treatment of witnesses and his irresponsible use of evidence. In December of 1954, the Senate censured Senator McCarthy for unbecoming conduct, and the following year the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations adopted new rules of procedure that better protected the rights of witnesses. These actions vindicated the courageous stand of Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith. 
In 1955, Senator John McClellan of Arkansas began eighteen years of service as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Senator McClellan appointed the young Robert F. Kennedy as the Subcommittee's Chief Counsel. That same year, Members of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations were joined by Members of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee on a special committee to investigate labor racketeering. Chaired by Senator McClellan and staffed by Robert Kennedy and other staff members of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the special committee directed much of its attention to criminal influence over the Teamsters Union, calling Teamsters' leaders Dave Beck and Jimmy Hoffa to testify. The televised hearings of the special committee introduced Senators Barry Goldwater and John F. Kennedy to the nation, and led to passage of the Landrum-Griffin Labor Act. 
After the special committee completed its work, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations continued to investigate organized crime. In 1962, the Subcommittee held hearings in which Joseph Valachi outlined the activities of La Cosa Nostra, or the Mafia. Robert Kennedy, by then Attorney General, used this information to prosecute prominent mob leaders and their accomplices. The investigations also led to passage of major legislation against organized crime, most notably the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) provision of the Crime Control Act of 1970. Under Chairman McClellan, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations also investigated fraud in the purchase of military uniforms, corruption in the Department of Agriculture's grain storage program, securities frauds, and civil disorders and acts of terrorism. From 1962 to 1970, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations conducted an extensive probe of political interference in the awarding of government contracts for the TFX (`tactical fighter, experimental'). In 1968, the Subcommittee also looked into charges of corruption in U.S. servicemen's clubs in Vietnam and elsewhere around the world. 
Senator Henry `Scoop' Jackson, a Democrat from Washington, replaced Senator McClellan as Chair of the Permanent Subcommittee in 1973. Senator Jackson continued most of the Subcommittee staff but added Howard Feldman as Chief Counsel. During these years, Chief Clerk Ruth Young Watt noted that the Subcommittee's Ranking Minority Member, Senator Charles Percy, an Illinois Republican, was even more active on the Committee than was the Chairman, who was balancing his Chairmanship of the Interior Committee and his active role on the Armed Services Committee. 
It had not been uncommon in the Subcommittee's history for the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member to work together closely despite their partisan differences, but Senator Percy was unusually active in the minority--even chairing one investigation of the hearing aid industry. Senator Percy continued to work in tandem with Senator Sam Nunn, who succeeded Senator Jackson as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in 1979. As Chairman, Senator Nunn continued the Subcommittee's investigations into the role of organized crime in labor-management relations and also investigated pension frauds. 
The regular reversals of political fortunes in the 1980s and 1990s saw Georgia Democrat Sam Nunn alternate the Chairmanship with Delaware Republican William Roth. Senator Nunn Chaired the Subcommittee from 1979 to 1980 and again from 1987 to 1995. Senator Roth served as Chair from 1981 to 1986, and again from 1995 to 1996. Senator Roth led a wide range of investigations into commodity investment fraud, offshore banking schemes, money laundering, airline safety, child pornography, and computer security. Senator Nunn pursued federal drug policy, the global spread of chemical and biological weapons, abuses in the federal student aid programs, and health care fraud. Senator Nunn also appointed the first woman counsel, Eleanore Hill, who served as Chief Counsel to the Minority from 1982 to 1986 and then as Chief Counsel from 1987 to 1995. Ms. Hill is now the Inspector General at the Department of Defense. 
In January 1997, I became the first freshman and woman to Chair the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and I appointed Timothy Shea as Chief Counsel. During the first session of the 105th Congress, the Subcommittee held hearings into Medicare fraud and penny stock fraud, as well as an oversight review of the Office of the Inspector General at the Treasury Department that led to the resignation of the Inspector General. 
Now we have reached the Subcommittee's fiftieth anniversary, which marks another significant milestone. Unlike most standing committees of the Senate, whose previously unpublished records open for scholarly research after a period of twenty years has elapsed, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, as an investigatory body, may close its records for fifty years to protect personal privacy and the investigatory process. Over the past half century, scholars have studied and written about many of the Subcommittee's investigations by using its voluminous public hearings, newspaper accounts, oral histories, and the personal papers of the Senators who served on the Subcommittee, but they have also expressed keen interest in examining the Subcommittee's own historical records. With this fiftieth anniversary, the Subcommittee's earliest records, housed in the Center for Legislative Archives at the National Archives and Records Administration, will begin to open seriatim. The records of our predecessor committee--the Truman Committee--were opened by Senator Nunn in 1980. I trust that the new scholarship that emerges from these records will further national awareness of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations' role and its numerous accomplishments. 
The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations does not intend to rest on its historical laurels. As Chair, I pledge a continuation of the Subcommittee's mission of vigilant exposure of government malfeasance, social and economic wrongdoing, and serious violations of the public trust. We will focus on problems that affect the American people in their daily lives so that our work will help and protect the people of Maine and Americans across the nation.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words in honor of one of our Nation's most legendary Senators and one of Maine's most beloved public figures: Senator Margaret Chase Smith. 
December 14 marks the 100th anniversary of Senator Smith's birth. Since we will not be in session on the 14th, I would like to take the opportunity to speak in honor of her centennial today. 
Margaret Chase Smith has the distinction of being the first woman elected in her own right to both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. She served in the Senate from 1949 to 1972--the entire time that I was growing up in Maine. Throughout her tenure in Congress, she served as a great source of pride and inspiration for countless people throughout Maine and the Nation. 
Mr. President, I am one of those fortunate people whose life was touched personally by Senator Margaret Chase Smith. So it is with a great deal of gratitude and admiration that I speak about her legacy today in celebration of her centennial. 
Mr. President, when I was just 18 years old, a high school senior from Caribou, ME, Senator Margaret Chase Smith encouraged me to pursue a career in public service. Now I serve in the U.S. Senate, holding her very seat. Her example of moderation, independence and integrity continues to guide me every day as I seek to represent the people of Maine. 
Walking through the Halls of the Senate, I am frequently reminded of my first significant encounter with Senator Smith. 
In January 1971, I left my hometown of Caribou, ME, to spend a week here in Washington, DC. I was one of 100 high school students from around the Nation participating in the U.S. Senate Youth Program. The program consisted of VIP tours of Washington, formal dinners, and numerous high-profile speakers ranging from Supreme Court Justices to top White House officials. The highlight of my week, however, was the afternoon that we visited our respective Senators. 
When I arrived at Senator Smith's office, I was immediately ushered into her personal suite. Her office was bustling with activity, and yet it had a stately and serene quality. Senator Smith looked perfectly at home in the setting as the only woman in the Senate. Her green office suited her well and, of course, reminded me of the State of Maine. She shook my hand and invited me to sit down, and seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say. 
Much to my amazement, Mr. President, instead of just quickly posing with me for a picture, Senator Smith spent nearly 2 hours talking to me about her years in Congress. She stressed the importance of public service and the difference that one person could make. We talked about her opposition to McCarthyism and the necessity of standing tall for one's principles no matter what the cost. 
As I was leaving, she handed me a copy of her famous `Declaration of Conscience' speech to take with me. I was struck by her presence and I knew that she was a woman of enormous strength and integrity. I was so proud that she was my Senator. 
As I bid her farewell, I could not keep the smile 
from stretching across my face nor the dreams from racing through my mind. To me, Senator Smith was living proof that women, even those of us from small rural towns in Maine, could accomplish anything upon which we set our sights. 
I have since learned that my early impressions of Senator Smith are shared by thousands of others throughout our State and throughout the Nation whose lives she touched. But we in Maine are particularly fortunate to have had her as a role model and as our Senator. 
As one Congresswoman recently said to me, `You know, it was much harder for women to get elected in my State because we didn't have Margaret Chase Smith.' 
Senator Smith's 32 years of leadership epitomized the type of thoughtful, independent representation that sets a standard for public service. 
As I campaigned throughout Maine for the Senate last year, it was apparent to me that the name `Margaret Chase Smith' strikes a resounding chord with the citizens of my State. From Kittery to Calais to Fort Kent, people recognize and honor her name and her legacy as synonymous with thoughtful, independent, and honest representation. This above all else, Mr. President, is the legacy of Senator Smith and the tradition which those of us who are honored to follow in her footsteps strive to uphold. 
While Senator Smith served as an inspiration to me as a young girl and as a beacon of strength during my two statewide campaigns, it was not until I began my service in the Senate that I fully understood her legacy and the extraordinary courage she exhibited throughout her years in Congress. 
Margaret Chase Smith is perhaps best remembered for her principled and unabashed stance against Senator Joe McCarthy. Because the courageous stand that she took against McCarthyism is so familiar to all of us today--it seems to be so obviously the right thing to do--we sometimes forget and underestimate the risks that she took and the hardships she endured in this fight. From my new perspective as a U.S. Senator, I must say that the courage that Senator Smith showed during the McCarthy era is truly remarkable. 
Over the course of the past several months, I have had many occasions to reflect upon another of Senator Smith's principled positions. 
As a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have been involved in investigating the fundraising abuses of the 1996 Presidential election campaigns. These hearings have examined some of the most deplorable and certainly most excessive fundraising practices in our Nation's history, such as operating the Lincoln Bedroom like a hotel, phony issue ads, fundraising coffees in the Oval Office and soft money contributions of staggering sums and questionable origins. 
In the 24 years since Senator Smith left office, fundraising has become an all-consuming and self-propelling institution. It is difficult for those of us who are in office today to remember that Senator Smith waged so many successful political campaigns without soliciting a single contribution. How we envy her. She believed that big money had the potential to be a corrupting influence in the system, and she has certainly been proven right. 
Throughout this past year--my first in the Senate--I have been reminded of one of Senator Margaret Chase Smith's most famous statements time and again. She once said that there is a `difference between the principle of compromise and the compromise of principle.' This sentiment has guided me through many tough negotiations and heated debates where it is sometimes difficult to know when it is best to be stalwart for the sake of principle and when it is time to seek common ground in the name of action. 
Compromising one's principles is wrong; but the principle of compromise, on the other hand, is the essence of a healthy democracy. Senator Smith's wisdom has helped me many times in reaching decisions on thorny issues. 
Mr. President, 25 years after my first encounter with Senator Smith, I fulfilled the dream that she fostered in me back in 1971, and was elected to her seat in the U.S. Senate. Just as Senator Smith was the first woman elected in her own right to both the House of Representatives and the Senate, upon my election, Maine became the first State in the Nation to be represented and to elect two Republican women Senators. 
This distinction is a fitting tribute and testament to the legacy of Margaret Chase Smith. If not for her 32 years of congressional service, many doors to and within the Capitol might still be closed to women today. 
In all of history, Mr. President, there have only been 15 women elected to the U.S. Senate in their own right, and 3 of us have been from the great State of Maine. 
Thanks to Senator Smith's decades of selfless service, principled leadership and pioneering efforts, the people of Maine know that leadership is not about gender; it is about decency and tenacity and service and integrity. Margaret Chase Smith embodied all of these traits, and so much more. 
Today, I honor her for paving the way for me, and countless others, and for establishing the thoughtful and independent approach to public service that Mainers have come to expect from their elected officials. 
I thank the Chair. And I also thank the Chair for presiding for me so that I could pay tribute on the 100th anniversary of the great Senator from Maine, Margaret Chase Smith. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in the life of a country, as in the life of an individual, there are times when we must choose between moving forward and standing still. Our trade policy is at just such a crossroads: We must decide whether to help promote freer trade and more open markets or try to preserve the status quo. 
As we confront this issue, we must recognize that the world is changing and that even an economic superpower can do no more than postpone the inevitable. Our resolution of this issue will determine whether the United States continues to move forward on a wave of export-driven growth or risks permitting other economies to leave us behind. I believe it is time to stand behind our commitment to free trade and work to bring other countries into open trading relationships that will mean jobs and prosperity for our citizens in the century ahead. That is why, Mr. President, I have decided to support the fast track legislation. 
In developing my position on this legislation, I have been guided by one overriding consideration - will its enactment improve the lives of the people of Maine? Will it mean more customers for Maine businesses? Will it mean more opportunities for Maine entrepreneurs? And most important, will it mean more jobs for Maine workers? While free trade is not without problems, I firmly believe that the long-term answer to all of these questions is yes. 
International trade is an increasingly critical part of Maine's economy. In 1996, for example, my State exported more than 1.2 billion dollars worth of goods. Considering both the direct and indirect impact, those exports translated into 13,500 Maine jobs. 
But this export-led growth is just the beginning. I believe the people of Maine have the ingenuity, the drive, and the work ethic to flourish in a world of freer trade and more open markets for U.S. goods. From successful retailers like L.L. Bean, to manufacturers like Pratt & Whitney, to financial service companies like UNUM, to high-technology companies like Portland's ABB, to paper mills throughout my State, Maine enterprises have proven that they can compete in a global economy. These companies recognize that much of their future revenue and job growth will come from serving customers beyond our borders. 
This is well understood in Maine. The United Paperworkers International Union has pressed the administration to negotiate reductions in European tariffs to help open foreign markets to the products its members make in Maine and elsewhere and to generate more export-related jobs. As Prof. Charles Colgan of the University of Southern Maine, a noted trade expert, stated in a recent letter to me, `The . . . vote on Fast Track authority for the President to negotiate additional trade agreements is an important vote for Maine. International trade is an increasingly vital part of the Maine economy. . . .' 
Perhaps the clearest reason to support fast-track authority was set forth in a letter from the State of Maine's director of International Trade, who wrote as follows: `I simply feel that our best hopes for long-term economic prosperity here in Maine lie in creating international opportunities for our people, and not in limiting our access to new and emerging economies. However, well-intentioned, restricting our ability to trade will never create new jobs for Maine people.' 
Mr. President, I said earlier that we face the decision of whether to move forward. But in reality, the world will change with or without us, and thus, the real question is not whether we move forward, but whether we move forward wisely. That is the standard against which we should judge our trade policy, and against which we should judge this legislation. To me, this means that our trade strategy must meet three tests. 
First, since some citizens may be temporarily disadvantaged--through no fault of their own--by the changes freer trade can bring, we must assist them to adjust to changed conditions. Second, we must ensure that free trade is genuinely free, for that is what `fair trade' really means: If we do not insist that other countries open their markets to fair competition from U.S. goods, the system will collapse. Third, as we give the President the authority to negotiate trade agreements, we must preserve an appropriate role for Congress in this vital area of national policy. 
After weeks of studying this issue, listening to my constituents, and 
consulting with U.S. trade officials, it has become clear to me that the renewal of fast-track authority meets my three criteria and is very much in the best interests of my country and my State. 
First, while the rising economic tide that comes from free trade ultimately lifts all boats, it may impose costs upon some of our citizens in the short run. For this reason, I was greatly encouraged by the President's promise to expand Trade Adjustment Assistance programs--and to expand them to include not only workers directly affected by trade adjustments but also workers in businesses supplying affected companies. This change should prove particularly beneficial to small businesses in Maine and elsewhere. 
Second, I am pleased to have received assurances from the office of the U.S. Trade Representative that they share some of the important concerns of Maine's citizens with regard to ensuring that trade is really free. More specifically, Ambassador Barshefsky has made clear to me in writing that she regards Canada's bulk easement rules on potato imports to be an unfair trade barrier that must be pursued with the Canadian Government. Ambassador Barshefsky has committed to me that she will begin bilateral talks with the Canadian Government, beginning no later than March 1998. In addition, Ambassador Barshefsky has assured me that she views Canadian potato subsidies as a very serious matter that also must be addressed. Having established open markets as the norm, our trade officials must work--and, I have been assured, are working--to ensure that foreign governments keep their promises. 
Furthermore, I want to emphasize that passage of this legislation will not in any way hinder the ability of an industry to bring challenges under current trade laws against unfair trade practices, such as subsidies provided by foreign governments. Members of the farmed salmon industry in Maine have brought such a case. They seek relief from the adverse effects of dumping and subsidization, and of unequal conditions of competition, which give their Chilean competitors an unfair and illegal advantage. 
It was only after I became satisfied that fast track would not negatively affect the Maine salmon industry or its ability to pursue its legitimate grievances under current law that I decided to support this legislation. As a representative of the salmon industry recently advised me, what is most critical to them is `the preservation of effective remedies under existing law and their vigorous enforcement.' This legislation not only preserves existing remedies but also has as one of its objectives the pursuit of illegal activities by other nations. Thus, it recognizes that free trade is not achieved by the stroke of a pen on an agreement but rather by a commitment to the vigorous enforcement of our trade laws. 
Third, this bill carefully addresses the need to preserve the proper balance of powers and responsibilities within our Government. While it restricts Congress' power to amend the terms of trade agreements, it maintains our right to reject them. Indeed, it goes farther than any prior fast-track legislation to protect Congressional prerogatives. For example, it limits the application of the fast track to agreements which advance specifically enumerated negotiating objectives set out in the bill, which preserves our ultimate authority to set the goals of U.S. trade policy. 
Moreover, the Senate version of the legislation contains more elaborate procedures than ever before to ensure that Congress is consulted at every step as the President negotiates trade agreements. The President must consult with or notify the relevant committees--or Congress as a whole--on at least five different occasions during the process, even before Congress begins drafting an agreement's implementing legislation. These requirements guarantee that at all times we will be fully informed of the progress of ongoing trade talks. 
Most significantly, unlike past fast-track legislation, S. 1269 permits congressional disapproval of a trade agreement long before the stage of final ratification. After the President notifies Congress of his intent to negotiate a specific agreement, the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee may vote to `disapprove' the idea--thus removing it from the fast-track process and making it subject to ordinary amendment. Under this legislation, what Congress gives to the President it may also take away. In short, the bill allows America to move more quickly in a rapidly changing world, while making Congress more of a real partner in the negotiation of trade agreements. 
The United States is one of the principal engines of the world economy in large part because it has long been one of the most open trading economies in the world. Continued progress in global trade liberalization--bringing other countries up to our high standards of market openness--is vital if we are to remain in the global driver's seat in the next century. 
The road to free trade will not be without bumps, but it is a road I believe we must take, for at the end of that road will be a more prosperous Maine, a more prosperous America, and a more prosperous world. For that reason, I intend to vote for the fast-track legislation.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, along with my colleagues Senators Thompson and Bennett, that will require the Department of Justice to pay the legal fees of a former Federal employee, Sheila Heslin, who incurred these expenses as a direct result of the campaign finance investigations conducted by the Congress, the Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Earlier this fall, Ms. Heslin testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee about actions she took while performing her official duties as an employee of the National Security Council. Everyone who observed her testimony was impressed with her honesty and courage in resisting high-level political pressure. Ms. Heslin told us how other governmental and political officials pressured her to approve a request that Roger Tamraz, a major contributor with an unsavory reputation, be allowed to meet with President Clinton. She resisted these overtures in an effort to protect the integrity of the White House and to ensure that our foreign policy was conducted appropriately. Of all the individuals who testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee about the campaign finance problems, Ms. Heslin provided the best example of how career Government officials ought to conduct themselves. She demonstrated courage and a high regard for the proper conduct of U.S. foreign policy. 
Ms. Heslin participated in these proceedings as a witness, not as the subject of any investigation. She has provided important information on events and activities that may well become the subject of prosecution. As a result, Ms. Heslin was forced to retain private counsel to advise her in the various investigations because representation by Government counsel would have presented a clear conflict of interest. 
It is my understanding that the Department of Justice has to date declined to reimburse Ms. Heslin for the legal fees relating to her testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and other similar inquiries. She is now a private citizen with a new baby and without the personal wealth to afford the legal representation her service as a Government employee has required. As an important and fully cooperative witness in these investigations, she has set an example that ought to not be discouraged by denying Government payment for outside legal representation in a case involving appropriate actions taken during her Federal employment. 
Under existing regulations, the Department of Justice normally approves the payment of legal fees for Government employees when `the actions for which representation is requested reasonably appears to have been performed within the scope of the employees's employment' and payment is `in the interest of the United States.' Both requirements have been met in the case Sheila Heslin. 
Moreover, Mr. President, in connection with other investigations, the Department of Justice has paid the legal fees of hundreds of Government employees, some of whom were high-level political appointees. For example, in fiscal year 1996, political appointees at the White House and on the Vice President's staff were reimbursed thousands of dollars in attorneys' fees. To deny the payment of legal fees to Ms. Heslin, who is not suspected of any wrongdoing, while at the same time paying the legal fees of many other Government employees, some of whom were being investigated for possible illegal activities, is simply unfair. 
Earlier this month, I asked the Attorney General to personally address this matter and to reverse the decision denying reimbursement to Ms. Heslin. I am still waiting for Attorney General Reno's response to my letter. 
In the absence of action by the Department of Justice, I am introducing this bill which directs the Attorney General to pay reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Ms. Heslin as a result of the campaign finance investigations. To ensure that such payments are not excessive, it is intended that the amounts be determined in accordance with applicable Justice Department regulations. 
Mr. President, this bill is not only for Sheila Heslin. It is also to send a clear message to every career Government employee who in the future has to choose between succumbing to inappropriate political pressure or doing the right thing. It is also for the American people who are the ultimate beneficiaries when public servants put the interests of the country ahead of the interests of those seeking to buy access and influence for their own narrow purposes. 
Mr. President, it is regrettable that we cannot do more to reward people who follow the high standards of conduct we all espouse. At the very least, we should ensure that the actions of their Government do not penalize them. For that reason, I hope my colleagues will support this measure.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, last week I was pleased to join with my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, in introducing S. 1345, the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act which is intended to improve the way we care for people at the end of their lives. 
Noted health economist Uwe Reinhardt once observed that `Americans are the only people on earth who believe that death is negotiable.' Advancements in medicine, public health, and technology have enabled more and more of us to live longer and healthier lives. However, when medical treatment can no longer promise a continuation of life, patients and their families should not have to fear that the process of dying will be marked by preventable pain, avoidable distress, or care that is inconsistent with their values or wishes. 
The fact is, dying is a universal experience, and it is time to reexamine how we approach death and dying and how we care for people at the end of their lives. Clearly there is more that we can do to relieve suffering, respect personal choice and dignity, and provide opportunities for people to find meaning and comfort at life's conclusion. 
Unfortunately, most Medicare patients and their physicians do not currently discuss death or routinely make advance plans for end-of-life care. As a result, about one-fourth of Medicare funds are now spent on care at the end of life that is geared toward expensive, high-technology interventions, and rescue care. While four out of five Americans say they would prefer to die at home, studies show that almost 80 percent die in institutions where they may be in pain, and where they are subjected to high-technology treatments that merely prolong suffering. 
Moreover, according to a Dartmouth study released earlier this month, where a patient lives has a direct impact on how that patient dies. The study found that the amount of medical treatment Americans receive in their final months varies tremendously in the different parts of the country, and it concluded that the determination of whether or not an older patient dies in the hospital probably has more to do with the supply of hospital beds than the patient's needs or preference. 
The Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act is intended to help us improve the way our health care system serves patients at the end of their lives. Among other provisions, the bill makes a number of changes to the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990 to facilitate appropriate discussions and individual autonomy in making difficult discussions about end-of-life care. For instance, the legislation requires that every Medicare beneficiary receiving care in a hospital or nursing facility be given the opportunity to discuss end-of-life care and the preparation of an advanced directive with an appropriately trained professional within the institution. The legislation also requires that if a patient has an advanced directive, it must be displayed in a prominent place in the medical record so that all the doctors and nurses can clearly see it. 
The legislation will expand access to effective and appropriate pain medications for Medicare beneficiaries at the end of their lives. Severe pain, including breakthrough pain that defies usual methods of pain control, is one of the most debilitating aspects of terminal illness. However, the only pain medication currently covered by Medicare in an outpatient setting is that which is administered by a portable pump. 
It is widely recognized among physicians treating patients with cancer and other life-threatening diseases that self-administered pain medications, including oral drugs and transdermal patches, offer alternatives that are equally effective in controlling pain, more comfortable for the patient, and much less costly than the pump. Therefore, the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act would expand Medicare to cover self-administered pain medications prescribed for the relief of chronic pain in life-threatening diseases or conditions. 
In addition, the legislation authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to study end-of-life issues for Medicare and Medicaid patients and also to develop demonstration projects to develop models for end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries who do not qualify for the hospice benefit, but who still have chronic debilitating and ultimately fatal illnesses. Currently, in order for a Medicare beneficiary to qualify for the hospice benefit, a physician must document that the person has a life expectancy of 6 months or less. With some conditions--like congestive heart failure--it is difficult to project life expectancy with any certainty. However, these patients still need hospice-like services, including advance planning, support services, symptom management, and other services that are not currently available. 
Finally, the legislation establishes a telephone hotline to provide consumer information and advice concerning advance directives, end-of-life issues and medical decision making and directs the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to develop a research agenda for the development of quality measures for end-of-life care.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to announce my intention to join my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, and vote for his motion to table the amendment offered by the distinguished majority leader to the McCain-Feingold campaign reform legislation. 
This has not been an easy decision for me. I strongly support the underlying objective, if not the precise language of Senator Lott's amendment. The principle that America's working men and women should not be required to contribute their hard-earned money to advance the campaign of candidates they do not support is a compelling one. The strong opposition of big labor to this reasonable proposal demonstrates their fear that many of the rank and file union members would not agree to the use of their dues for political purposes. 
But in the final analysis, my decision on this matter must be determined by considerations other than the merits of Senator Lott's amendment. The plain truth is that its adoption will kill campaign finance reform. That is not simply my judgment; it is the judgment of Senator McCain and Senator Feingold who have devoted so much time and energy to further the cause of reform. 
When I ran for the U.S. Senate, I made a clear and unambiguous promise to the people of Maine. I promised that I would fight for campaign finance reform. The people of my State responded by entrusting me to represent them in this body, and whatever other loyalties that I might have, I owe my ultimate allegiance to them. I kept that promise when I cosponsored the McCain-Feingold bill, and I am keeping it now by pledging to vote against what I have concluded is, in fact, a killer amendment. 
I do, however, want to say a few words to my Democratic colleagues. At the end of the day, we will not have campaign finance reform without sacrifices and courage on both sides of the aisle. If Senator Lott's amendment is not defeated, the spotlight will shift to the Democrats. So far, they have had the easy road, able to proclaim their passion for reform, knowing that it faces an uphill battle and confident that they can blame the Republicans if it does not pass. 
But if their response to the Lott amendment is simply to filibuster and not to offer a reasonable compromise on the union dues issue, an already skeptical public will reach the inevitable conclusion that Democrats are not serious about reforming the system. A number of Democrats have urged me to put principle over party, and to them I say, `Your turn may come.' 
Mr. President, a fair campaign finance system is essential to a healthy democracy. While not perfect, the McCain-Feingold bill would give us a fair system. Given the commitment of the people of Maine to fair play, I am confident that my position on this issue not only is right as a matter of principle, but also reflects the values of my home State. 
I want to also take this opportunity to commend Senator McCain and Senator Feingold for their unceasing efforts in this very important fight. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Americans have long been urged by our doctors, our teachers, and our parents to eat at least five servings every day of fruits and vegetables. When we follow this good advice, we assume that the fruits and vegetables that we are consuming are wholesome. Recent reports, however, have raised questions about the safety of imported food products. Our markets are increasingly filled with imported food that may not meet U.S. food safety standards. Thus, American consumers seeking a healthy diet face the unappetizing risk of unknowingly subjecting themselves to tainted imported food. 
As the chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I am conducting an investigation into the safety of food imports. I have asked the General Accounting Office to examine whether or not the Federal Government adequately protects the American people from tainted imported food. We need to know how imports are currently being inspected, what resources are being devoted to food safety and whether the highest risks are being given the highest priority in the inspection process. We should make certain, Mr. President, that our food safety programs are effectively and efficiently managed to safeguard the public's health. 
Recent news reports have shown several instances where tainted imported food has caused serious illnesses. Food safety programs and food safety problems are not limited to beef and poultry, and it is not just food coming from domestic facilities that can cause health problems. 
Imported fruits and vegetables in increasing numbers are causing serious illnesses. In March, over 260 children and teachers from Michigan developed hepatitis after eating frozen strawberries that were imported from Mexico. Those berries were illegally provided to the School Lunch Program, which requires food used to be produced in the United States. Instead, the tainted Mexican berries had been shipped to over 1,500 locations across the country, including my home State of Maine. In another example, over 2,000 people were infected with cyclospora in the last 2 years from eating tainted raspberries from Guatemala, making it the largest outbreak of food-borne disease in recent years. 
Mr. President, I believe Congress must thoroughly examine the safety of imported food products. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service have shared responsibility for the regulation and inspection of imported food. Agriculture officials are responsible primarily for meat and poultry, while the Food and Drug Administration regulates and inspects other food products. Standards in enforcement are thus different, depending on the type of food. In addition, the significant increase in food imports has resulted in a system where consumers cannot be assured of the safety of the food they eat. A New York Times article on September 29 of this year, just this past week, indicates that food imports have doubled since the 1980s, straining the limits of our current inspection system. 
Later this week, President Clinton is expected to announce several initiatives to increase and improve Federal attention to food safety. I welcome the President's increased interest in the safety of imported food products, and when his proposal is transmitted to the Congress, I will closely examine it to determine if it is, in fact, an effective and adequate response to this problem. 
As chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I want to make sure that our current programs are being effectively managed and that both existing and new resources are efficiently administered to promote safe food, especially imported food. 
Mr. President, the safety of food product imports is literally a life-and-death issue for many Americans, especially our elderly and our children. Food safety deserves close attention of the administration and the Congress, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the months ahead as my subcommittee continues its investigation and conducts hearings on this important matter.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity to make much-needed changes in our campaign finance laws by supporting the modified version of the McCain-Feingold legislation. I am pleased, Mr. President, to be a cosponsor of this landmark bill. 
Shortly after becoming President of the United States, one of our former Presidents was asked what his biggest surprise was on assuming office. Without hesitation, he said it was his discovery that things were actually as bad as he had been saying they were during the campaign. 
Mr. President, during my Senate campaign, I told the people of Maine that our Nation's campaign finance system is broken. Since my election, I have spent a great deal of my time questioning witnesses at the hearings held by the Governmental Affairs Committee. Unlike the former President, what I have discovered is not that things are as bad as I had been saying they were; it is that they are much worse. 
The twin loopholes of soft money and bogus issue ads have virtually obliterated our campaign finance laws, leaving us with little more than a pile of legal rubble. We supposedly have restrictions on how much individuals can give to political parties; yet, Yogesh Gandhi is able to contribute $325,000 to the DNC to buy a picture with the President, and Roger Tamraz mockingly tells a committee of the U.S. Senate that next time he will spend $600,000, rather than $300,000, to buy access to the White House. We supposedly prohibit corporations and unions from spending money on political campaigns; yet, the AFL-CIO spends $800,000 in Maine on so-called issue ads which anyone with an ounce of common sense recognized were designed to defeat a candidate for Congress. 
We in this body decry legal loopholes, but we have reserved the largest ones for ourselves. Indeed, these loopholes are more like black holes, and that sucking sound you hear during election years is the whoosh of six-figure soft money donations rushing into party coffers. 
Why should this matter, we are asked by those all too eager to equate freedom of speech with freedom to spend? It should matter because political equality is the essence of democracy, and an electoral system driven by big money is one lacking in political equality. 
Mr. President, this is an issue of great concern to the people of my home State. While there are differences in Maine on how the system should be 
reformed--I, for one, do not believe that meaningful change requires that we make taxpayers underwrite campaigns--there does seem to be a stronger consensus in Maine than elsewhere on the need for reform. 
If my colleagues will indulge me a bit of home State pride, I think the Maine perspective results from old fashioned Down East common sense. Maine people are able to see through the complexities of this debate. They focus on what is at heart a very simple and yet very profound problem. As long as we allow unlimited contributions--whether in the form of hard or soft money--we will not have political equality in this country. 
It is not simply the lack of a level playing field for those seeking public office. What is more important is the lack of a level playing field for those seeking access to their government. 
It strikes me that the Maine attitude may be shaped by the fact that many communities in my State still hold town meetings. I am not talking about the staged, televised town meeting which has become so fashionable of late. I am talking about a rough and tumble meeting held in the town office or the high school gym or the grange hall. Attend one of these sessions and you will observe an element of true democracy: People with more money do not get to speak longer and louder than people with less money. What is true at Maine town meetings is unfortunately not true in Washington. 
Mr. President, let me address a very disquieting aspect of the debate on the McCain-Feingold bill; namely, the misinformation that is being spread about what the bill would do. In that connection, I would emphasize that McCain-Feingold does not bar issue advocacy. I will say that again because the legislation's opponents persist in misstating this point--McCain-Feingold does not, and I emphasize not, bar issue advocacy. 
To explain this aspect of the bill in more detail, and to share with my colleagues an experience that contributed to my becoming a cosponsor, I need to go back to the 1996 race for Maine's First Congressional District in the House of Representatives. In the course of that election, the AFL-CIO spent $800,000 to defeat the Republican candidate. They did this by running a steady barrage of blatantly negative ads. 
Now why am I protesting a national union, using money from its general treasury to run a saturation campaign of negative ads that may well have decided a Maine congressional race? Whatever our objection to such ads, isn't that perfectly legal? The answer is, or at least is supposed to be, no. Current law prohibits a union, as well as a 
corporation, from spending money, other than through a PAC, to influence an election for a Federal office. 
That leads to another obvious question--if current law forbids unions from using non-PAC money to run ads to influence a Federal election, how was the AFL-CIO able to spend $800,000 to defeat a Republican congressional candidate in Maine? Mr. President, that question takes us to the heart of the problem and to the need for McCain-Feingold. 
Unfortunately, some courts have interpreted `expressly advocating' to require that the ad use words such as `vote for' or `vote against' or `elect' or `defeat.' If the ad avoids those magic words and makes at least a passing reference to an issue, as the AFL-CIO did in Maine, those courts concluded that it does not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, and the union may run it. 
Mr. President, the situation I have described has led to the biggest sham in American politics. Nobody in Maine believed that the AFL-CIO's negative ads were for any purpose other than the defeat of a candidate. Indeed, at least one newspaper which endorsed the Democratic candidate blasted the union ads against his opponent. Ads of that nature make an absolute mockery out of the prohibition against unions and corporatings spending money on Federal elections. 
The `express advocacy' provision in McCain-Feingold is designed to do away with this sham. Contrary to what some have said, it would not affect independent ads financed other than by a union or corporation, except to enhance the reporting requirements, which everyone in this body purports to favor. It also would not stop unions and corporations from running true issue ads. 
Mr. President, I would say to my colleagues that if you believe, as I do, that it continues to represent sound public policy to prohibit unions from using their vast general funds to dictate the results of Federal elections, particularly in small States like Maine, then you should support McCain-Feingold. 
Mr. President, let me also take a minute to explain the bright line test for express advocacy that has been the subject of ill-informed criticism during this debate. What that test would provide is that any television ad that clearly identifies a candidate and that is run within 60 days of an election would be deemed express advocacy. 
I view the bright line test as a key provision of McCain-Feingold, and I support its inclusion for two reasons. First, the courts have said that for constitutional purposes, people must clearly know what they can and cannot do, something which the bright line test gives them. 
Second, and contrary to what some opponents of the bill have said, the bright line test lessens the power of the Federal Election Commission. By having a clear standard, rather than one which requires a case-by-case analysis, the regulatory agency has less discretion to determine what the law should be and when actions should be brought. Thus, those who have argued both against the test and against a greater role for the FEC are in reality arguing with themselves. 
Mr. President, this subject is more complex than any of us would like, but behind the complexity is a simple proposition. Current law has given rise to the widespread practice of running bogus issue ads, and that should not be allowed to continue. Those Members of this body who support the prohibition against unions and corporations using their vast resources to dictate the results of Federal elections should vote for McCain-Feingold. Those Members who do not support the prohibition should take the honest road and work for its repeal. The one unacceptable course is to perpetuate a sham that undermines the integrity of our election laws. 
I look forward to debating this issue in the days ahead. 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with a tremendous sense of pride and great pleasure to inform my colleagues that a citizen of the great State of Maine has been elected national commander of the American Legion. 
As many in this Chamber are aware, the American Legion recently held its 79th national convention in Orlando, FL. At the conclusion of that convention, a Maine legionnaire, Anthony Jordan, of Augusta, was elected national commander. 
To be selected by your peers to such a prestigious post is a significant accomplishment. For his home State, for his family, for his American Legion post in Wiscasset, ME, and for the thousands of Maine veterans it is a singular honor. 
Mr. President, the American Legion chose wisely when it selected Mr. Jordan to lead this organization for the next year. Let me just tell you a bit about Mr. Jordan's background. 
Tony Jordan served in the U.S. Army from 1963 to 1965. He joined the American Legion, our Nation's largest veterans organization, in 1971. Mr. Jordan demonstrated an unusual level of personal commitment and leadership in making his commitment to the work of the American Legion, both at the State and the national level. 
For example, he served as post commander in Wiscasset and as vice commander of the American Legion Department of Maine. He also served as chairman of the Legion's national membership and post activities committee. He chaired the Foreign Relations Council and the National Security Commission. 
In addition, Mr. Jordan also contributed to the Legion as a 
member of the National Legislative Commission and as liaison to the National Finance Commission. 
Finance, foreign relations, national security--that is an impressive and diverse range of committee appointments that make him well qualified to head the American Legion. But the Legion also knew that, when it asked Tony Jordan to take charge, this was an important time for the American Legion and for America's veterans. 
Tony Jordan has expressed strong personal sentiments in favor of the constitutional amendment to protect the American flag. Our flag is the symbol for everything for which our Nation stands. Mr. Jordan is standing with those who believe in the integrity of the flag and what it represents--freedom and justice, ideals for which our Nation's veterans risk and, in some cases, gave their lives. 
Mr. Jordan is also outspoken in his support of a GI bill of health, the American Legion's response to the challenges being faced by the Department of Veterans Affairs and veterans across this country as they seek to fulfill the promise we made to ensure that our veterans have access to quality health care. 
These are only a few examples, Mr. President, of what Mr. Jordan has done on behalf of his country and its largest veterans organization. I know my colleagues will agree that the American Legion chose wisely and well when it elected Anthony Jordan of Augusta, ME, as its national commander. I wish him well in the challenging year ahead. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Working Students' Income Protection Act, a bill to increase the number of working students who are eligible for Federal Pell grants. I am pleased to have Senator Snowe, Senator Hollings, and Senator Robb as cosponsors. 
This bill will correct a problem created by the 1992 amendments to the Higher Education Act that unfairly denies aid to hundreds of thousands of deserving students. Let me explain the problem. 
The formula used to determine the eligibility for Federal financial aid includes an income protection allowance, known as an IPA, which enables working students to retain a portion of their earnings to pay their basic living expenses. This allowance is not counted in determining eligibility for student aid. A portion of earnings above the IPA is used to calculate the contributions students can make to their education expenses. As students' incomes rise above the IPA, their eligibility for Federal student aid, especially for Pell grants, declines. 
The 1992 amendments to the Higher Education Act dramatically and drastically lowered the income protection allowances. For single students, financially independent of their families, the IPA was reduced from $6,400 to $3,000. The IPA for working dependent students was lowered from $4,250 to $1,750. As a result, the amount a typical independent student can receive under the Pell Grant Program begins to decline when his or her income exceeds $3,000, and the student becomes completely ineligible at an income level of $10,000. 
Because of this decrease in IPA's, the number of independent students receiving Pell grants declined from over a million in 1992 to about 750,000 in 1993--a loss of over a quarter of a million grants to independent working students. 
This change has three unfortunate consequences: 
First, many nontraditional students are not able to pursue post-secondary education. Typically these are older individuals with jobs who are attempting to improve their skills. Because the IPA is not enough to meet living expenses, independent students find themselves unable to pay tuition and meet their basic living expenses. They are forced to defer or even forgo higher education. 
Second, the current law creates a disincentive to work. If a student knows that earning more than $3,000 will reduce the size of his or her Pell grant award, the student can easily conclude that there is no reason to try to earn more than $3,000 a year. 
Third, it penalizes students who are trying to pay for their education through work rather than by borrowing. This is particularly unfair to the almost 75 percent of dependent undergraduates who are working while studying to pay college expenses. When earnings result in lower grants, these students must turn to larger loans to finance their education. 
The Working Students' Income Protection Act will make great strides toward correcting these problems. It will allow single independent students to retain $6,000 of their earnings for basic living expenses, married working independent students to retain $9,000, and working dependent students to retain $4,200 before they begin to loose their Pell grants. This will not only make higher education more affordable for these students, it will also encourage and reward work, a worthwhile objective. 
Moreover, these changes will correct an injustice by providing benefits to a segment of the student population that has been largely overlooked by the changes in student aid recently passed or currently under consideration. Increasing Pell grants by $300, for example, a move that I strongly support, which was included in the budget agreement, will not help the working students who are ineligible for these grants because of the inadequate level of the current IPA. Similarly, the tuition tax credit will not help them because they are not earning enough to pay taxes. By increasing the IPA, these students will be able to share in the government assistance available to those seeking to pursue a higher education. 
I would like to give you some examples from the University of Southern Maine, a State-supported institution serving 10,000 students. These students have an average age of just under 30 years. They are largely independent students and they are balancing jobs, school, and often family responsibilities. When these students have incomes above the IPA, which they must have to survive, they are not eligible for Pell grants under the current law. Let me describe two of these students to you. 
Both are single students. The first is a 25-year-old junior recreation therapy major. She has worked as a nurses aide since graduating from high school, and she continues to work full time during the summers and part time during the school year. The second is a 31-year-old social work major. He works year round in a variety of part-time restaurant and clerical jobs. Both have total gross earnings of about $15,000 per year. 
The current income protection allowance permits each of these students to retain only $3,000 for basic living expenses. It assumes that the remainder is available for calculating the family contribution toward educational expenses. The Working Students' Income Protection Act will allow each of these students to retain $6,000 for basic living expenses and will restore their eligibility for Pell grants. It will allow them to complete their education without incurring significant amounts of debt. 
The president of the University of Southern Maine, Richard Pattenaude, has often noted that the mission of a public university is to help people of diverse backgrounds achieve their goals. These citizens, including recent high school graduates, adult learners with jobs and families, and single parents, all come to us, he says,  
With dreams of becoming more than they are. I am always moved and inspired by how hard our students work to realize those dreams and how deeply they care about their educations. These students underscore the significance of maintaining support for higher education if we are to enter the 21st century with an educational system ready to meet the needs and challenges of the people we serve. 
By increasing the income protection allowance, the Working Students' Income Protection Act will take a major step toward meeting this challenge by helping working students afford college and encouraging them to pursue higher education. 
Later in this Congress, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, whose chairman is here today, will mark up the Higher Education Act reauthorization legislation. It is my hope that this legislation will be incorporated into the committee's bill. 
Enacting this modest change will make a significant and positive change in the lives of thousands and thousands of students in the United States I urge my colleagues to show their support by cosponsoring this bill.

Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise in very reluctant opposition to the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions. I do believe that the issue of attorney's fees is an important one. But it should be debated in the context of the global tobacco settlement. My fear is that despite the best intentions of the sponsors of this amendment that passage of the Sessions amendment would jeopardize the underlying Durbin-Collins amendment to repeal the $50 billion tax giveaway to big tobacco. For that reason, I am going to vote to table Senator Sessions' amendment. 
I do want to point out one issue that has become obscured in this debate, and that is that the money that will be paid in attorney's fees does not come out of the $368.5 billion global settlement. Instead, the attorney's fees will be paid by the tobacco industry, separate from the settlement. So the attorney's fees do not diminish the amount of the $368.5 billion settlement. I think that is an important point that has been lost in this debate. 
I share the concerns of my colleague from Alabama about an attorney's fees. I think there are, however, constitutional issues about whether Congress can step in and abrogate contracts that were reached between the States attorneys general and private law firms. That is an issue that deserves to be thoroughly explored. But, most of all, I urge my colleagues, whatever their position on the tobacco settlement, whatever their position on the issue of attorney's fees, to save this debate for a more appropriate time. 
And that is when the global tobacco settlement is before the Senate. My fear is that the passage of this amendment would jeopardize the underlying amendment to repeal the $50 billion tax break, and I do not believe we should allow that to happen. For this reason, I will support the motion to table, offered by the Senator from Illinois. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am pleased to be joining with my colleague from Illinois in offering this amendment to repeal the tax break that was slipped into the tax bill at the very last minute to benefit the tobacco industry. I note that the distinguished Presiding Officer, my colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, is also a strong supporter and cosponsor of our effort. 
This provision, which amounts to a $50 billion giveaway to big tobacco, has generated justifiable outrage across the country and fueled the tremendous cynicism that already colors the American public's view of politics and politicians. 
Now, Madam President, where did this tax break come from? It was not in the Senate tax bill. It was not in the House version of the bill. There was never any public debate. The one-sentence provision just magically appeared at the end of a 327-page conference report tucked into a section entitled `Technical Amendments Related to Small Business, Job Protection, and Other Legislation.' 
No one claimed parentage. Like Harriet Beecher Stowe's Topsy, `She wasn't born, she just was.' 
While no one has officially spoken up to claim this orphan, it turns out, according to press reports, that the provision was written not by Members of Congress, but by the tobacco industry. 
Madam President, this is outrageous. It is backroom politics at its worst, and represents the kind of abuse of the legislative process that the American public is rightfully sick and tired of--a secret agreement, negotiated behind closed doors, by powerful tobacco industry lobbyists, in the closing hours of consideration of a massive tax bill. 
Congress is currently considering the proposed $368.5 billion global settlement negotiated between 40 attorneys general and the tobacco industry. As we review this settlement, one of our primary objectives is to ensure that the tobacco industry has negotiated in good faith and is held fully accountable for their past misconduct. 
Many of us have harbored suspicions about the tobacco companies' supposedly good intentions during these negotiations. We have been concerned that the tobacco companies would simply raise prices and write off the settlement payments, effectively passing on the costs of the settlement to the taxpayer and the tobacco consumer. 
Well, Madam President, worst suspicions confirmed. Not only can the tobacco companies write off the entire $368 billion as a business expense, which means that 30 to 40 percent of the tobacco settlement costs will be subsidized by the taxpayers, but now the Congress, in a moment of midnight madness, has carved out a brand-new tax break for these companies that effectively reduces the costs of the settlement by $50 billion. 
It is outrageous that we should even consider approving this tax break and passing on these costs to the American taxpayer. Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in the United States. It accounts for approximately 500,000 deaths a year and billions of dollars in health care costs. The tobacco companies have agreed to the settlement as a means of reducing their future liability and are providing some compensation to States and individuals for the costs they face because of the disease and addiction associated with their products. 
Regardless of our position on the proposed tobacco settlement, we should all agree to reject this $50 billion special tax break for the industry. 
Now, some would have us believe that the $50 billion tax credit is part of the tobacco settlement. This is simply not true. In fact, this concept was discussed and soundly rejected during the negotiations between the attorneys general and the tobacco industry. In fact, the States attorneys general strongly oppose this new tax credit.

Ms. COLLINS. In that letter they state that they regard this action as `a substantial alteration of a material term' of the agreement and that they will `exercise their option of rejecting the settlement and continuing the prosecution of their lawsuits' if it is included. 
Madam President, this secret tax break should never have been written into law in the first place. It should be repealed immediately. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Durbin-Collins amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, in offering an amendment to restore $35 million in funding for the State Student Incentive Grant Program. 
First, I want to thank and recognize the able leadership of the Senator from Rhode Island in this area. I also want to say I very much appreciate the work of the managers of this bill, Senators Specter and Senator Harkin, in working with Senator Reed and myself to find an offset that will allow us to achieve funding for this very important program. 
The SSIG program has successfully leveraged a relatively small Federal contribution and investment in student aid to build a State-Federal partnership supporting grants to the neediest college students. Last year, a Federal appropriation of $63 million resulted in a match of $784 million in State expenditures for need-based scholarship grants. In the State of Maine alone, 12,000 students received assistance under this important program. Nationally, grants averaging $1,200 were awarded to about 700,000 students. The recipients, Mr. President, come from families with average incomes of $12,000 a year. As the Senator from Rhode Island has pointed out, that is below the Federal poverty level for a family of four. 
Mr. President, it would be a serious mistake to terminate this program. Every single Federal dollar that it provides goes to students with financial need. The States bear the administrative costs, so every single Federal dollar goes for the grants for these needy students. This program helps to close the widening gap between what students receive in grant assistance and what they are forced to borrow to pay for the ever-increasing costs of a college education. 
Because of high tuition costs and increased borrowing, students are graduating from college with higher and higher debt burdens. This Congress has recognized the problem that this mountain of debt poses for new graduates. It has attempted to ease that burden by making the interests on student loans tax deductible, but then if we turn around and eliminate the Federal contribution to the SSIG program we will, in fact, be counteracting part of this benefit to the most deserving students by increasing their loan burden. 
Now, Mr. President, opponents to continuing the SSIG program argue the purpose for the program no longer exists since each of the 50 States have established a grant program. However, this overlooks the importance of SSIG as the Federal-State partnership and the important role this program plays in maintaining the State commitment to these grants. According to the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, 43 States--43 States--would reduce their need-based grants if the SSIG program were eliminated. Some would clearly terminate their grant programs altogether without the SSIG contribution. Clearly, in spite of the impressive efforts ahead by many States to help their neediest students, this program continues to be a critical catalyst for State action. 
As college costs continue to grow faster than income and grant aid, and as the grant-loan imbalance widens for students of modest means, the need for SSIG is more important than ever before. This Congress has just acknowledged the value of grants by voting for a modest increase in the maximum amount of Pell grants. It would be inconsistent and incredibly poor timing if at the time we are recognizing the need for an increase in the grants under the Pell program, we turn around and reduce assistance under the SSIG program.

Ms. COLLINS. I quote just briefly from Stephanie D'Amico's letter. 
She wrote: 
College is one of the best investments we can make in America's future. It is critical to a strong democracy and a healthy economy. To me personally it represents opportunity for the future. Unfortunately, a college education is becoming harder and harder to afford. . . . SSIG is one of the best Federal programs helping to provide access to education. . . . Students and their families need help with the costs of college. With students now graduating with decades of debt, loans are not the answer. . . . SSIG is a good, working program that helps students stay in school. 
Mr. President, if America is truly to remain the land of opportunity, we must ensure that our citizens like Stephanie D'Amico do not face insurmountable obstacles to higher education. This program will help Stephanie D'Amico and many like her to achieve the American dream. I urge support of the Reed-Collins amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, which would cut funding severely for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and increase funding for the Pell Grant Program. 
There is no stronger supporter of the Pell Grant Program in the U.S. Senate than I. In fact, very shortly I will be introducing legislation to expand working students' eligibility for Pell grants. However, when faced with this amendment, I must ask the question: Are we so poor a country that some must be cold, go hungry, forgo medications so that others may learn? The answer is obvious. This amendment presents a false choice. 
Maine is well known for its cold and very long winters. Many of Maine's residents, along with the citizens of other Northern States, are heavily dependent on the aid provided by LIHEAP in order to heat their homes during the cold winter months. Without the assistance of LIHEAP, 33,000 of Maine's most vulnerable and needy citizens--I am talking about elderly people, the disabled, and very low-income families--will go without adequate heat during the coming winter or will be forced to forgo medications or even food. We must not allow this to happen. 
As Senator Specter and Senator Harkin have noted, 70 percent of the people receiving this home heating assistance have incomes under $8,000 a year. We are talking about people who are very needy. This bill's funding for LIHEAP is not excessive. In fact, it's approximately the amount that was spent last year, and that amount was not adequate to serve all of the people needing assistance. Last year this program provided 33,000 Mainers with an average subsidy of $308. That is only enough to buy a couple of tanks of heating oil. For many, this small amount of help is, however, the difference between being in a comfortably heated home and freezing. 
This is not an excessive expenditure. Failure to appropriate at least this amount will only result in a call for emergency funding later this year, an event that has occurred in each of the past 4 years. I agree with the able and distinguished Senator from Arizona that funding for Pell grants should be increased, but I cannot support a reduction in LIHEAP as a means of accomplishing this. 
A recent editorial from the Portland Press Herald in my State put it well when it stated: 
The idea of LIHEAP may seem frivolous to lawmakers from warm, southern States. However, the subsidy remains essential to residents in colder climates. That's especially true now when welfare cuts and a rising cost of living have pushed so many poor families so much closer to the edge. Asking low-income and elderly Mainers to choose between filling their fuel tanks or their cupboards is not fair. 
I conclude my remarks by stating that asking the U.S. Senate to choose between LIHEAP and Pell grants is also not fair. It is a false choice and I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Arizona. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman, Senator Roth, for the extraordinary work he has done to bring this before us today for passage. 
Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the conference report on the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the first major tax cut for the middle class that the Congress has passed since 1981. 
This historic tax cut bill, along with the companion Balanced Budget Act, represents very good news for the American people. These measures put the Federal Government on the road to a balanced budget, and will provide much-needed tax relief for middle-class families in Maine and across the Nation. 
There are several small business and education provisions that I am particularly pleased to see included in the legislation before us today. These proposals have been among my highest priorities since coming to the Senate. 
In fact, the very first bill I introduced as a Senator was designed to provide tax relief for family-owned businesses and farms. I am, therefore, delighted that the Taxpayer Relief Act will provide substantial estate or death tax relief for family-owned businesses and farms, the backbone of our economy in Maine. Effective in January of next year, these businesses and farms will be eligible for a $1.3 million exemption from Federal estate taxes, more than double the current $600,000 exemption. 
Mr. President, I cannot tell you how strongly I feel about providing this relief. Time and again family business owners in Maine have told me of their painful decisions to dismember their companies, to sell them to large out-of-State corporations, in order to avoid saddling their children with enormous debt to pay the estate tax. The tax is wrong. It is simply unfair. We ought to be encouraging family businesses to prosper and to continue from generation to generation. 
Given that family businesses will create two-thirds of the new jobs in the future, our Tax Code should encourage their creation, expansion, and continuation. The current estate tax structure penalizes job creation and, according to several studies, has actually cost our Nation as many as 220,000 jobs--220,000 jobs lost because of this onerous tax. Passing the estate tax relief provisions of this bill will allow family business owners to invest in their companies, rather than in a platoon of attorneys, accountants, and insurance agents attempting to alleviate the estate tax bite. 
Adopting this proposal will mean that these businesses and farms can stay in the family, and be passed from generation to generation, from parents to their children, instead of being sold in order to pay taxes as happens all too frequently under the current estate tax laws. These reforms will help keep the family in our family businesses and good jobs in our communities. 
In addition, the tax package contains some very important reforms that will help make a college education more affordable for middle-income families, another of my top priorities. 
Mr. President, prior to serving in the Senate, I worked at Husson College, a small college in Bangor, ME, whose students primarily come from lower and middle-income families. Most Husson students are the first members of their family to attend college. 
At Husson, I came to appreciate the critical role that Pell grants and student loan programs play in making college available to many students, but I also learned that our current programs do far too little to help many middle-class families who have to carry the heavy burden of college costs for their children largely by themselves. 
This is a very serious problem. I am pleased that this legislation contains several provisions that are specifically designed to make it easier for middle-income families to save for their children's education and to help graduates pay back their student loans. 
For example, families will be allowed to establish tax-deferred education IRA's that reward them for planning and saving for their children's college education. 
Especially important, this legislation allows students to deduct up to $2,500 annually in interest on their student loans. Many college graduates are faced with daunting debts that will strain their finances for years. We currently do not do enough for those for whom the road to college ends not with a pot of gold but with a pile of debt. 
Many college graduates are faced with daunting debts from their student loans that will strain their finances for years. 
Many students in my home State of Maine, when confronted with this dilemma, either decide not to pursue a college education at all, or decide to drop out of college. That is one important reason why Maine ranks a dismal 49th out of the 50 States in the number of high school graduates going on to college. That is why this student loan interest deduction is so critical to bringing college within reach of many middle-income families. 
Mr. President, these proposals--the education savings account and the tax deduction for student loan interest--were included in legislation I introduced earlier this year, the College Access and Affordability Act of 1997. I am very pleased to see that they were included in the conference report. Making higher education more accessible and affordable is essential if we are to have a high-quality work force able to compete in a global marketplace in the 21st century. 
Finally, Mr. President, I want to note several other important provisions that will help our small businesses--the job creators in this country. This legislation will make health insurance more affordable for the 82,000 people in Maine who are self-employed. They include our lobstermen, our hairdressers, our electricians, our plumbers, and many owners of our small mom-and-pop stores that dot the communities throughout our State. 
Under this package, self-employed workers will be able to deduct 100 percent of their health insurance premiums by the year 2007. Establishing parity of health insurance costs between the self-employed and those working for large businesses is a matter of basic equity, and it will also help to reduce the number of uninsured, but working, Americans. 
Finally, another important provision for small businesses is the restoration of the home office tax deduction, which was nullified by a Supreme Court ruling several years ago. Home-based businesses are exploding all over Maine. This bill will enable many entrepreneurs in Maine and throughout the Nation to once again deduct the very legitimate expenses associated with working out of their homes. 
Mr. President, in closing, I want to once again commend the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, the distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, and Senator Nickles, Senator Moynihan, the ranking minority member, and all of those who have played such a vital role in crafting such historic legislation. It will provide tax relief to our families, to our small businesses, to our family farms, and to our students--to our entrepreneurs. 
It is a terrific bill that deserves broad bipartisan support. This legislation has my enthusiastic support, and I appreciate very much being able to speak to my colleagues on this issue. 
Thank you. I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleagues, particularly Senator McCain and Senator Feingold, in announcing our intent to bring bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation to a vote in September. At the State level, Maine has led the Nation on this issue, and the people of my State think the time has come for Congress to step up to the plate and enact meaningful reform. 
As a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have spent the past month listening to testimony about illegal campaign contributions. It is not a pretty picture. In my opening statement at the hearings, I observed that our political system suffers from a mania for money. If anything, the hearings have demonstrated that I underestimated just how intense that mania is. 
Mr. President, we should be embarrassed by how our political system is viewed. Listen to the judgment rendered by Johnny Chung, one of the individuals alleged to have laundered foreign political contributions. `I see the White House is like a subway--you have to put in coins to open the gates.' What Mr. Chung did not say, because he did not have to say it, is that the vast majority of hard-working and honest Americans do not have enough coins to make the gates open. 
This is not a partisan observation. All of us in this Chamber--Republicans and Democrats alike--should be embarrassed at the perception that the leaders of the greatest Nation on earth are accessible only to those with enough coins. 
Mr. President, we should be embarrassed that the American people are convinced that we will never reform the system, 
that we will never put the integrity of our political system ahead of our self-interests. 
Some argue that the relative quiet of the people means they are satisfied with the status quo, but that is wrong. In this case, silence sends a stronger message of disapproval than the loudest shouts of protest. The message that it sends is that people have given up on us. Look at the reform efforts at the State level, and you will see that it is not that the voters do not believe in campaign finance reform. It is that they do not believe in the U.S. Senate. 
We all know that if left untreated, the disease that afflicts our political system will only grow worse. With the high cost of television ads, the money frenzy can only grow. Indeed, the television ad race has become the political counterpart of the nuclear arms race characterized by the same insecure feeling that one can never have enough. 
None of us involved in this effort has all of the answers. We recognize that reforming our campaign finance laws raises difficult issues of public policy and thorny issues of constitutional law. Our approach is not set in stone. We are open to other ideas. We are open to compromise, but we are not open to letting the Senate duck this issue. Like my colleagues, I look forward to working with the leadership of this body to bring this matter to a vote. We have an obligation to the American people to ensure that such a vote comes about, and we are determined to make that happen in September. 
Mr. President, the American dream has undergone some changes, not all of which are for the better. We are now living in a country in which any millionaire can dream of growing up to be a United States Senator. That may be an acceptable state of affairs during a time of peace and prosperity, when the Government does not need to call upon the people of this Nation to make sacrifices. But the unhealthy mix between money and politics may produce far more worrisome consequences during periods when America is tested. As with all reforms, the time to make them is before they are urgently needed. 
I look forward to a vigorous debate and vote on this issue in September. I thank my colleagues for working with me on this important issue. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Transportation appropriations bill and to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee, Senator Shelby, about the ability of the State of Maine to use funding from this legislation to conduct a National Environmental Protection Act study for improving the travel corridor from Houlton to Fort Kent, ME. 
Under S. 1048, as approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee, the State of Maine is expected to receive a much-needed increase of almost $17 million for vital highway programs. This will bring the total for the next fiscal year to approximately $105 million. This additional funding--the $17 million--will enable the Maine Department of Transportation to fund a number of high-priority transportation projects, including the NEPA study, which will help my State tremendously. 
I want to commend both the chairman and the ranking minority member of the subcommittee for their hard work and leadership in ensuring that significant transportation funding increases are available, at a time when setting priorities for scarce tax dollars has never been more challenging. For large rural States like my home State of Maine, the funding in this legislation provides the money necessary to build, repair, maintain, and improve our roads, which are absolutely essential to expanding our economy and to providing our citizens with better job opportunities into the 21st century. 
In fact, in Maine, studies have shown that approximately 80 percent of all economic development has occurred within 10 miles of our interstate highway. Consequently, it is not surprising that economic activity in central and northern Aroostook County, where I am from, which is not served by the Interstate Highway System, has lagged far behind those areas of the State with access to the four-lane interstate. 
Earlier this year, the State of Maine completed an initial feasibility study that evaluated several different options for improving the travel corridor between Houlton and Fort Kent, a distance of roughly 125 miles. The initial study was funded by Congress with an appropriation of $800,000 about 3 years ago. 
Now, the State is prepared to take the next step in this process, which is to conduct a NEPA study on the various options. This study will, among other things, analyze the traffic demand for preliminary design engineering, assess the noise and air quality impact, develop and review alternatives within the corridor, update the construction cost analysis, and prepare an environmental impact statement. 
The need for this funding, Mr. President, is crystal clear. Upgrading the transportation infrastructure in Aroostook County, the largest county in my State, is essential to strengthening its economy. For example, in order to compete effectively, Aroostook County potato farmers and lumber industries need to improve their ability to transport goods efficiently from northern Maine to their markets. 
Upgrading the transportation system will also spur new economic development and business investment. The tourism industry, particularly snowmobiling, has absolutely exploded in recent years. But if it is to continue to grow, this promising industry needs an improved road system to bring more snowmobilers to Aroostook County. 
Similarly, the people of Aroostook County are moving forward in their efforts to redevelop the site of the former Loring Air Force Base in Limestone, ME. An enhanced highway system is absolutely vital to their ability to attract new economic investment that can best utilize the base's outstanding facilities and help to replace the thousands of jobs that were lost when the base closed. 
Proceeding with this additional study at this time will help 
us determine how best to improve the travel corridor, and it ultimately will make it easier for northern Maine to compete for new business investments, to find new market opportunities for agricultural, manufactured, and timber-related products, and to produce increased tourism opportunities, as well. 
I just want to take this opportunity to confirm with the chairman of the subcommittee my understanding that the State of Maine, which has included this project as part of its 20-year statewide transportation plan, can use a portion of the roughly $17 million in higher Federal highway funding from this legislation to pursue and conduct the NEPA study. 
Mr. President, at this point, I will yield the floor to the chairman of the subcommittee so that he may respond to my inquiry.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gregg, regarding the National Weather Service's ongoing top-to-bottom review of its operations and structure. 
I am taking this opportunity today to express my hope and belief that this review process will conclude that the Weather Service Office in Caribou, ME, should be fully upgraded to a Weather Forecasting Office. I just want to comment very briefly, Mr. President, on a few of the reasons why the Caribou Weather Service Office should be upgraded. 
In general, it is the Weather Service's policy that weather forecasting offices should cover roughly 17,000 square miles. Right now, the Weather Forecasting Office in Gray, ME--which is more than 230 miles from Caribou--is attempting to provide services for roughly 63,000 square miles, an area more than three times larger than the norm. Given the huge area involved, it is extremely difficult for the small staff of a Weather Service Office to provide the services necessary to ensure public safety. 
For example, the Weather Service Office currently has only one electrical technician who must service equipment in Frenchville, Caribou, Houlton, and as far south as Millinocket, in Penobscot County. This is an enormous workload for just one employee, particularly in light of the possibility that repairs may be needed at the same time at different locations far away from each other. 
Accurate and timely weather reports are essential to Aroostook County, the largest county in Maine, for two reasons: one involving public safety, the other an economic concern. 
Mr. President, northern Maine experiences more than its fair share of severe weather, including blizzards in the winter months. Many of my colleagues have probably heard weather reports in which my hometown of Caribou has recorded the lowest temperature in the Continental United States. Accurate and timely weather reports are essential for public safety. 
The second reason for upgrading the Weather Service Office centers on the nature of the economy in the county. Natural resource-based industries such as agriculture, logging, and tourism are the mainstay of the county's economy. Our potato farmers, for example, must have quality weather forecasts and reports in order to know best when to plant and harvest their crops. 
For these public safety and economic reasons, I am convinced that upgrading the Weather Service Office in Caribou is a necessary action for the National Weather Service to undertake, and I hope that the Appropriations Committee will act favorably on upcoming funding requests. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor so that my distinguished New England neighbor and colleague, Senator Gregg, may respond to my concerns.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first I express my appreciation to the very able managers of this legislation, Senator Campbell and Senator Kohl, for their willingness to accept the amendment which has been proposed by myself, Senator Shelby and Senator Grassley. 
Let me just briefly explain the amendment and its purpose. 
This amendment would prohibit the inspector general of the Department of Treasury from spending any money on consulting contracts, and it would make a corresponding reduction in the inspector general's budget by cutting it by $1 million. 
Let me first make clear that this amendment is not intended to affect in any way any audit, inspection, investigation or law enforcement function of the Inspector General's Office. The reduction proposed in my amendment is intended to be taken from administrative expenses, specifically the budget classification called `Other services,' which is funded in the President's budget at $2.4 million. My amendment would leave $1.4 million available for that classification. 
I am offering this amendment today because there is clear, disturbing and credible evidence that the incumbent inspector general has abused her contracting authority by spending taxpayer dollars on management studies of questionable value and of excessive cost. 
For example, in April of this year, press accounts revealed that the inspector general had let a soul-source contract for a management study of her office. This $90,000 contract was awarded without the benefit of fair and open competition, and it was awarded to a friend of hers, someone who had in fact recommended her for the position of inspector general. 
Mr. President, I have personally reviewed the final product of this contract. It is a 20-page report costing taxpayers $4,500 per page. 
Another example of questionable activity occurred in September of 1995 when the inspector general awarded another contract, again without full and open competition, for $85,000 that subsequently ballooned to cost more than $300,000. My amendment would curtail these kinds of abuses in contracting by limiting the amount of funds available for this purpose and by prohibiting the inspector general from spending money on consulting services. In the meantime, without prejudging the ultimate outcome, the permanent subcommittee on investigations, of which I am the Chair, will continue its in-depth investigation into the contracting practices of this office.

I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Hutchinson's sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I want to make clear that my support of this nonbinding resolution signifies my grave concerns about most-favored-nation status for China rather than a final decision about this important policy question. 
Last month, the House of Representatives debated a resolution of disapproval that would have denied most-favored-nation status for China as proposed by President Clinton. The House rejected this measure, thereby supporting the Clinton administration's proposal to extend MFN status for China for another year. 
Given this action by the House, the U.S. Senate will not have a formal debate and vote this year on the President's recommendation. Nevertheless, I recognize that this issue raises some very serious issues that need more debate and consideration than the very brief debate that the Senate has given this issue today. 
Like many of my colleagues in the Senate, I am very troubled by the actions of the Chinese Government in Beijing. It has a very poor record on human rights issues. It has repeatedly violated trade agreements.

It denies the religious freedom of its citizens. It maintains an antidemocratic posture toward Taiwan and Tibet. And, finally, our Senate investigation into campaign finance abuses has revealed a plan by China to funnel illegal political contributions into American campaigns. 
Given all of the ramifications, I believe that at an appropriate time and place, the Senate should engage in a full-fledged debate that gives these matters the attention that they truly deserve. 
In conclusion, I am withholding final judgment on the question of most-favored-nation status for China, but in the meantime, I am expressing my very serious concerns and reservations by supporting the nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by the Senator from Arkansas. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, and the ranking minority members, Senator Inouye, for accepting this very crucial amendment which I have proudly cosponsored with Senator Snowe. 
With the recent proliferation of chemical weapons and the increasing uncertainty of rogue nations' ability to wage chemical and biological war, I strongly believe that this additional $2 million in funding is essential to properly address this very serious threat. 
A joint service core research program will make possible the development of a prototype hybrid integrated sensor array for chemical and biological point detection for personnel use on the battlefield. While it is my hope that some day sensors of this type are not necessary, until such time, I will continue to ensure that our service men and women are not left unaware or unprotected. 
Again, I extend my sincere thanks to Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for supporting this critical amendment and I thank my fellow Maine colleague, Senator Snowe, for her leadership on this matter as well.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the members of the Senate Finance Committee, ably led by chairman Roth and ranking member Moynihan, for their willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion to bring meaningful and much-needed tax relief to the American people. 
The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 is extremely important legislation. While it makes many significant changes, I want to focus my remarks on the provisions that will provide long-overdue estate tax relief for family-owned businesses and farms and on those that will help lower- and moderate-income families put their children through college. 
The first bill I sponsored as a U.S. Senator was targeted death tax relief for family-owned businesses and farms. This was no accident, for I firmly believe that small, family-owned enterprises hold the key to our economic future. It is these family businesses that will create two-thirds of all new jobs for the people of the United States in the 21st century. 
Regrettably, our current tax code penalizes family-owned businesses by making it difficult, if not impossible in some cases, for families to pass the business down from generation to generation. In fact, fewer than one-third of all family-owned businesses survive the transition from the first generation to the second. 
Our tax policy should produce the very opposite result, and I am gratified that a strong, bipartisan majority of the Senate Finance Committee recognized this problem and supported action to put us on the right track. Specifically, S. 949 establishes a $1 million exemption from Federal estate taxes for closely-held family businesses, thereby making it easier for parents to pass their business along to their children. My estate tax relief bill, S. 482, contained the very same provision, and I commend the Finance Committee for including it in their legislation which we just passed. 
The Finance Committee's proposal will help to make real the dreams of those Americans who work long hours to build a business so they can turn it over to their children. It will help individuals like the potato bag manufacturer in northern Maine who would expand his business and hire more new employees were it not for the money he has to invest in estate planning and insurance. And it will help the small businesswoman in Portland, ME, who wishes to leave her restaurant to her son and avoid the problem she faced when her father died and the family had to sell 24 of their 25 restaurants to pay the estate tax bill. 
Mr. President, by preserving family-owned enterprises, we not only strengthen American businesses, we also strengthen American families. 
Mr. President, I also want to commend the Finance Committee for including several very important provisions that will help lower- and middle-income families finance college educations for their children. Many of the provisions are similar to those in my legislation, the College Access and Affordability Act of 1997. 
For the last 30 years, the Federal Government has helped make post-secondary education available to millions of high school students, thereby giving them a chance to fulfill their potential to the greatest extent possible. The primary vehicles for this invaluable Federal assistance to lower-income and middle-income families have been the Pell grant and student loan programs, both of which I wholeheartedly support. 
But our student aid programs have had the unintended consequence of punishing those families who struggle to save for their children's education and then become ineligible for Federal assistance because of their savings. To its credit, the Finance Committee recognized that with the greatly increased cost of a college education, these families also are deserving of help, and it took several important steps in that direction. 
First, the bill that we just passed also establishes education investment accounts to help families save for their children's college education. Under this plan, families can contribute up to $2,000 a year to a special savings account and not have to pay taxes on the account's earnings if they use the money for qualified educational expanses, such as room, board, and tuition. Along similar lines, the Finance Committee approved a proposal that allows families who have created Individual Retirement Accounts [IRA's] to withdraw funds for post-secondary and graduate education without penalty. 
Second, the Committee's bill allows annual dedications of up to $2,500 for interest paid on student loans. This will help to soften the financial burden on students like the young woman in my State who recently graduated from college with $18,000 in debt and who returned to her home town in rural Maine where high-paying jobs are simply not available. 
Finally, the Committee adopted a permanent extension of the section 127 program, which allows employees who receive up to $5,250 in employer-provided tuition assistance to exclude this assistance from their taxable income. We live in times of rapid change when workers may often need new skills to remain employable, and the section 127 program can be the key to making this possible. 
Taken together, these proposals represent a major step forward in our efforts to help lower-income and middle-income families finance higher education for themselves and their children. These changes will benefit not only our students but also our Nation, for a better educated population will be better able to compete in our global economy. By making education more affordable for all, we also reaffirm that America is the country of opportunity, where success is there for all who are willing to work for it. 
Mr. President, let me conclude my remarks with the observation that S. 949 is notable not only for what it provides but also for how it was produced. Led by their Chair, the members of the Taxation Committee put aside partisan concerns and crafted a bill which can command widespread support both in Congress and in the country. Despite the rhetoric of those bent on sowing the seeds of division, the legislation benefits all Americans, as reflected in the fact that a family of four earning $30,000 will receive a 53 percent tax cut under the plan. 
Mr. President, the people of my State want results and not rhetoric, cooperation and not confrontation. The Family Tax Relief Act of 1997 shows what we can accomplish when we honor the wishes of those who sent us here.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak about S. 930, the College Affordability and Access Act of 1997, which I introduced yesterday. 
More than 30 years ago, Congress took the historic step of authorizing Federal student aid programs for the purpose of `making available the benefits of postsecondary education to eligible students.' Since that time, millions of young Americans have been afforded an opportunity often denied their parents--a college education. 
During the three decades since the passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965, both the cost and the importance of postsecondary education have grown dramatically. And, unfortunately, many once again find themselves without the financial resources needed to unlock the door to a better future. 
There was a time in Maine when a person armed with a high school diploma and a willingness to work hard could expect to get a job in a paper mill and be assured of a very good wage for life. Today, however, the situation is very different. The manager of one mill told me that it has been 10 years since they hired a high school graduate. Similarly, if you visit the recently built recycling mill in East Millinocket, ME, you are likely to see a handful of computer operators using specialized training to run highly technical equipment. 
At a time when 85 percent of the new jobs require some postsecondary schooling, the challenge for the children of less affluent families is to obtain higher education, and the challenge for us is to make that a possibility. 
We cannot and should not guarantee our young people success, but we can and should strive to guarantee them opportunity. We have a good record on which to build, as the student aid programs of the Higher Education Act have assisted countless young Americans. Those programs do not, however, do enough to assist middle-class families in coping with the ever-escalating cost of higher education. And they certainly do not do enough to help those for whom the cost of college is a crushing debt load. 
Mr. President, much of the impetus for this bill comes from my experience working at Husson College, a small college in Bangor, ME, as well as from the education hearings that Senator Jeffords and I held in that city. Husson's students primarily come from lower- and middle-income families; in most cases, they are the first members of their family to attend college. That makes Husson the perfect laboratory from which to assess the strengths and weaknesses of our current student aid programs. 
From my Husson experience, I came to appreciate the critical role of 
Pell Grants and student loan programs in opening the doors to college for many students. But I also learned that our current programs do far too little for the many middle-class families who must largely bear the financial burden of opening those doors for their children. We also do not do enough for those for whom the road to college ends not with a pot of gold but with a pile of debt. Indeed, even at a school with moderate tuition, like Husson, a student participating in the Pell Grant and Federal Work Study Programs can expect to graduate not only with a degree but also with a debt of more than $15,000. And if this student goes on to graduate or professional school, the indebtedness could easily exceed $100,000. 
Missy Chasse, a student who worked for me at Husson, typifies this problem. After graduating with an $18,000 debt, she decided to return to her home town of Ashland in rural Maine where the prospect of a job paying more than $20,000 is remote. Missy is now faced with a daunting debt that will strain her finances for years to come. Many people, confronted with this prospect, simply drop out of college or decide not to go at all. 
The dilemma facing middle-class American families who have to rely on borrowing to educate their children was captured in a letter I recently received from Maine parents. They wrote:  
We both work and are caught in the middle--too much income for aid and not enough to support college tuition. Our daughter has almost completed her second year of college with two more to go. She has loans, we have loans, and it is becoming increasingly harder to keep our heads above water. We have another daughter entering college in three years and we wonder how we will be able to swing it. 
That the experience of this family is widespread is borne out by the statistics. According to the Finance Authority of Maine, the average size of the education loans it guarantees has more than quadrupled during the past 10 years. The prospect of being saddled with a terrifying debt explains why many Maine families decide that the cost of college is simply too great for them. Indeed, Maine ranks a dismal 49th out of the 50 States in the percentage of our young people who decide to go on to higher education. 
Mr. President, this is the season when Members of this body hit the commencement trail, summoning up their most stirring rhetoric to inspire college graduates to dedicate themselves to serving others. The irony is that the audience is far more likely to see its future not as one of serving its neighbors, but rather as one of servicing its debt. 
My bill recognizes that we have a solid foundation of financial assistance 
programs. It seeks to build on that foundation by making needed changes that will provide some measure of debt relief, promote private savings, and encourage employer sponsorship of education. 
Specifically, the College Affordability and Access Act of 1997 has three components. The first will make the interest on student loans tax deductible. The second will authorize the establishment of tax-exempt education savings accounts. And the third will make permanent the tax exemption for employer-paid tuition for undergraduate programs and extend it to graduate and professional programs. 
The first component, a small step for Government that will be a big help to students, allows a tax deduction of up to $2,750 in interest that individuals pay on their student loans. It will alleviate some of the financial pain experienced by the recent graduate with the $18,000 debt and the $20,000 salary. While the deduction will be phased out as the graduate's income increases, the vast majority of those with student loans will qualify for all or part of the benefit. Through this change, we will be recognizing that a loan to go to college is not the same as a loan to buy a stereo, but rather an investment in human capital that will pay dividends not only to the borrower but also to our Nation. 
The second component will allow parents to place $1,000 per year into a tax-exempt savings account for the education of a child. Money withdrawn from the account to pay qualified education expenses will not be taxed. Assuming the family puts $1,000 into the account every year for 18 years and the account earns a modest rate of return, the family can expect to accumulate about $35,000, which will put a big dent in their education expenses. 
Our education policies must stop penalizing savings. Under current law, families which make financial sacrifices to save for their children's education may face the paradoxical result that they do not qualify for aid programs available to their less prudent neighbors. While this bill will not eliminate that possibility, it will send the clear message that our Government is prepared to encourage and reward those who save for college. 
The third component seeks to make greater use of the willingness of businesses to further the education of their employees. It will accomplish that in two ways. First, it will make permanent the current tax exemption for employer-paid tuition for undergraduate studies. Second, it will extend this exemption to those attending graduate and professional programs. 
Mr. President, this bill will benefit families facing the challenge of paying for college; it will benefit students currently pursuing their education; and it will benefit graduates struggling to pay their debts. But the benefits will be far more widespread and significant. In its own small way, the College Affordability and Access Act will give us a better educated population, a more competitive economy, and a society in which the rewards are more equally shared. Most important, it will reaffirm our commitment to the principle that success in America should be there for all who are willing to work for it.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first let me say that I applaud the leadership and the determination of Senator Leahy and Senator Hagel to bring this very important issue of landmine deployment before the Senate. We speak today on behalf of people around the world whose lives are imperiled by deadly explosive devices each day as they till their fields, care for their livestock, or, most tragically of all, walk to school. Antipersonnel landmines have been sown in the Earth in such numbers and spread so broadly and indiscriminately over the planet that they have become a very serious health and safety problem for civilians. According to the International Red Cross, landmines kill or maim someone, often children, every 22 minutes. There are an estimated 100 million mines scattered throughout 68 nations. These weapons of terror inflict injury to little children, to farmers, and to our own service men and women serving the cause of peace far from home. Thus far, in Bosnia, landmines have injured more than 250 soldiers under United Nations or NATO command, and they have killed 29 peacekeepers. In fact, landmines are responsible for every single death of American troops in the Balkans. 
I have cosponsored the Leahy-Hagel legislation because it is the right thing to do. Passing this legislation would be an act of moral leadership for this country. Although our attention may be focused on our own American men and women put in harm's way as international peacekeepers, the extent of the global epidemic of injury inflicted by these devices is truly astounding and tragic. Each month, 800 people are killed and 1,200 others are maimed by small mines whose triggers cannot tell the difference between the foot of a child and the foot of a soldier. As a Maine newspaper, the Kennebec Journal, pointed out in an editorial this weekend, the landmine is one of the most insidious and pernicious weapons ever created by man. 
Across the globe, especially in Third World countries, landmines placed during long-forgotten conflicts, some as much as a half-century ago, continue to menace civilian populations. Senator Leahy's bill would draw the line on the deployment of these weapons. This bill will help save the lives and limbs of American peacekeepers as well as of many innocent children in countries around the world. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I want to take this opportunity to highlight a growing problem with securities fraud in this country--a problem which affects thousands of American families who are now investing their hard earned savings in a booming stock market. The problem involves the fraudulent manipulation of the stocks of small companies in scams which can literally wipe out investors who place their trust in unscrupulous brokers and stock promoters. 
Fraud in the sale of small company stocks has been increasing at an alarming rate. In the typical case, unscrupulous brokerage firms, often operating through intermediaries, purchase large positions in a company which is worthless or of very limited value and then drive its price higher through manipulation. They do this by aggressively cold calling thousands of unsuspecting individuals, often inexperienced in investing, and persuading them to purchase the company's stock by greatly exaggerating its financial prospects. The inevitable effect of this massive sales campaign is to push the price higher, at which point the brokerage firm dumps its shares, leaving the public holding investments which rapidly become worthless. 
According to published reports and court proceedings, these schemes often utilize other illegal or unethical practices, including: The dissemination of false information on which investors rely, the employment by brokerage firms of persons with criminal records, as well as the use of unlicensed individuals whose only activity is ostensibly to prospect for customers but who often participate in making sales for which they are paid under the table; and the bribing of brokers to assist in the manipulation by recommending the stock to their trusting customers. 
These securities fraud schemes have been uncovered in recent prosecutions and criminal investigations. At least four grand juries around the country are investigating small-stock manipulation--what may be the financial crime of the 1990's, just as insider trading was the financial crime of the 1980's. Indeed, according to published articles, a Federal grand jury in Los Angeles has even investigated a Federal prosecutor suspected of engaging in securities fraud. And last year, an FBI sting operation in New York City resulted in the arrest of 46 individuals for this type of activity. 
In recent years, the soaring stock market has attracted millions of new investors, many of them hard working families trying to save for the future or elderly Americans trying to expand their retirement savings. it is understandable that these individuals, confronted with the prospect of astronomical tuition bills for their children or escalating medical costs for themselves, fall prey to sales pitches promising high returns in what are supposed to be the glamour companies of the future. 
Overall, it is estimated that one in three American households have some of their assets invested in the stock market. Most do not have the time or the resources to carefully scrutinize stock offerings to determine which ones are fraudulent, instead putting their faith in brokers, who, because they are licensed by the Government, the public believes it has reason to trust. 
Mr. President, some years ago I served as the State of Maine's Commissioner of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, and one of the responsibilities of my department was the protection of investors in my State. While that experience taught me that America has the most dynamic and healthiest capital markets in the world, it also taught me that there is no shortage of con artists and fraudulent schemes. What was true then unfortunately appears to be true today, and regrettably, there is evidence that the problem may be more widespread. 
While the vast majority of those who work in our securities industry are honest, we must be continually vigilant in safeguarding the integrity of our markets. We must remain committed to combating what appears to be a new wave of securities fraud, involving the intense marketing and subsequent manipulation of the stock offerings of small companies, many with high-tech sounding names. These offerings--when pushed by overly aggressive and fraudulent marketing pitches to average American families and the elderly--present a ripe opportunity to lull the investing public into believing the stock is about to take off. Too often, these stocks do not soar to the heavens but rather fail to the ground. 
This fraud must be fought on a variety of fronts. The regulators must continue to enforce existing regulations and to watch for illegal activity. The public must be more careful in investing in the stock market. And the Congress must--and will--closely investigate this growing problem of securities fraud. 
As chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Mr. President. I am concerned about this fraud in the micro-capital markets--about this manipulation of small company stocks by Wall Street bandits. The subcommittee has a long and proud tradition of investigating schemes which rip off innocent consumers and taint the reputations of those who play by the rules. This investigative tradition will continue under my leadership. With more and more Americans entering the stock market each year, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will be looking closely at these matters, investigating how these stock manipulation schemes victimize American investors and how we can arrest this emerging securities fraud. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Governmental Affairs Committee and in the Senate to protect the public from unscrupulous operators who would prey on hard working Americans seeking to participate in the American Dream through investment in the stock market. The expanding economic opportunities presented by a booming stock market should not benefit just the most wealthy Americans, but should benefit average American families as well. 
As the chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I promise you that we will vigorously investigate those who abuse the trust of their fellow citizens seeking to invest their hard earned savings. I further pledge that we will be especially relentless in our efforts to expose schemes which exploit the elderly. During my tenure, the subcommittee will use its investigative authority to shine the light of truth on those who operate in the shadowy fringes of America's capital markets. 
I thank the Senate for its attention. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by my colleague from Florida, calling for a doubling of our investment in biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health over the next 5 years. Now, some may question why we are calling for such a significant increase in spending as part of a balanced budget agreement. However, I believe that our sense-of-the-Senate resolution is entirely consistent with the goal of a balanced budget, because there is no investment that would yield greater returns for the American taxpayer than an investment in biomedical research. 
Our nation currently spends billions of dollars each year, both directly and indirectly, to treat and care for chronic diseases. For example, cardiovascular disease costs us $138 billion each year. Alzheimer's disease costs about $100 billion each year, primarily in nursing home and other long-term care costs. Strokes result in health care costs of almost $30 billion annually. And Parkinson's disease costs our society about $6 billion annually. We basically have two choices. We can sit back and continue to pay the bills and endure the suffering, or we can aggressively pursue a national strategy aimed at preventing, delaying, and even curing these devastating and debilitating diseases and conditions. 
While we are spending billions of dollars each year on patient care, as the Senator from California has pointed out, only 3 cents--3 cents of each health care dollar are currently invested in medical research. Opportunities for progress in biomedical and related health science research have never been better, but currently, we are only funding a fraction of the promising grant applications submitted to NIH. Moreover, not only are the investments in research disproportionately low compared to the cost of patient care, but the potential of research to reduce health care costs is vastly under realized. 
The work of Dr. Jonas Salk and his colleagues to produce a vaccine for polio serves as a dramatic example of research as a high-yield investment. The lifetime costs of maintaining just two children stricken with polio is greater than all of the money --all of the money--ever spent on the research that virtually eliminated the disease. 
The potential for achieving even greater savings from health care research is enormous. For example, the Alliance for Aging Research has estimated that a 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer's disease could cut health care spending by much as $50 billion annually and that a 5-year delay in the onset of stroke could save our Nation $15 billion a year. 
This is no time to put the brakes on research spending. Rather, we should accelerate our efforts and increase our commitment to medical research that can cure, prevent or delay disease. This strategy is especially important as we move into the next century when our public health and disability programs will be increasingly strained by the aging of our population. 
Finally, the cost of disease and disability cannot be measured in dollars alone. Only those who have had to care for a father or a husband whose quality of life has been cut short by a stroke can appreciate how devastating it can be. Or think of the family whose mother or grandmother no longer recognizes her own children or grandchildren because of Alzheimer's disease. 
These diseases take their toll emotionally as well as financially. They can dramatically and irretrievably alter the lives of the affected individuals and their families, as Senator Mack has so eloquently testified. Therefore, I am very pleased to be joining Senator Mack in offering this sense-of-the-Senate amendment, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us in passing it.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Family Friendly Workplace Act, which will permit employers to offer more flexible work schedules to their employees. 
The lifestyles of today's employees do not always match the traditional 9 to 5, 5-day-a-week schedules of their parents. This legislation is intended to give families greater flexibility in order to better balance the often competing demands of work and family. 
The legislation will allow private sector employers to offer more flexible work schedules to their employees by providing additional options like comptime, flextime, and biweekly schedules. The legislation doesn't change to amount of compensation--simply the form of compensation. 
For instance, the legislation allows employers to give their employees the option of receiving overtime in the form of compensatory time off instead of cash wages at a rate of not less than one and one-half hours for each hour of overtime worked. 
The legislation also allows employers and employees--by mutual agreement--to set up a biweekly schedule consisting of any combination of 80 hours over a 2-week period. For example, an employee could work 45 hours in week one and 35 hours in week two, which would allow them to work nine hours a day and take every other Friday off. 
In response to the concerns expressed by my Democratic colleagues, I also want to emphasize that participation in these programs is strictly voluntary on the part of both the employee and the employer. No one can be forced to participate, nor can participation be a `condition of employment.' In fact, employers are expressly prohibited from coercing, threatening, or intimidating their employees into participating against their will, and violators face a range of sanctions. 
Mr. President, for many families, time is more valuable than money, and this bill simply extends options that have been widely available--and extremely popular among employees--in the public sector to the private sector. 
I have been a manager in the public sector, and I know firsthand how popular and effective these options can be. As former Representative Geraldine Ferraro said during the House debate on the bill allowing Federal agencies to offer flextime and biweekly work schedules, `Flexible schedules have helped reduce the conflicts between work and personal needs, particularly for working women and others with household responsibilities.' I certainly agree with former Representative Ferraro on this issue. 
Finally, Mr. President, I bring to my colleagues' attention a very recent study of over 1,100 women conducted by the Princeton Survey Research. Of the mothers surveyed, 91 percent--91 percent--of those surveyed said that a flexible work schedule was important to them. In fact, the ability to work a flexible work schedule was more important to these working women than the availability of workplace child care or the ability to work part time. 
Mr. President, we should listen to the women of America. We should listen to the mothers of America. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. It is prowomen, it is profamily, and it is proemployee. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the substitute offered by the distinguished minority leader and my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, to H.R. 1122, the partial-birth abortion legislation. 
Let me be clear at the outset that I do not favor abortion. Like most women, I do not believe that abortion should be used as a means of contraception, and I am extremely pleased that the incidence of abortion is on the decline in my State of Maine. In fact, it has dropped by more than 43 percent over the past 10 years. 
Moreover, while I respect the right of a woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy during the early stages, even if it is not a choice that I personally would ever make, I am strongly opposed to all late-term abortions that are not necessary to preserve the physical health or the life of the mother. 
Fortunately, these procedures are exceedingly rare in my State where just one abortion involving a fetus 20 weeks or older was recorded in all of 1995. 
We have heard some graphic and extremely disturbing descriptions of the partial-birth-abortion procedure during the debate on this bill. However, all of the procedures used to perform late-term abortions are equally gruesome and horrible and troubling. 
I agree with the minority leader that this debate should not be about one particular method of abortion, but rather should focus on the larger question of under what circumstances should late-term abortions be legally available. My belief is that late-term abortions, whatever the procedure used, should be banned, except in those rare cases where the life or the physical health of the mother is at serious risk. 
In my view, Congress is not well equipped to make judgments on specific medical procedures. As the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists has said:  
The intervention of legislative bodies into medical decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill-advised and dangerous. 
Most politicians have neither the training nor the experience to decide which procedure is most appropriate in any given case. These medically difficult and highly personal decisions should be left for families to make in consultation with their doctors. 
While I do not believe that it is appropriate for us to dictate medical practice, I do believe that Congress does have an appropriate duty to consider the circumstances under which access to abortion by any procedure should be restricted. 
The Supreme Court, in Roe versus Wade, has set certain parameters for our task by identifying `viability'--the point at which the fetus is capable of sustaining life outside the womb with or without life support as the defining point in determining the constitutionality of restrictions on abortion. 
The amendment we are proposing today goes beyond S. 6 which simply prohibits a medical procedure and will not prevent a single abortion. I think that is a point that has been missed frequently in this debate. By contrast, the Daschle-Snowe substitute would prohibit the abortion of any viable fetus by any method unless the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the mother or to prevent grievous injury to her physical health. 
Mr. President, some have expressed concern that providing a general exception for the health of the mother creates too large a loophole, that it will allow late-term abortions to be performed simply because the mother is depressed or feeling stressed by the pregnancy. I share this concern. I completely agree. And that is why I opposed the amendment offered by the Senators from California, and it is why I have worked so hard to carefully and tightly limit the exception in this amendment to grievous injury to the mother's physical health. 
`Grievous injury' is narrowly and strictly defined by the amendment as either a `severely debilitating disease or impairment specifically caused by the pregnancy' or an `inability to provide necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition.' Moreover, grievous injury does not include any condition that is not medically diagnosable or any condition for which the termination of the pregnancy is not medically indicated. This language is far more restrictive, and rightly so, than the broad `health' exception debated earlier. 
Mr. President, we are not talking about healthy mothers aborting healthy fetuses in the final weeks of pregnancy. We are not talking about hypothetical examples developed by rogue doctors as excuses for performing abortions. What we are talking about are the severe medically diagnosable threats to a woman's physical health that are sometimes brought on or aggravated by pregnancy. Let me give my colleagues a few examples. 
Primary pulmonary hypertension, which can cause sudden death or intractable congestive heart failure; 
Severe pregnancy-aggravated hypertension with accompanying kidney or liver failure; 
Complications from aggravated diabetes, such as amputation or blindness; 
Or an inability to treat aggressive cancers, such as leukemia, breast cancer, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma. 
These are all conditions that are cited in the medical literature as possible indications for pregnancy terminations. In these rare cases, I believe that we should leave the very difficult decisions about what should be done to the best judgment of the women, their families, and the physicians involved. 
Mr. President, last month, after weeks of heated debate and discussion, the Maine State legislature rejected a bill to ban partial-birth abortions. 
During the course of that emotional debate--and this was a very difficult and agonizing debate for all of us--Republican Senator Betty Lou Mitchell of Etna, ME, talked about the decision her daughter-in-law faced 12 years ago. Well into her much-wanted pregnancy, at more than 5 months, the expectant mother learned that her fetus was seriously brain damaged and could not live in the world for more than a few months. Moreover, she was told that carrying the baby to term would prevent her from ever having another child. Faced with this devastating news, she made the heartwrenching decision to terminate the much-wanted pregnancy. 
Maine State minority leader Jane Amero told me of a similar experience of a friend's daughter who suffered an extremely serious infection very late in her pregnancy. If she had not terminated that pregnancy, this young woman, who very much wanted to be a mother, would have been left sterile at the age of 25. 
The stories told by these two Maine State senators revealed the reality behind the rhetoric in this highly charged emotional debate. Thankfully, most of us here will never face such wrenching decisions. But we know that there are women who do. And the question is, whether this highly personal choice, under such difficult and tragic medical circumstances, should be made by these women and their families or by the Federal Government. 
In my judgment, the substitute before us will ensure that 
late-term abortions are severely limited and limited to only those rare and tragic cases where the life or the physical health of the mother is in serious jeopardy. I urge adoption of the substitute.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, during this past weekend, 14 students from St. Dominic Regional High School in Lewiston, ME, joined with almost 1,200 other high school students from across the Nation to participate in the national finals for the `We the People' competition, a program designed to help students better understand the history of our Constitution and its Bill of Rights, which are the foundations upon which our system of government rests. 
The St. Dominic High School students have been representing the State of Maine during this weekend's activities, which will culminate in a national winner being chosen tonight, at an awards banquet here in Washington. The St. Dominic's team spent a considerable amount of time and energy reaching the national finals this weekend by winning various competitions in Maine in order to earn the honor of representing our State. 
The 14 members of our State's outstanding team, who should be individually acknowledged for their efforts in this undertaking, are: 
Robyn Adair, Michael Beam, Julie Blanchette, Nicole Bouttenot, Rachel Bouttenot, Martin Bruno, Derek Coulombe, Emma Dore-Hark, Jennifer Elliott, Jonathan LaBonte, Kendra LaRoche, Kathryn Mailhot, Michael Theriault, and Matthew Walton. 
Of course, in addition to these outstanding students, I want to acknowledge and recognize the hard work of their teacher, Rosanne Ducey, who deserves her fair share of the credit for the team's success as well. The `We the People' program coordinator for Maine, Pamela Beal, has also contributed a significant amount of her time and effort to help the St. Dominic team reach the national finals. 
The `We the People' program, which is administered by the Center for Civic Education, is the most indepth educational program in the country developed specifically to educate high school students about the U.S. Constitution. This past weekend's 3-day national competition re-creates a public hearing in which the student's oral presentations are judged on the basis of their knowledge of constitutional principles and their ability to apply them to historical and contemporary issues. 
The `We the People' program has been operating for 10 years now. Since its origination, millions of students nationwide have participated in this program at either the elementary, middle, and/or high school level. This program provides an excellent opportunity for students to gain an informed perspective on the significance of the U.S. Constitution and its place in our history and our lives. 
Mr. President, I'm pleased to be able to recognize the valuable contribution that the St. Dominic Regional High School team has made to the success of the `We the People' program, and I wish these students and their teachers the very best of luck. I am proud of their accomplishments.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am proud to be introducing the Family Business and Family Farm Preservation Act of 1997, which will provide urgently needed estate tax relief to our Nation's family-owned businesses and farms. It is no accident that this is my first bill as a Member of the U.S. Senate, for I fervently believe that small, family enterprises hold the key to our economic growth and prosperity and that Government policies must promote and not undermine their continued existence. 
Simply put, the extremely high estate tax rates make it very difficult for many families to pass their businesses on to the next generation--the very opposite of what Government policy should be. After allowing for what is essentially a $600,000 exemption, an amount which has not been increased in a decade, the marginal rates that effectively apply for estate tax purposes range from 37 to 55 percent, higher than any other generally applicable Federal tax rates. Adding insult to injury, some of what we leave to our children has already been subject to income taxation, and the combined effect of income and estate taxes can be a tax bite as high as 73 percent. 
It should come as no surprise that when a family business or farm is left to the sons and daughters of the owner, the estate often lacks the cash to pay the tax. A 1995 Gallup survey found that one-third of the owners of family businesses expect that some or all of the company will have to be sold to satisfy estate tax liabilities. That this actually comes about is reflected in the experience of the inheritors of such businesses, 37 percent of whom reported that they had to shrink or restructure the enterprises solely to meet estate tax obligations. 
Mr. President, behind these statistics are the stories of hard-working Americans whose life's work is dismantled by a confiscatory tax. One of those stories was recently told to me by Judy Vallee of Cumberland, ME. In 1933, her father opened a restaurant in Portland and worked hard over time to expand the business into a chain of 25 restaurants along the east coast. When the father died in 1977, the family was left with a staggering estate tax bill of about $1 
million. Lacking the cash to pay the tax, they had to take on partners outside the family, totally restructure the company, and arrange to pay the tax in installments. Unfortunately, even these measures were not enough, and they ultimately had to liquidate the business at fire-sale prices. 
Ironically, Judy Vallee now finds herself in the very same situation, but this time as a business owner and not a potential heir. When the original business was liquidated, she managed to purchase one of the restaurants in her own name, which she has now developed into a prosperous enterprise. Eager to leave the restaurant to her son and desperate to ensure that history does not repeat itself, she has spent a small fortune on life insurance to enable her son to enjoy the fruits of her own hard work. 
Mr. President, jobs are the primary worry of Maine people, and often overlooked in this debate is the negative effect of the estate tax on employment. Let me give you an example. A potato bag manufacturer in northern Maine, the area I'm originally from, has told me that he would be able to expand his operation and hire more people were it not for the money he has to spend on estate planning and life insurance. In another instance, the owner of a Maine trucking company made the painful decision to sell the business to a large, out-of-state corporation rather than leaving it to his children and forcing them to assume a large debt to pay the estate tax. Not only was he compelled to abandon what he and his father before him had spent their lives building, but making matters worse, the new corporate owner moved the administrative operations out of State, costing Maine 50 good jobs. 
Maine's experience is common throughout our Nation. The Gallup survey found that 60 percent of business owners reported that they would add to their work forces were it not for the estate tax. Two studies mentioned in a Wall Street Journal editorial last month quantified the job losses caused by this levy--one put it at 150,000 and the other at 228,000. In a word, the harm is widespread. 
My bill would give relief to small businesses. It would raise the amount effectively excluded from the tax from $600,000 to $1,000,000, which probably does little more than compensate for inflation during the past decade. While $600,000 understandably seems like a considerable sum, the fact is that many small businesses require investment in complex or heavy equipment which 
easily exceeds that threshold. Referring to a machine essential to his business, the owner of a Maine sawmill recently asked me, `What are my sons supposed to do? Sell the debarker to pay the tax?' There is no justification for this legal Catch 22, under which the second- or third-generation business owner can only pay the tax by selling assets essential to running the business. 
My legislation would also lower the effective tax rate for the next $1.5 million from 55 to 27.5 percent and would increase from 10 to 20 years the time during which family businesses could pay the tax on an installment basis. 
These measures are not designed to provide relief to large enterprises. Rather, the beneficiaries, Mr. President, will be enterprising Americans, many of whom risk their life savings and work at their factories, mills, offices, and farms 7 days a week to build a small business, with the reasonable expectation that their Government will let them pass it along to their children. 
Prior to becoming a Member of the Senate, I ran Husson College's Family Business Center in Bangor, ME. I would share with you two lessons I learned from that experience. First, those family business owners who understand the estate tax cannot comprehend why the Federal Government imposes a tax that undermines the very type of activity it says it wishes to encourage. Second, many small business owners do not take the extreme measures required to prepare for the estate tax, often with devastating and totally unexpected consequences for their families. 
Why do I call these measures extreme? In the Gallup survey, the respondents estimated spending an average of more than $33,000 over 6 1/2 years on lawyers, accountants, and financial experts to help plan and prepare for the estate tax. The cost is not only monetary, for the average number of hours spent in the planning process was 167. 
As currently designed, the estate tax represents bad public policy. In my State, it is the 30,000 small businesses, many of them family owned, which provide most of the new employment opportunities, and it is these businesses which will account for two- thirds of the new jobs in the future. By discouraging the development and expansion of family enterprises, the estate tax stands as the enemy of job creation and economic growth. 
Mr. President, it is time for our actions to match our rhetoric. If we believe in promoting family businesses, as we say we do, and if we believe in promoting family farms, as we say we do, we must change a tax policy which takes the family out of the family business and family farm. Mine is not a call for Government assistance or for special treatment. Mine is a call to reform an unfair, destructive, and confiscatory tax.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks on the sense-of-the-Senate resolution before us today, I would like to express my appreciation to my colleagues, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and Senator Wyden of Oregon, who joined me in introducing this measure earlier this week. 
I am also very grateful for the fact that a number of Senators from both sides of the aisle have subsequently expressed their support for this effort by cosponsoring this resolution. 
I would like to finally thank Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy, the chairman and ranking minority members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who have very graciously allowed us to bring this resolution to the Senate floor quickly while the 1997 U.S. Senate Youth Program delegates are still here in Washington visiting. 
Senate Resolution 60 pays tribute to the 3,600 students who have participated in the U.S. Senate Youth Program over the last 35 years. 
Under this program, which has been very successfully administered by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, two students from every State of the Nation, the District of Columbia, and the Department of Defense schools abroad are selected to spend a week right here in Washington learning about their Federal Government. 
Typically, each year the delegates meet with Senators, Representatives, Supreme Court Justices, Cabinet members, White House personnel, and other officials, and have the opportunity to ask them questions directly and to offer comments or concerns on current events. 
Earlier this week, I had the pleasure of addressing the 1997 delegates. It was a very enjoyable and memorable event for me for two reasons. First, the questions and the comments raised by the delegates were both timely and insightful. Their knowledge was impressive and their enthusiasm contagious. 
Second, I have the honor and the privilege of being the first Senate youth delegate who has gone on to actually serve in the Senate. I still remember vividly when I visited Washington, DC, in the spring of 1971, more than 25 years ago. We met with various Representatives and Senators, including my colleagues, Senator Robert Byrd and Senator Strom Thurmond, both of whom I am now privileged to serve with in this body. In fact, I brought out my journal and I read my notes on both Senators' speeches to us, and it was a wonderful experience to reread and relive that week. 
The high point of my visit, however, was the time that I was fortunate to spend with Maine's Senator Margaret Chase Smith. She was very much an inspiration and a role model for me and countless other girls growing up in Maine and young women throughout the Nation who aspire to public service. 
While I am the first Senate youth delegate to serve in the Senate, I fully expect that there will be other delegates who will serve one day in the House, the Senate, on the Supreme Court, in the Cabinet, and even as President of the United States. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution, which recognizes the value of this program, salutes the individual students who have participated in it, and commends the William Randolph Hearst Foundation for its generous sponsorship over the years. 
At this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, that the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution appear at this point in the Record.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of Charlene Barshefsky to be the next United States Trade Representative. In representing a State with a long history of trade with Canada, I have taken particular interest in President Clinton's nominee for USTR. 
I have had serious concerns about this administration's lack of aggressiveness in pursuing the concerns of Maine's farmers and businesses regarding unfair trade practices by neighboring Canada. Canada is Maine's No. 1 trading partner, and Mainers value this relationship, but we want it to be a fair relationship. When evidence is found that trading practices are not fair, the United States needs to take strong and effective action. 
To underscore my concern about this problem, I withheld my support for Ambassador Barshefsky until I had an opportunity to meet with her to discuss several trade issues important to the people of my State. Farmers, fishermen, and others in natural resource industries have long been concerned about unfair trade practices by the Canadian Government. 
Maine potato farmers, in particular, have labored under trade practices that have threatened the very survival of some farms. Particularly troubling are apparent subsidies from the Canadian Government that allow Canadian farmers to sell their products at artificially low prices, thus enabling Canadian farmers to dump large volumes of potatoes into the American market. At the same time, there is concern that Canadians may be erecting trade barriers that make it difficult for our farmers to sell their products in Canada. 
We cannot continue to tolerate Canadian trading practices that adversely affect Maine potato farmers, who have seen more than their share of hard times. However, I am encouraged by Ambassador Barshefsky's recent actions, which include asking the International Trade Commission to undertake an investigation to determine the nature and extent of Canadian potato subsidies. This is a step in the right direction and a good sign that these issues will finally get the attention they deserve. But it is only a first step. It is critical that the administration follow through and take action to assure a level playing field. 
Another issue I raised with the Ambassador was the frustration of some Maine shellfish companies with newly instituted inspection fees on shellfish products exported to Canada. Maine shellfish exporters have been concerned that the Canadians are unfairly targeting their products for inspection in an attempt to make it more difficult for Maine shellfish to be shipped to Canada. On this issue I found the Ambassador to be very responsive. She has been helpful with gathering information, and I am pleased USTR officials have begun meetings with their Canadian counterparts to review these onerous fees. 
Finally, I also raised the issue, which the distinguished Senator from South Carolina has talked about, and that is the issue of the U.S. tariffs on capacitors. As part of the Information Technology Agreement negotiated in Singapore last year, the administration agreed to a European proposal to eliminate the current 9 percent tariff on capacitors entering the United States. Under the agreement, the tariff would be eliminated in July of this year. 
The elimination of this tariff could pose a serious hardship on several American companies, one of which is in my State of Maine. The Ambassador and I discussed this hardship, and I made the case that the industry was unaware of even the potential that this tariff could be eliminated. I asked what measures could be taken to provide some relief. 
I was impressed with the Ambassador's knowledge on this issue, and I was very encouraged by a commitment she made to me to find middle ground with the Europeans that would give American manufacturers of capacitors more time to adjust to a tariff elimination. 
Specifically, we talked about the possibility of having a phaseout of the tariff, rather than the abrupt elimination in July. 
In closing, I would like to address the issue of the need to waive a provision passed last Congress as part of the lobbying disclosure act. This provision prohibits the appointment of any person who has represented a foreign government in a trade dispute with the United States from serving as USTR or deputy USTR. Like many of my colleagues, I was very concerned about the need to exempt someone from a law that is on the books and has been passed so recently. Since the foreign country involved is Canada, I was particularly concerned because of the contentious trading relationship that my State has had over the years with Canada on many important products. However, after addressing this issue with Ambassador Barshefsky, I learned that she was previously exempted from this provision in her capacity as deputy USTR. It, therefore, does seem reasonable to me to allow this waiver to follow her into her new duties as USTR, and I agree with the Finance Committee's unanimous recommendation to waive the law. 
I am pleased to have had the opportunity to meet with Ambassador Barshefsky and her staff to discuss these important issues. They are critical issues to my constituents. I found her to be very knowledgeable and responsive. I am hopeful that her tenure as USTR will bring about renewed interest, commitment and, most of all, action on trade issues confronting the people of Maine. 
I appreciate the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee yielding me time, and I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to urge Senate approval of the balanced budget constitutional amendment. Some have argued that a constitutional amendment is not needed to ensure a balanced budget, but history clearly demonstrates that, despite good intentions, we will not get the job done absent the constitutional requirement. 
Every President during the past two decades has pledged to balance the budget. In 1970, President Nixon said that he would recommend a balanced budget by 1971. President Ford pledged to achieve a balanced budget in 1976. In 1978, President Carter pledged to move rapidly toward a balanced budget. In 1983, President Reagan talked of achieving a balanced budget by the end of the decade. The list goes on and on. 
The simple fact is that the road to our huge national debt has been paved with good intentions. The old saying that `we have met the enemy and it is us' has never been more applicable. 
I know the pressures on Washington to spend money, even borrowed money. By and large, each Congress sets out to be fiscally responsible, but our national debt still grows. The truth is that experience has taught us that even in good times, we need the discipline of a constitutional amendment. 
Thank you, Madam President.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, along with Senator Hutchison and Senator Wyden, I am pleased to submit this resolution to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the William Randolph Hearst U.S. Senate Youth Program. As the first graduate of the program to become a U.S. Senator, I can honestly say that the week I spent in Washington in 1971, as one of two delegates from Maine, profoundly influenced my life and career. 
Even though my family has a long and proud tradition of public service-- my great grandfather, my grandfather and my father all served in the State legislature, and both of my parents served as mayor of Caribou, ME--it was a week I spent in Washington with the Senate Youth Program that caused me to seriously consider a career in the public sector. 
For the past 35 years, the Senate Youth Program has selected two of the brightest and most active students in each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Department of Defense schools abroad to spend a week learning about our Nation's government first-hand. Over the years, 3,600 such students have participated in the program and gone on to serve our Nation in various capacities, including public service. 
Monday morning, I had the pleasure of addressing this year's delegates and was impressed with their enthusiasm, knowledge, and the high caliber of the questions they posed. I was delighted to see how the program has maintained--perhaps even surpassed--the high standards for which it is so well known. 
The continued generosity of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation enables students to come to the District of Columbia and see a side of government that few Americans see in their lifetime. Each year the delegates meet with top members of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. 
I remember how fascinated I was as a delegate to listen to Senators Byrd and Thurmond speak to us about the history of the Senate and the issues of the day. 
But the highlight of my week was the time I spent talking with my home State Senator, Margaret Chase Smith. I went to Senator Smith's office hoping to shake her hand; instead, she took me into her private office and spent 2 hours talking with me about the importance of public service and the difference one person can make. When I left her office, I remember feeling so proud that she was my Senator and that I could do anything I set my mind to. 
So, today it is my pleasure to sponsor this resolution paying tribute to the 3,600 delegates who have participated in the Senate Youth Program over the past 35 years, some of whom we may see here in the Congress, the Supreme Court, or even the White House in years to come. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to those of my distinguished colleagues who have spoken in favor of a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
It is not surprising that with a national debt which is $5.3 trillion and still growing this debate is awash in statistics, each more staggering than the last. As someone who ran for office to fight for more opportunities and better jobs, I find the costs in those areas of our chronic failure to balance the budget to be particularly troubling. 
In light of the President's call for a crusade for education, one of the more telling statistics is that last year the Federal Government spent about $240 billion to service our national debt, an amount that is almost eight times greater than the amount we spent on education. Think about that. If we had been operating the Government without debt, we could have spent nine times more on educating our children. Now, that is what I call a crusade. 
Whatever the long-term benefits to the public sector from balancing the budget, they pale in comparison to the benefits to our families. The Concord Coalition has estimated that had we not run deficits for the past two decades, the average family's annual income would be $15,500 higher. Looked at prospectively, the General Accounting Office has said that we will increase per capita income by 26 percent over the next two decades if we balance our budget. 
These are not partisan statistics, just as this is not a partisan issue. The numbers I have cited to demonstrate the enormous costs of our past fiscal failures can be found in a recent letter to the editor from former Democratic Senator Paul Simon, a leader in the battle for a constitutional amendment, whose 22 years of congressional service ended before the goal to which he was so deeply committed could become a reality. 
The economic evidence that favors a balanced budget is overwhelming. But one legitimately may ask how I make the jump from the need for a balanced budget to the need for a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget. That is a political not an economic issue but the evidence is equally as overwhelming. 
The simple fact is that the road to our huge national debt has been paved with good intentions. We have had the Deficit Reduction Act, the Gramm-Rudman Act, the Budget Enforcement Act, and yet we still have deficits. The old saying that `We have met the enemy and it is us' has never been more applicable. 
As a freshman Senator, I do not sit in judgment on my predecessors and say that I would have done it differently. I know the pressures on Washington to spend money, even borrowed money. By and large, each Congress sets out to be fiscally responsible, 
but our national debt still grows. The truth is experience has taught us that even in good times we need the discipline of a constitutional amendment. 
To those who say that this issue does not rise to the level of constitutional protection, I respectfully disagree. It is the unique genius of the U.S. Constitution that serves to protect our people and their property from the excesses of their Government. It is difficult to imagine a greater excess, at least in the realm of property, than a debt burden of more than $5 trillion. The legacy we are leaving our children and our grandchildren, many of them not yet born, is taxation without representation in its most egregious form. 
As I said earlier, this is a debate in which there has been no shortage of statistics and no shortage of speeches, but buried somewhere beneath that pile of numbers and mounds of rhetoric is a very simple principle. That is that all of us, including the Congress of the United States, must be personally responsible for our actions. In the context of the budget, personal responsibility means not spending what is not ours to spend. 
The 104th Congress struck a strong blow for personal responsibility in its welfare legislation. It told able-bodied welfare recipients that they could not live off the efforts of others; that they would have to earn their own way. For those who grew up in a culture of dependency, this was a harsh message. But it was the right message because responsibility for one's own actions is the core of the American effort. 
I think it important that the Congress and the President not hold themselves to any less of a standard of personal responsibility. During the past quarter century, a culture of dependency has developed right here in the U.S. Congress, and it is reflected in our dependency on the money of future generations. In each of the past 27 years, we have borrowed from our children and our grandchildren to buy things for ourselves, building up an immense debt with no end in sight. 
The legacy we are leaving, however, is not just financial. It is a legacy of excess, of taking advantage of those who cannot protect their own interests, of practicing not deferred gratification but, rather, deferred responsibility. 
I recognize that deficits are sometimes unavoidable and that, indeed, they are sometimes critical to finance wars or to get the economy moving out of a recession. The balanced budget amendment would still permit deficit spending in the event of war, recession, or other emergency, but deficit spending today is no longer a tool carefully used by Congress and the President to respond to emergencies. Rather, it has become a permanent feature of our fiscal landscape. 
Just how permanent deficit spending has become is reflected in the staggering fact that if every man, woman, and child in this Nation brought all of their currency to Washington, DC, it would not be enough to pay off our national debt. Those who argue that we do not need a constitutional amendment to solve this problem are simply ignoring our fiscal history. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise to address my colleagues for the first time from the floor of the U.S. Senate, the world's greatest deliberative body. I am honored to be standing where once stood Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who was such an inspiration to me as a young girl growing up in Caribou, ME. 
In all of history, only 26 women have served in the Senate, only 15 of us elected in our own right. I am especially proud that my home State is the first to send two Republican women to serve in the Senate at the same time. And I am very pleased to be sharing that honor with my colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe. 
During my youth, the people of Maine were fortunate to have an inspiring example of a woman who stood tall for her principles and for her State. As a Senator from 1949 to 1972, Margaret Chase Smith taught us that women could reach the highest levels of government and that hard work, common sense, and integrity are rewarded. 
Equally important, Senator Smith taught us how to govern. She recognized it is only through civil discourse and a spirit of cooperation that the people's business gets done. And she showed us all, through her deeds as well as her words, that there is a difference between the principle of compromise and the compromise of principle. Compromising one's principles is wrong. Compromising on how to achieve those principles is the essence of a healthy democracy. 
Each of us is called to serve, and the different ways in which we are called form the fabric of this great Nation. Some are called to heal and become doctors and nurses. Others are called to impart wisdom to the next generation and become teachers. Others are called to work in the businesses, large and small, that provide the products and services that enrich our daily lives. Still others are called to be the entrepreneurs who create the jobs that keep this country at the forefront of the world's economy. 
With a father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and great-great-grandfather who all served in the Maine Legislature, I heard the call to public service at an early age. And that call was not limited to the men in my family, as my mother served as head of the local school board, as mayor of Caribou, and as the chair of the board of trustees of Maine's State university system. With my family background, no greater honor could be bestowed upon me than to represent the people of Maine in the U.S. Senate. 
In undertaking my duties as Senator, Mr. President, I come to Washington not as an enemy of government but as one committed to improving it. We need a vigorous debate in this country about the role of government, a reassessment of what it can and cannot do. There are some problems that only the Federal Government has the resources and the authority to address, but many times the answers are found not in Washington but in our neighborhoods, our communities, our States, and ultimately in ourselves. 
If there is one change in government on which we should all be able to agree, it is that we need to start to be more forthright with the American people about the difficult challenges facing us. A well-known Maine business sells hunting boots, and if you buy a pair of them you can be confident they will withstand the test of time. Take them apart and you will understand why. They contain no bells or whistles. If our Federal budget were as honestly constructed as a pair of Maine boots, future taxpayers could sleep as well as Maine woodsmen. 
In assessing the role of government, we must never forget that the great advances we have made over the years can ultimately be traced to the energy and creativity of our citizens. Indeed, perhaps the most profound change in political thought around the globe during the past two decades has been the recognition that there is usually a correlation between less government and more progress. 
Government must foster the energy and creativity of our private sector. As Winston Churchill once said, `Some see private enterprise as a predatory target to be shot, others as a cow to be milked, but few see it as a sturdy horse pulling the wagon.' I do see private enterprise as that sturdy horse, and in that wagon which it is pulling are the jobs that are so critical to all of our constituents. 
Wherever I travel in Maine, the primary concern of the people is jobs. In the past, they were worried about whether jobs would be there for their children and their grandchildren. Today, they are worried about their own jobs as well--some about getting jobs and many more about keeping the ones that they have. We live in the midst of an exciting and dynamic technological revolution, but it is accompanied by widespread anxiety about our futures. One need only visit with former mill workers in Millinocket or Biddeford, ME, to understand that fear. 
To respond to the concerns of our citizens, Government policies must promote job creation and retention, and the starting point is small business. 
In my State, it is the 30,000 small businesses that provide most of the new employment opportunities, and it is small businesses that will account for two-thirds of the new jobs in the next decade. 
Even though small businesses provide the spark that ignites many of the new ideas that benefit us all, Government policies often serve to inhibit rather than foster these enterprises. A glaring example is the onerous estate tax that deters families from passing on a successful business from one generation to the next. An owner of such a business in Maine once told me that he made the painful decision to sell his family business to a large out-of-State corporation rather than leave it to his children and force them to assume a large debt to pay the Federal estate tax. He was forced to abandon what he and his father before him had spent their lives building. Making matters worse, the new corporate owner consolidated its administrative operations out of State, costing Maine more than 50 good jobs. That is wrong. That is the kind of policy we must change. 
If excessive taxes cause the downfall of some enterprises, others are done in by unreasonable regulations. This occurred in Lubec, ME, located in one of the most beautiful but also one of the poorest parts of my State. During my Senate campaign, I toured the empty shell of the McCurdy Fish Co., a family owned business that had operated in Lubec for more than 90 years, providing 20 good, much-needed jobs to this area. It was closed down by new Federal regulations with which it simply could not afford to comply. Adding insult to injury, just across the border the company's Canadian competitor continued processing fish in the same manner as had the Lubec company and exported its product into the United States, free from these expensive regulations. 
Mr. President, another essential step to promoting an economic climate that creates jobs is balancing the Federal budget. It has been estimated that a balanced budget would reduce interest rates by more than 1 percent, a strong stimulus for growth and employment. 
To ensure long-term prosperity, we must learn to live within our means. Not since 1969 has this Nation seen a balanced budget. More than 25 years of skyrocketing spending and an unwillingness to make sacrifices have ballooned our debt to more than $5.2 trillion. We must act now or leave a legacy of crushing debt to the next generation. At the rate we are going, we may cross that bridge to the 21st century, only to arrive in a land of unkept promises and unpaid bills. 
To avoid this fate, one of my top priorities will be to pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. History shows that it will take a constitutional requirement for Congress to embrace fiscal responsibility as a permanent obligation rather than as a passing fad. 
Fiscal responsibility also means Medicare and Social Security must be placed on a sound financial footing. Only through effective action on these fronts will we be able to keep our promises to our seniors without bankrupting our children. 
A third key to jobs is quality education. The fruits of the new age in which we live will be shared by most of our citizens only if the doors of opportunity are open wide. Contrary to what some would have you believe, we do not face a choice between the greed of a few and the well-being of the many. Rather, we need policies that will ensure that when an entrepreneur drops the stone of innovation into the technological pool, the benefits ripple throughout society. Government cannot and should not assure equality of outcomes. But without equality of opportunity, the American dream is unfairly denied. 
The reality of today's workplace is that 85 percent of the new jobs will require some sort of post-secondary education, whether that be a community college, a technical or vocational education, or a bachelor's degree and beyond. We must do what we can to open the doors to a post-secondary education for anyone who wants it, and to ensure that cost is not the barrier that separates those who pursue higher education from those who do not. Increasingly, we 
are finding that the growing gap between the rich and the poor in this Nation is an education gap. 
A final element in achieving broad-based participation in the new American-led industrial and technological revolution is fair trade. The primary victims of unfair trading practices are workers, particularly those with the fewest skills and the least education. Let me be clear: I am a strong advocate of free trade, but we cannot sustain majority support for that policy unless we take a strong stand against unfair practices. 
While mine is a message of jobs and opportunity, I know that there are those who, through no fault of their own, are unable to get by without help from their government. Hubert Humphrey once said, `the moral test of a government is how * * * [it] * * * treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life--the sick, the needy and the handicapped.' As we go about the difficult task of balancing the budget, of choosing among many worthwhile programs, we must take care not to leave behind those who truly need our help. 
Those are the principles upon which my vision of the future of America is based. And I bring one other principle to this body, one which will guide me more than any other as I embark upon this exciting journey, and that is a steadfast commitment to the people of Maine. Whether it is fighting for Maine's fair share of Federal contracts, urging a business to expand and create jobs in our State, or helping a constituent navigate the bureaucratic maze in order to receive veterans' benefits, it will be service to the people of my State that will be my highest priority as Maine's newest Senator. 
Just 1 year ago, I stood in Bangor, ME, with my family and my friends at my side, and announced my intention to seek a seat in the U.S. Senate. I told the people of Maine then that I would represent them with dignity and determination, with energy and enthusiasm. My approach will be simple and straightforward: I will listen to all points of view, I will engage in constructive dialog with my colleagues, I will compromise when compromise is warranted, but, after all is said and done, I will fight for those changes that will make the Federal Government better able to serve the people of Maine. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is a tremendous honor to be able to cast my second vote as a U.S. Senator to confirm my friend and mentor, Senator Bill Cohen, as this Nation's Secretary of Defense. 
In describing the characteristics that make Senator Cohen so well qualified for this job, it would be presumptuous and unnecessary for me to detail his expertise in defense matters to his former colleagues in the Senate. Most of you have worked closely with him on defense issues for many years, and all of you are certainly aware of the depth of his knowledge and experience in this arena. Simply put, Bill Cohen's understanding of the complexities of defense policy is unassailable. 
But I do want to attest personally to Bill Cohen's integrity and character, and on that basis there is simply no one more qualified for this enormous responsibility. Bill Cohen embodies the patriotism, the thoughtfulness, the steadfastness, and the intellect that the task of overseeing our Nation's security requires. He brings to the job a fierce dedication to his principles, a level-headed ability to never make a rash or uninformed decision, and the desire to make the Nation's defense stronger while at the same time making it more effective and more efficient. 
Most important of all, Bill Cohen will never put Americans troops at risk unnecessarily. In every decision involving the deployment of our men and women in uniform, he will see the faces of our troops, not just the statistics and logistics. He will bring to the Pentagon the reasoned, thoughtful approach that matters as weighty as war and peace require. 
I have known Bill Cohen for more than 24 years. I first met him when he was running for Congress in 1972, seeking the seat representing Maine's Second District. He was walking more than 600 miles across the sprawling district, introducing himself to the voters. I volunteered to drive the campaign car as he criss-crossed the roads of northern Maine. I was inspired by his determination to meet the people whom he wanted to serve in Washington and by his sincere interest in their hopes and fears. 
I was also impressed then, as I am now, by his commitment to public service, to doing what was best for the people he represented. Over the years, I saw countless examples of that commitment, whether he was representing the people of the Second District as a House Member, or the people of the whole State as a Senator. Now I have no doubt that he will bring the same dedication for public service to a job at the highest levels of public service, one that answers to the largest constituency of all--the Nation. 
In the more than two decades since I first met Bill Cohen, he has been my inspiration, my guide, and my friend. It gives me great pride to be able to be here today to endorse his nomination. I am delighted that the President has made such an outstanding nomination for such a critical Cabinet post. This morning I testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee to urge its prompt and favorable consideration of Bill Cohen's nomination. I am pleased that the committee was able to act so quickly to bring this outstanding nomination to the Senate floor. And I know my colleagues will join me in unanimously approving Bill Cohen's nomination.
