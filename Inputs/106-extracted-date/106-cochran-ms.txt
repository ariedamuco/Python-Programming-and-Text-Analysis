    Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senate will be diminished considerably when one of my favorite U.S. Capitol Police Officers, Andy Anders, retires at the end of this month. 
   When I first met Andy, the day I was sworn in as a Senator, he was one of the so-called Fearless Five. Those were the officers who were stationed just outside the entrance to the Senate chamber near the elevators. That was his post for 19 years. 
   Even though he is called Andy, his real name is Oliver Anders. His hometown is Greer, South Carolina, and the first vote he ever cast was for Senator STROM THURMOND. As you can see, Andy is a man of very good judgment. 
   For the last five years Andy has been assigned to the fourth floor of the Capitol outside the Senate Security spaces. He is one of the most trusted and dependable members of the U.S. Capitol Police force. 
   He is also a well informed student of American history. When I learned he planned to visit my State during his vacation several years ago, I suggested some special sites for him to see in Vicksburg, Natchez and Jackson. My Administrative Assistant, at that time, Wiley Carter, who was also a great friend and admirer of Andy, went with him to the State Capitol and introduced him to the Speaker of the State House of Representatives and other officials and also arranged a tour of the Governor's Mansion. Of course, Andy enjoyed all of this special attention. But, he deserved it. 
   We don't do enough in my opinion for those who work hard and faithfully every day to make the Senate a safe and secure place to work. Since he began his career with the U.S. Capitol Police on November 4, 1974, Oliver Anders has been one of those you could always count on to be at his post, carrying out his important responsibilities, with a smile and kind greeting for all Senators, and their constituents. 
   We will miss him greatly, but we won't forget him or the excellent way he performed his duties. I wish him much happiness and satisfaction in the years ahead.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank Chairman MURKOWSKI, Senator CRAIG THOMAS, and the members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for reporting out and helping Senator Lott and me secure passage of Senate Bill 2638, the Cat Island authorization legislation. When Senator Lott and I introduced the legislation earlier this year, we sought to preserve the beautiful, natural treasure of Cat Island, Mississippi, and complete the vision of the Gulf Islands National Seashore begun nearly 30 years ago. The passage of this legislation begins this process by authorizing the National Park Service to acquire the island and save it for future generations.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, our State officials, and we today, acknowledge that the Gulf Islands National Seashore should be preserved and protected as a place of relatively undeveloped natural beauty, and that does involve limitations on minerals development but not a reinterpretation by the Park Service of the ownership of these mineral rights. These rights are important to Mississippi and may offer our State in the future much needed income to address education, health care and other priorities for our citizens.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Yes, the managers intend that the Secretary of Agriculture fully implement section 804 which provides authority to compensate growers for crop losses due to new and emergent pests and diseases: including Mexican fruit flies, plum pox virus, Pierce's disease, grasshoppers and Mormon crickets, and watermelon sudden wilt disease. Senator LUGAR, as you noted, section 804 is designed to provide compensation to growers for crop losses due to several new and emergent pests and diseases, none of which may necessarily be a weather-related problem. Full implementation of section 804 is necessary for growers to receive compensation for these various problems.

   Mr. COCHRAN. I understand the challenges facing California's growers. The Administration's budget request of $31.91 million for the Program earmarks only $300,000 for equipment and maintenance of the State's Preventive Release Program. The fiscal year 2001 Agriculture appropriations bill provides $32.61 million for the Fruit Fly Exclusion and Detection Program. The $700,000 above the Administration's request is to be used to enhance the release program and detection trapping in California.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the conference report includes funding for American Heritage Rivers program under the Conservation Operations and Watershed Surveys and Planning accounts of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS. Funding for this program is limited to that requested in the President's budget. It is my understanding that there are communities which are in the final stages of being included in the American Heritage Rivers program, including Vicksburg and Natchez, Mississippi. 
   It is not our intention to limit these funds to those communities that were included in the program when the budget was submitted. Further, if additional communities are added during fiscal year 2001, they should be eligible for all funds available for the American Heritage Rivers program. Also, technical assistance can be provided, without limitation, by the NRCS to farmers or communities in an American Heritage River designated area.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the conference report includes a provision that is designed to eliminate an inequity that has arisen regarding a special grade designation of rice known as sweet rice. This rice had been ineligible for price support for some time, but the Department of Agriculture changed the rules in December 1999 to make the 1999 crop eligible for marketing loans and loan deficiency payments for the first time. Unfortunately, producers of this rice had not been notified by the county offices of the crop's eligibility until after the period for obtaining loans and loan deficiency payments had expired. 
   The provision in the conference report is designed to correct this inequity. The provision would extend the eligibility date for such loans and loan deficiency payments and allow producers of such rice who lost beneficial interest in the crop on or before May 31, 2000, the final date for obtaining loans or loan deficiency payment, to obtain a loan deficiency payment based on the payment rate in effect on the date they lost the beneficial interest. Producers who lost the beneficial interest in their production after May 31, 2000 would be eligible to receive a loan deficiency payment based on the payment rate in effect on May 31. The conferees had agreed that this provision was necessary to make whole those producers of the crop who had lost the opportunity to obtain price support through no fault of their own.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, with sections 745 and 746 of this bill, the Congress intends to facilitate access for Americans to reimport U.S.-made prescription medicines, as long as it does not lower the safety standards that previous Congresses and Administrations have carefully developed in consumer, health and safety protection legislation over the years. Under these provisions, Americans are allowed access to U.S. products sold overseas at lower prices provided that those medicines, when reimported, are demonstrated to be safe and effective. 
   At the time the Senate considered this appropriations bill, the Senate adopted an additional safeguard to protect consumer health and safety. By a vote of 96 to 0, the Senate agreed to an amendment which Senator KOHL and I offered to the amendment of Senator JEFFORDS to include the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000 on this bill. That amendment is retained in this conference report, and requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make two determinations before the changes to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, FFDCA, in section 745(c) can be implemented. The Secretary is required to demonstrate to the Congress that implementation will: (1) pose no additional risk to the public's health and safety, and (2) result in a significant reduction in the cost of covered products to the American consumer. 
   As contained in section 745(c), section 804(l) enlists the expertise and conscience of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make a specific and clear demonstration to assure these changes to the law will produce their intended result and do no unintended harm. In a written report to the Congress, the Secretary is to demonstrate the factual basis for his or her decision. That report should include relevant analysis and information that implementation of these changes in law will pose no additional risks to the American public's health and safety and will significantly reduce retail prices. 
   After all, the motivation for these changes in law is to let U.S. drugs be brought back from Canada and other countries where they cost less, allowing these drugs to be available to individual American consumers at lower prices. If reimportation results primarily in profits for importers and does not result in a reduction in the price of drugs to American consumers, then the intent of these provisions is not achieved. 
   I believe that with the additional safeguard provided by the original amendment adopted by the Senate, we can be more assured that this new drug reimportation system, if implemented, will not have adverse unintended effects on public health and safety and will achieve its intended result of making drugs more affordable for individual American consumers.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the comments that have been made by a number of Senators about the development of this legislation and the efforts we have made to negotiate an agreement with the House and bring back this conference report for final consideration by the Senate today. 
   There have been some statements made on the floor today that I think require a response. There was some singling out of individual research projects by the distinguished Senator from Arizona as if these were pork barrel projects. One response has already been made, and that was by the distinguished Senator from Alabama as he talked about some of the specialty crops and specific agricultural and aquacultural activities in his State. He explained the importance of ongoing research initiatives that will help improve the opportunities for agricultural producers to grow those crops and engage in those agricultural and aquacultural pursuits, and to do so profitably, helping to guarantee safe and wholesome supplies of food and food products for people in that State and throughout the country. 
   We have had a very difficult time in agriculture this year, and because of research, we are able to overcome some of those difficulties and provide hope that in these areas of particular stress in agriculture and aquaculture, we will be able to offer better days in the future. 
   A considerable attempt and a determined attempt is made in this legislation to identify ways to help improve the opportunities for U.S. agricultural producers to stay in business, to deal with the problems of drought, of infestation of insects and pests, to deal with the problems of weeds and other threats to efficient operation and production of our agricultural lands. 
   There is nothing wrong with the Government providing Federal funds to help identify better ways of dealing with these problems in agriculture. 
   One other comment that particularly distresses me is the emphasis on criticizing the existing farm bill as if it is the reason farmers are having such a difficult time. 
   I recall several years ago when we first realized that in the Asian economies they were getting to the point where they were no longer able to import from our country agricultural commodities in the quantities that they had in the past because of the economic crisis. Particularly countries such as Korea, Japan, and other Asian economies were suffering--the so-called ``tiger economies'' of Southeast Asia. And to hear today a statement that for several years in a row we have had to adopt agricultural disaster and economic assistance programs because of the Freedom to Farm Act. Have Senators forgotten some of the problems that our agricultural producers and exporters have had to overcome that had absolutely nothing to do with the Freedom to Farm Act but everything to do with a worldwide economic crisis? That is the main problem that agriculture had in the first 2 years of this existing farm bill. 
   To hear some Senators today indicting, again, the Freedom to Farm bill for the results of this year's drought is another new stretch of the imagination and credibility of this institution. Senators know enough not to believe that. 
   The Senator from Alabama was pointing out how in his State the drought problems are the worst in memory--and not just this year but add to the problems that occurred last year--and you understand how serious, how desperate the situation is in agriculture in Alabama this year, to cite one example. It has nothing to do with the Freedom to Farm Act. 
   Many worked very hard to craft the farm bill of 1996, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and in the House--of course, it was not unanimous. But they worked hard to develop the best possible legislation under which we could provide support and rules under which the Federal Government could make available incentives for production agriculture, stabilize prices, and have a predictable level of support from the Federal Government. The bill attempts to avoid the ups and downs, the whims, of one administration or the other, the vicissitudes of a Congress that is unpredictable at best on these matters. The bill prescribed well in advance, over a period of years, the level of assistance for commodity producers that were eligible for benefits--that was the result of that negotiation in the legislation that was produced. 
   And now to lay it all off on that, as if that is the reason for these difficulties, to me, goes too far and deserves a response. It ought to have a response. I am pointing out at least two instances where that indictment and that criticism is just not accurate, it is not supported by the facts, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with this legislation. 
   This legislation includes, however, $3.6 billion in additional assistance of an emergency nature to try to assist those who have had difficulties this year over and above those that were expected. Because of findings made by the Senate and the House and the administration, this justifies emergency  funding, and it is included in this legislation. 
   So I am hopeful and I am confident that the Senate is going to recognize the legitimacy and the importance of adopting this conference report. It reflects a lot of hard work by members of our appropriations subcommittee that developed the legislation, working in a bipartisan fashion, and working with our colleagues in the other body after our bill was passed and we negotiated this conference report with them, to come up with the best possible work product under the circumstances that we find ourselves today. 
   But no matter how much money we appropriate for research, for disaster assistance, for export assistance, trying to help stimulate our sales in overseas markets, we cannot solve all the problems of agriculture by the passage of this one bill. Everybody knows that. But it is a major and important step, and it will benefit a lot of American agricultural producers. 
   There is also more in this bill than just production agriculture assistance, but it is an important aspect of this 
   legislation. This is a $78 billion bill. Nearly $40 billion of the funds relates to agriculture, landowner assistance, research to try to help do the things you have to do to maintain efficiency, understand the new technologies, translate the research from the laboratory to the farm through extension programs so that we have the finest, the most efficient, the most dependable agricultural sector in the world. This bill achieves those goals. 
   We also, at the same time, provide food safety programs, an inspection service that is fully funded, a food safety initiative that is fully funded at the request of the administration, to make sure that we have a wholesome supply of food, and it is fit for consumption by Americans, and it is reasonably priced. 
   We achieve that goal in this legislation. There are many in our country who do not have the benefit of high incomes. We have low-income people who live in poverty areas who need food assistance. This legislation includes school lunch program and school breakfast program funding. It includes Women, Infants, and Children Program funding, Food Stamp Program funding, assistance to soup kitchens, to those who use surplus commodities to provide lunches and meals for people who cannot afford food, so that we do not have people who are out of work and out of food. This legislation provides that important benefit as well. 
   So, on balance, this is a good bill. It deserves the support of the Senate. I hope all Senators will support it.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the majority leader has asked that it be announced that the Senate will resume consideration of the conference report to accompany the Agriculture appropriations bill at 10 a.m. tomorrow. The vote has been changed to occur at 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, with the final 2 hours of debate to take place on Wednesday 2 hours prior to the vote. Senators on both sides of the aisle have requested the vote be changed for various reasons, the most important being the request by the congressional delegation that will be attending the memorial service for the U.S. sailors killed aboard the U.S.S. Cole. That memorial service is to be held at 11 a.m. in Norfolk, VA, thereby making the previously scheduled vote not feasible. 
   As for the remainder of the week, it is hoped that the Senate can complete most, if not all, business necessary for sine die adjournment. Senators should expect votes throughout each day and into the evenings at the end of the week.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to announce to the Senate that we successfully completed action in our conference committee and brought back to the Senate a bill that has already been approved by the other body by a substantial vote of support, and indications are that the President is prepared to sign this conference report. 
   I am pleased to make that announcement because during the development of this legislation and the markup sessions that we held here in the Senate, and discussions of the bill on the floor of the Senate, there were some very contentious and controversial issues that were debated and considered. We didn't achieve all of the successes that Senators wanted to achieve, as is usually the case in the situation where you are negotiating compromise with the other body and dealing with views and opinions reflected in the policies of the administration. But, taken together, given the expressions of support and interest in the Senate for the provisions that are in the bill, I am confident that most Senators will be very pleased with this result. 
   This is a good bill. It deserves the support of the Senate. 
   It provides a restrained approach to funding the activities of the Agencies and Departments of Government that are funded in this bill. 
   The total dollar amount for new budget authority, for example, is less than the fiscal year 2000 enacted level. It is less than the level requested by the President. It is less than the House-passed bill level, and it is less than the Senate-passed bill level. 
   The fact is, every effort was made during consideration of this bill to be restrained and responsible in the allocation of funds that are available to this subcommittee under the budget resolution. 
   The conference agreement provides total new budget authority of $74.5 billion for programs and activities of the United States Department of Agriculture (except for the Forest Service which is funded by the Interior Appropriations bill), the Food and Drug Administration, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This is approximately $1.1 billion less than the fiscal year 2000 enacted level and $2.3 billion less than the level requested by the President. It is $651 million less than the House-passed bill level, and $859 million less than the Senate-passed bill level. 
   This conference report also includes an additional $3.6 billion in emergency appropriations to compensate agricultural producers for losses suffered due to drought, fires, and other natural disasters; to meet conservation needs; and to provide relief to rural communities. 
   Including Congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-year spending actions, this conference agreement provides total non-emergency discretionary spending for fiscal year 2001 of just over $15 billion in budget authority and outlays. 
   I am pleased to report that this conference report provides funding at the President's request level, an increase of nearly $58 million from the fiscal year 2000 level, for activities and programs in this bill which are part of the Administration's ``Food Safety Initiative.'' 
   The conference report provides adequate funding in our view for the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which has the responsibility of conducting inspections and monitoring the safety of our Nation's food supply to ensure that the food that is consumed by Americans and produced and processed here is fit for human consumption, and free from contamination. 
   This is a big challenge. It is a big worry all over the country because there have been instances where there have been problems in this area. We think this conference report responds to those concerns and that will have a very positive influence in helping to solve problems in this area of food safety. 
   Let me also point out the emphasis in this conference report on agricultural research and education programs. We have to maintain a high level of technological sophistication in order to continue to produce an adequate amount of food and fiber for our country at reasonable prices, and to do so in a way that permits a level of profit for those engaged in farming operations to stay in business. It is very difficult in many areas of the country now for farmers and ranchers to make ends meet. They are confronted with a wide range of difficulties. 
   We have to invest in research to try to find new ways of improving yields for the crops that are produced in our country, and to do so in a way that is not threatening to the environment or to the citizens of our country. We have a heightened awareness of problems that can occur in this area. 
   There is almost a near hysteria in Europe over this issue. We are confronting difficulties in trade because we are having problems getting licenses for commodities and foods that are produced in the United States because they have genetically modified organisms--GMOs--which is a big issue in the U.K. particularly. The tabloids have been fanning the flames of the hysteria that has taken hold there. The European Union has been very hesitant and difficult to deal with in approving licenses from exporters who would like to sell what they are producing in the European market. In my view, many of these practices are unfair and not based on sound science. 
   But we need to have a regiment of research and development that is beyond question in terms of its impact on human health and our environment. That is why it is as important this year, more important than ever before, to have a robust research and education program that is supported by the Department of Agriculture. In colleges and universities and in Agricultural Research Service laboratories all around the country, there are funds that will be made available to help achieve the goals in this area. 
   This conference agreement provides increased appropriations for agriculture research and education programs. Total appropriations of nearly $2 billion are provided for the Agriculture Research Service and the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, $126 million more than the fiscal year 2000 level and $62 million more than the Senate-passed bill level. In addition, as requested by the President and provided in the Senate bill, $120 million in fiscal year 2000 funding will be available in fiscal year 2001 to fund the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems. 
   Approximately $34 billion, close to 46 percent of the total new budget authority provided by this conference report, is for domestic food programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These include food stamps; commodity assistance; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); the school lunch and breakfast programs; and the school breakfast pilot program, which is funded at $6 million. Included in this amount is the Senate-  passed bill level of $4.052 billion for the WIC program, including $20 million for the WIC farmers' market nutrition program. 
   The WIC program is a very important nutrition program and health program for women, infants, and children. Everybody is aware of the importance of school lunch and breakfast programs to help equip our children with the nutrition they need as they are at school so they can learn and do a good job at school. 
   We also have a Food Stamp Program that is funded in this bill. In my view, these are funded at adequate levels to meet the demands 
   and needs we have in our country. We have been very fortunate in this time of economic expansion and growth for jobs to be created so those who want to work can find work. We have people coming into the country now under special visa requirements because we have an inadequate labor supply, or at least an inadequately trained supply of labor to do many of the jobs that have to be done in this country. Many entry level positions are now being filled by those who are newly coming into the country, many just for the purpose of working on farms because people who live here and who have been here for a while either don't want to do the work or for some reason are unavailable to those who need help on their farms. 
   This is a challenge. The point I am making in connection with the food and nutrition programs is we have been able to reduce the costs of some of these programs, particularly the Food Stamp Program, because of the expansion in the economy and the availability of jobs. We need to make sure through our budget policies that we continue to have an environment economically for job growth and expansion. 
   For farm assistance programs, the conference report provides $1.3 billion in appropriations. Included in this amount is the full increase of $89 million above the fiscal year 2000 level requested by the Administration for Farm Service Agency salaries and expenses, as well as appropriations which, together with available carryover balances, will fund the fiscal year 2001 farm operating and farm ownership loan levels included in the President's budget request. 
   Appropriations for conservation programs administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service total $873 million, $69 million more than the fiscal year 2000 level, and approximately $6 million more than the level recommended by the Senate. 
   Conservation programs, in my view, are some of the less well advertised programs of the Department of Agriculture. We have increased the amount of acreage available for the Wetlands Reserve Program by 100,000 acres. 
   We have also worked hard on these programs to ensure they help improve wildlife habitat on farms and on the lands that are owned by American citizens. We have incentive programs, not just mandatory programs, but programs that encourage the management of land so that conservation is enhanced, and the protection of soil and water resources is enhanced by the way landowners use and care for their lands. 
   We found that to be a very popular way of helping to encourage and obtain the best possible land management practices, rather than having a Federal Government come in with threats and other sanctions that can be imposed on landowners. It is better to do it in a way that is educational and nonthreatening and based on incentives rather than sanctions, fines, and penalties from the Federal Government. 
   We also see in this bill something that is important to every rural community: development programs, housing programs, water and sewer system programs. They are all important in rural America. Many of these communities have some of the lowest income families in America and therefore they don't have the economic base to pay the costs that would be required for utilities and other lifestyle enhancements that are available in the larger towns or the cities of our country. These programs are very important in States, such as mine and others, which have to depend upon Federal assistance to make sure they have safe drinking water, they have sewer systems, they have electric lights, they have telephone service access. These programs are funded in this bill this year. 
   For rural economic and community development programs, the conference report provides appropriations of $2.5 billion to support a total loan level of $8.8 billion. Included in this amount is $763 million for the Rural Community Advancement Program, $680 million for the rental assistance program, and a total rural 
   housing loan program level of $5.1 billion. 
   A total of $1.1 billion is provided for foreign assistance and related programs of the Department of Agriculture, including $115 million in new budget authority for the Foreign Agricultural Service and total appropriations of $973 million for the P.L. 480 Food for Peace Program, $31 million above the fiscal year 2000 level, and the same as the President's request and Senate bill levels. 
   Total new budget authority for the Food and Drug Administration is $1.1 billion, $74 million more than the fiscal year 2000 level and $24 million more than the Senate-passed bill level. The conference report also makes available an additional $149 million in Prescription Drug User Fee Act collections. The increase in new budget authority, together with the redirection of base funds, provides FDA with an additional $130 million from the fiscal year 2000 level for funding requirements identified in the President's fiscal year 2001 budget request. These include the full increases requested in the budget of $30 million for food safety, $20 million for construction of the Los Angeles laboratory, and $22.9 million for premarket review. Also included is a portion of the increased funding requested for FDA to enforce Internet drug sales, enhance inspections, improve existing adverse events reporting systems, and continue counter-bioterrorism activities. 
   In addition, the conference report appropriates, contingent on a budget request, the $23 million FDA has identified it needs for fiscal year 2001 to carry out the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000. The FDA said it needed this amount for this next fiscal year to carry out the provisions of this conference report that provides these new responsibilities, to guarantee safety and efficacy of drugs in this new era, so that is included in this report. 
   For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, $68 million is provided; and a limitation of $35.8 million is established on administrative expenses of the Farm Credit Administration. 
   As my colleagues recall, as passed by the Senate, this bill included not only the regular fiscal year 2001 appropriations bill, but a ``Division B'' providing supplemental appropriations, rescissions, and other emergency provisions relating not only to programs and activities under this Subcommittee's jurisdiction but to various other Departments and agencies of government. Provisions outside this Subcommittee's jurisdiction have been deleted by the conference committee and will be addressed, as appropriate, on other bills. 
   Funding for emergency assistance for farmers and landowners who have been affected by drought, fires, and other natural disasters that have occurred this year is now included as Title VIII of this conference report. The total assistance package has been scored by the Congressional Budget Office at $3.6 billion. 
   The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to use such sums as necessary of the Commodity Credit Corporation to compensate farmers for crop and quality losses at the same rates as have been used in previous years. However, unlike years past, there is no limit on the amount of funds available for this assistance, thus eliminating proration of producers' payments and hopefully expediting payments. 
   Other assistance provided by the bill includes $490 million for the livestock assistance program, $473 million for dairy producers, and $328 million for producers of certain specialty crops. 
   The agreement provides needed conservation funding by making $35 million in technical assistance available for the Conservation Reserve Program and the Wetlands Reserve Program, and providing an additional $110 million for the Emergency Watershed Program of the Natural Resources Conservation Service. 
   Senators worked very hard in the conference on this issue, and 
   other  issues as well. We have expanded the opportunities to sell what we produce in the international marketplace in this conference report as a result of changes in sanctions policy. There have been many initiatives introduced on this subject. I know the Senator from Indiana, Mr. LUGAR, has a wide, sweeping, and very thoughtful approach to this sanctions issue reflected in a bill he has introduced. I hope we can pass legislation in this area that sets new policies and establishes a new way of going about deciding when and where to impose sanctions that tie the hands of our exporters and have an adverse impact on our ability to sell what we produce on the international marketplace. 
   I am not saying sanctions are bad. We have to use them in certain cases. They have proven to be very effective in certain cases. Normally, this is when we have the cooperation of other countries. But when we just unilaterally impose sanctions, in many cases that ends up being more hurtful and harmful to our farmers and ranchers and businesses than to anybody else. We have to be careful how we approach this whole issue. 
   I think the conference committee exercised good judgment and an awareness of concerns throughout our country on this issue when it made the changes that are reflected here. I am hopeful with the emergency assistance provisions that are in the bill, the other programs that have been funded, the Senate will be able to enthusiastically support and approve the work that this conference committee has done. 
   This conference report carries a number of other legislative provisions adopted by the conference committee, including the Continued Dumping and Sudsidy Offset Act; the Conservation of Farmable Wetland Act; and the Hass Avocado Promotion, Research, and Information Act. 
   Mr. President, we are already well beyond the October 1 start of the new fiscal year. This conference agreement is the product of two lengthy sessions of the conference committee. The conference report was filed last Friday night, October 6, and was adopted by the House of Representatives on October 11 by a vote of 340 to 75. Senate passage of this conference report today is the final step necessary to send this fiscal year 2001 appropriations bill to the President for signature into law. 
   Senator KOHL is the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee. It has been a pleasure to work with him throughout the hearing phase of the development of our factual basis for writing this bill. In all the discussions we have had in working on challenges before the subcommittee, I could not have asked for more cooperation or careful and thoughtful assistance than Senator KOHL provided to me and to the committee as a whole. 
   The full committee, of course, had a role to play in this, all members of our subcommittee and full committee, too. I want to express my appreciation to all of them. It was a pleasure working in conference with Chairman JOE SKEEN, from New Mexico, who is serving in his last year as chairman of the subcommittee. This is his sixth year in that capacity. The House has term limits on subcommittee chairmen. It effectively prohibits his service beyond this year as chairman of the subcommittee. But he has really been a hard-working leader in the House on the development of this legislation and this appropriations bill. We will miss working with him as chairman. We hope to be able to continue working with him closely in the years ahead, though, as a fellow member of the Appropriations Committee in the House.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I first express my appreciation to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SPECTER, for his generous comments about my efforts in behalf of this legislation as chairman of the subcommittee. He also put in a lot of time and effort during the conference with the House and also during the development of this legislation in our subcommittee. He has been an outstanding member of the Appropriations Committee and, of course, chairs the Labor-HHS Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate and does an excellent job in that capacity. I thank him for his very generous statements. 
   I also commend, as he did, the Senator from Vermont, who is chairing the Senate this morning, for his leadership on the drug importation issue. I don't think this would have been included in this legislation--I know it would not--were it not for the leadership of Senator JEFFORDS. It was this amendment that was included in the bill when the bill was on the floor of the Senate. 
   As the occupant of the chair remembers, we had a very heated debate. It was contentious. It was a matter of a lot of controversy surrounding it. I offered an amendment to the Jeffords amendment, which was adopted as it turned out, helping protect the safety and efficacy of drugs that would be imported under the provision of the Jeffords amendment. Then in conference with the House, everybody got involved, not just the conferees but the leadership of the House and the leadership of the Senate. Everybody, it seemed, had an opinion or a viewpoint on how that language should be changed or modified or improved. 
   As it turned out, the end result is something in which the Senator from Vermont can take a great deal of pride. His influence will always be remembered on this issue. I thank him for his courtesies during the handling of the issue and his good advice and counsel all along the way. 
   Mr. President, the crop disaster provisions in this bill take a somewhat different approach to compensating producers who may have suffered significant quality losses during 2000 caused by bad weather, insects, or other natural occurrences. The bill authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to compensate producers for quantity, quality, and severe economic losses. Loss thresholds for quantity and quality losses are separated in this bill, whereas they have been combined in previous disaster bills. Different crops have different values associated with declines in quality. The report language accompanying the conference report takes care to discuss special rules that should be considered for cotton, for example. 
   The conferees were concerned that this new calculation might have some unintended consequences and provided the Secretary of Agriculture with additional flexibility in devising an appropriate loss compensation program. Because there are crops, like cotton, that rarely have quality losses that are not accompanied by quantity losses, this bifurcated approach could have unintended detrimental consequences. The Secretary could use his authority to compensate for severe economic losses and calculate losses for cotton and other similar commodities in the manner done in 1999, when quality and quantity losses were combined to determine whether a producer had met the loss thresholds. 
   The Secretary could also use the authority provided him to provide assistance for severe economic losses to provide appropriate compensation to producers that incur the necessary expense to bring their 2000 crop all the way to harvest. 
   Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Montana is on the floor.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this has been a very worthwhile discussion of an issue that has bedeviled the Congress on an annual basis for too many years. We now are considering a bill that has the effect of answering a question that doesn't have to be considered each year in the future. 
   Although the amendments that have been offered ran the gamut of Chinese transgressions and shortcomings, both real and imagined, and many are very troubling, I am supporting this bill as reported by the Finance Committee. 
   Two months ago I read an editorial in the Wall Street Journal which reflected my thoughts on the relationship between our concerns about Chinese proliferation of technology and missiles on the one hand and our trade interests on the other. The editorial appeared in the July 19, 2000 edition of the paper and I saved it to put in the RECORD during this debate because in my view it answers in a thoughtful and persuasive way why this bill should be passed by the Senate and sent directly to the President for his signature.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Mississippi River Delta possesses many common characteristics and unique problems throughout the 7-state alluvial floodplain which it encompasses. The subcommittee report includes funding for a new Delta Regional Authority, an economic development effort aimed at extending special help to an area of the country that I have long considered to be a special part of my state and this nation. 
   I am concerned that many of the real needs in the region never feel the full impact of federal assistance efforts because of the centrally-planned and bureaucratic delivery systems which accompanied some of these initiatives. Because of this history, the people of the region have become skeptical about new election year promises of federal assistance. 
   I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee for clarification of the intent and purpose of this funding. First, how is the Delta defined for purpose of extending this proposed federal assistance?

   Mr. COCHRAN. The historical Delta area is the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, which includes only small portions of Tennessee and Kentucky, the typically flat and gently-sloping land of eastern Louisiana and Arkansas, Northwest Mississippi, the boot-heel of Missouri, and the Cache River lowlands of Illinois. Is it the Committee's intent that the Delta, for purposes of the federal assistance in this appropriation measure, be defined as that land which underlies those communities, counties, parishes and part-counties, which are geographically delineated by the topography commonly recognized as the Delta alluvial floodplain?

   Mr. COCHRAN. As the distinguished chairman knows, the Delta suffers from an acute need for infrastructure development that inhibits economic growth. 
   In the Report to Congress by the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission, which was co-chaired by then-Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Commission stressed that the ten-year goal of any plan to assist the Delta should emphasize, and I quote from page 92 of this report, ``every Delta resident will have access to adequate water and sewer, fire protection, flood control, roads, streets, and bridges, to improve the quality of life and provide for economic growth and development.'' 
   Although there are many very important needs in the Mississippi River Delta region which are unique to that area, better roads, educational enhancements, protection from floods, natural resource conservation and equipment and instruction support for workforce training ought to be the primary focus of this funding. 
   There are existing and proven delivery systems for these purpose which have the benefit of local planning and priority-setting by the people who reside in the Delta. 
   Is it the intent of this committee that this founding be utilized in this way for these purposes?

   Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate the Chairman's response. Delta communities in my state have been unable to provide their local cost-share for rural water and sewer projects, road and railroad improvement projects, drainage and flood protection projects, and other developments that are fundamental to a viable, local economy because they simply cannot afford the match. Unlike more affluent areas which can take full advantage of the federal cost-sharing programs such as this, the Delta typically lags behind even further. Is it the Chairman's view that these funds could be used as a local match for other federal programs?

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is very hard to adjust to the sad reality of PAUL COVERDELL's absence from the Senate. I miss him very much. And the Senate, we have to admit, is not the same without him. 
   It was always a genuine pleasure to be in his company. I enjoyed very much going to Georgia with him during his reelection campaign. I also returned with him to learn more about the severe problems his State's agricultural producers were experiencing from the drought. We worked together on these and other issues that were important to our region on the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
   He was a very influential force in the Senate for the people of his State. And he was a thoughtful leader on national issues as well. 
   While we continue to mourn his passing, we should try to carry on with the same determination and energy he brought to the challenges he faced. His example will be a very valuable legacy. Not only has Georgia benefited from his good efforts to represent its interests, but also through his leadership as Director of the Peace Corps, and on other international issues, he has made the world a better and safer place for all mankind. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment, on its face, looks as though the Senate is being asked to vote in favor of supporting the Department of Agriculture's standards for meat inspection that include the power to shut down a plant if it is found that the product being produced contains a contaminant. In the case in Dallas, TX, the Senator cites, it was salmonella. 
   The plant operated by Supreme Beef in that area was shut down by the Department of Agriculture and, according to testimony in the case in Texas, it was shut down solely on the basis of the fact that the product being produced contained a prohibitive level of salmonella, or some salmonella. 
   What the court said was that the Department of Agriculture wasn't given that kind of power by the Congress to impose regulations of that kind, and that to shut down a plant there had to be some connection between the operation of the plant and the presence of the salmonella in the product. In other words, if the plant was totally sanitary, obeyed every rule of law or regulation of the Department of Agriculture for safe and sanitary operation, just because of the test, the Department was without the power under the law to shut down the plant. 
   This amendment--if we adopt it--as suggested by the Senator from Iowa, would impose a new legal authority that is not now present, which would give the Department of Agriculture more power than it has, more power than it has asked for, and, I suggest, more power than we ought to give on an appropriations bill, without more careful review; that is, the power to arbitrarily shut down a plant, whether it is being operated correctly and in a sanitary manner, with all due regard for the product that is being produced, the safety of that product for human consumption. 
   Because of this court case that puts in question the Department's authority that it exercised in this one case, we are being asked now to say that these standards, which are regulations in effect, ought to be codified; they ought to be put in the form of a law. 
   Now, that is a step that we, in my view, ought not to take--not on this bill, not as an amendment to an appropriations bill, not on the basis of one district's court's finding in the State of Texas, which doesn't have application and is not being honored by the Department's regulators anywhere else in the United States except in that Federal court jurisdiction. 
   The Department of Agriculture has not asked for this amendment. I am advised that the Department of Agriculture doesn't support this amendment. The Department of Agriculture has not yet decided whether to appeal this decision of the district court. It may decide to modify its regulations because of this district court decision. So we would be acting prematurely and, in response to the suggestion in this amendment, we would be exceeding even the decision being made now in the Department of Agriculture, or the Department of Justice, which has to prosecute the appeal. So the Department of Justice hasn't decided, I am told, whether to appeal this decision to the court of appeals. The Department hasn't decided that yet. Yet we are being asked to reverse, in effect, by legislation, the decision of that district court. 
   We are not an appellate court. I suggest that the Senate should not act today favorably on this amendment as if we are reviewing the legal intricacies involved in this case and are making some careful, thoughtful determination about whether or not that case ought to stand or whether it ought to be reversed. I am going to suggest to the Senate that what we ought to do is look at the implications through hearings in the Agriculture Committee or in the committee that has jurisdiction over other food safety concerns. Our Appropriations Subcommittee could conduct hearings--and that might be the appropriate thing to do--and hear from the Department of Agriculture and hear from others who have views on this subject. And then we could make a recommendation to the Senate. 
   But this is a brand new decision, as the Senator said; it was made, I think, in May. It is a recent decision. We ought to let the legal process work its way to a conclusion with the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Justice, and the packing company involved in this case. They must have had some persuasive evidence to present to the court as to why the Department of Agriculture acted arbitrarily and improperly, or without the sanction of law, to shut down this plant as they did. And here we are going to substitute our judgment collectively for the judgment of the district court judge who heard all the evidence, who saw the witnesses, including Department of Agriculture officials who described what they did and why they did it. 
   The Senate needs to know that there is a committee that is available to the Department of Agriculture that is called the Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria. The Department of Agriculture and the Secretary look to this committee normally for advice and consult on issues of this kind. No consultation, as I understand  it, has taken place with this special committee of experts who are brought together for the purpose of providing scientifically based opinions to the Secretary of Agriculture on the question of adulteration and sanitation issues of meat and poultry packing and processing plants. 
   So let's not pretend that we know as much as this advisory committee. Let's not pretend that we have a better reason for making a decision in this case than the district court did, which found just the opposite of what the Senator is asking this Senate to find. So I am suggesting that this is premature. It is inappropriate for us to legislate in this fashion on an appropriations bill, without the benefit of facts and expert opinions and views on the subject. 
   So it is my intention, without cutting off anyone's right to speak, to move to table the Senator's amendment and to ask for the yeas and nays on that vote. But I do not want to make that motion right now without notice to my friend and colleague from Iowa or any other Senator who wants to be heard. We had told all Senators they could expect a vote on an amendment on this bill at or about 10:30. I hope we can keep that commitment to the Senate.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment states that the microbiological standards imposed by the Secretary of Agriculture, in situations involving those described by the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, must be imposed pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act and be subject to notice and comment procedures under that act. 
   It additionally requires the Secretary, in instances involving contamination of meat and poultry products that are subject to inspection and plant inspection by the Secretary, to seek the advice of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods. This is a panel of scientists, with members appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture. The purpose of the panel is to provide advice and counsel on matters of this kind from experts to the Secretary of Agriculture. 
   We understand that this panel has not had an opportunity to make recommendations or observations about the standards that are the subject of these USDA regulations that were litigated in this court case because the Department of Agriculture decides when they meet, and it is my understanding that the next meeting is scheduled for the fall. There has not been a special meeting called. And the issue has not been placed on the agenda. 
   If my amendment is adopted, the Senate would suggest to the Secretary that this issue ought to be presented to this panel of expert witnesses and the advice of that panel sought in this situation. 
   The Department of Agriculture has indicated that it does not support the Harkin amendment. The Senator said that it has decided to take no position on the amendment because it involves a case that is subject to judicial proceedings at this time. 
   To remind Senators, this is a court case the Senator is asking be reversed by the Senate. The time for appeal has not yet expired. The Department has not decided whether to appeal. The Department of Justice has not made a recommendation, as I understand it, whether it thinks an appeal should be prosecuted or not. They may decide this court was right and then come to the Congress to ask for additional authority, and the Congress may very well decide to give the Department additional authority. 
   But the adoption of this amendment, without suggesting the Department needs to consult first on modifying its standards with an expert panel, that was created for the purpose of providing information, would be premature also. 
   So we hope the Senate will adopt this modification to the Harkin amendment. The vote on the motion to table was a tie vote, and therefore the motion failed. We could let the Senate vote on the amendment of the Senator from Iowa without any further amendment.  And if there is another tie vote, the amendment would fall. 
   But in order to try to resolve the issue, for the moment, my suggestion is that the Senate should adopt this amendment, putting in the extra provision of consultation with the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods, and suggest that, if this standard is given the force and effect of law, there must be some connection between the contaminated product and unsanitary conditions or the way in which the processing plant was being operated in order to justify the Department withdrawing its inspectors and therefore closing the plant. 
   We want to continue to ensure--and this ought to be clear--that our Nation's food supply is safe; that it is processed in the most sanitary conditions possible; 
   that it is inspected to ensure that the food is safe for human consumption, all of that will continue to be reflected in the adoption of this amendment. 
   What we add is that scientific advice and counsel be sought by the Department of Agriculture on this subject with respect to this standard that has been thrown out by a court. If it can be modified to ensure that we continue to see the force and effect of the standards enforced by the courts, then that is what we would like to see happen. We would like it to be done in a process that gives respect for the power of a court and the judicial process that is in place but also the prerogatives of the Congress. The Congress has not empowered the Department of Agriculture to issue a standard of the kind the court said it could not enforce. That is a point to remember, too. The adoption of the Harkin amendment would give that power legislatively, give that power to the Secretary of Agriculture without a careful review of the implications of that new power by the Congress. 
   I am hopeful that this will resolve the issue for the time being, for today. The legislative committee has a right to look at it, to have hearings, to propose changes in the authorities the Department has in situations such as this. That would be the appropriate way to resolve the issue for the long term. But for today, I am hopeful the Senate will agree to this amendment, maybe on a voice vote, and then we can adopt the amendment of the Senator on a voice vote and proceed to other issues.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am hopeful that the Senate will seriously consider the proposal the Senator from Minnesota made. Senator WELLSTONE offered an amendment to actually cut the Economic Research Service funding provided in this bill and add the money to the Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration for some investigations. He lists the investigations that ought to be undertaken,  which would be funded by this additional money. The fact is, any amount of money could be spent investigating these subjects. He lists these: investigations of anticompetitive behavior; rapid response teams; the hog contract library; examinations of the competitive structure of the poultry industry, civil rights activities, and informational staff. 
   What I am saying is that I would hate for the Senate to be put into a position of having to analyze this and trying to figure out if we have enough money for the Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration and all of the responsibilities they have. We have tried to go through the President's budget request, analyze it carefully, and then present to the Senate an allocation of limited funds, and suggest that this is appropriate for the Senate to pass. We think the Economic Research Service, to be cut as proposed by Senator WELLSTONE, would be put in a difficult position of trying to provide accurate, reliable information that is helpful to farmers who are in the business of producing crops and commodities, who make their living at this, and who depend upon the Government agency that will be cut by this amendment. We think the funds are needed. We have checked with that agency to see what the impact of this offset would be on them, and they--maybe predictably--suggest that it would work a real hardship. 
   We have had a difficult time making available funds for some of these agencies to accommodate pay increases, staffing requirements, and all of the other items of expense in the operation of the Department of Agriculture that would support important economic activities in our country. And so rather than try to figure out what to try to do with this amendment and how to resolve it, I really think the best thing to do is to move to table it and ask the Senate to support the committee's judgment. 
   I have a lot of regard for the Senator from Minnesota and his enthusiasm for these subjects. I sympathize with his concerns. He has made a good speech. He has made a persuasive appeal to the Senate. In spite of that, I really think we need to stick with the committee's judgment on this. This bill has been developed on a bipartisan basis, with the full participation of Senators on the Democratic side. We have listened to suggestions from all Senators on both sides. So my hope is that the Senate will trust the committee. That is what the committee structure is about when it comes to questions such as this. There is no way for each individual Senator to look at this amendment and figure out all the practical consequences of it, consider the offset suggested, and then make a decision. 
   Do you support the amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota or do you support the committee? That is the issue. I hope the Senate will support the committee's judgment on this issue. 
   I know now, after inquiry, that there are no other Senators who have asked to speak on this amendment. I move to table the Wellstone amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.

   That is the only respect in which my amendment would modify or change the amendment of the Senator from Iowa. In all other respects, the Senator's amendment remains as he offered it.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield again, I think my amendment speaks for itself. If it is unclear, then the legislative history and trying to determine the intent of Congress in the use of the words is relevant. If the language is clear on its face and the meaning is clear on its face, then legislative history and intent and our conversation is never considered by a court. 
   My view is that this is about as clear as we can say anything. That is, that any regulations promulgated under the authority of this act to which the Senator's amendment applies must be done with the advice of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods. That is all my amendment seeks to do. That is all that is intended by my amendment. There is no intent to speak on any other subject, to affect the decisions of the Department of Agriculture in promulgating standards, promulgating regulations. My amendment is limited strictly to seeking the advice in the process of promulgating standards of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods. 
   I don't know how I can say it, how it can be said any clearer than the language of the amendment says it. So the Senator can ask me whether I intend anything else and I can assure him I don't intend anything else, other than the clear and precise meaning of the words that are used in the amendment.

   Mr. COCHRAN. I struck the language that he suggested bothered him. He read that language to be ``that is shown to be adulterated.'' 
   He was worried about connecting proof of contaminated food with the ability of the Department of Agriculture to shut down a plant. And he thought with the addition of those words I was adding something new, a new hurdle that had to be crossed by the Department of Agriculture in implementing the standards. So I modified the amendment to remove the troublesome words, to assure him the crux of the amendment was to get the advice and the input of the experts, the scientific experts. And I modified it. And that is not enough. Now the Senator wants me to interpret the legal status of these regulations as they are affected by this district court decision in Texas. 
   This morning I tried to put that all in context. I know I am taking much too much time. I discussed the reasons for my motion to table the Harkin amendment. I have just about gotten worn out with explaining why I wanted to table the Harkin amendment, why I thought it was an amendment that ought not be put on this Agriculture appropriations bill. I have said it over and over again. The Senate voted on that, and the motion to table was not agreed to. The vote was tied, 49-49. 
   I could have let the amendment then be voted on by the Senate without any further amendment but, frankly, I thought it would be helpful to the Senate to clarify the rule problem I had with the amendment, and that was why we added the language as an amendment. I proposed at that time that amendment, the Cochran amendment to the Harkin amendment, be adopted by a voice vote and then the Harkin amendment be adopted by a voice vote. 
   Think about that. We had just had a tie vote on the whole issue. Yet we offered to let the amendment of the Senator that almost was tabled, lacking one vote to be tabled, be agreed to and go on to considering other issues. That was not good enough either. 
   We took up other business because the Senator was not prepared to proceed to consider the bill further. He wanted to do something else. We finally, now after having taken up several other amendments, get back to the Harkin amendment. 
   He complained and pointed out what was troubling him. We tried to modify it. I have done everything I can think up to satisfy the Senator and to give him the right to have his arguments on the floor of the Senate, to have this issue fully considered, and to have the Senate act on it. 
   I have gone about as far as one can go. I am hopeful the Senator will agree that the Cochran amendment can be adopted on a voice vote--if he wants to have a record vote, be my guest--and adopt the Harkin amendment on a voice vote, as amended by the Cochran amendment.  
   Otherwise, maybe I will try to renew the motion to table. Maybe Senators have heard enough now so they know what the facts are about this amendment and that it is an attempt to reverse a decision of a district court in Texas that can be appealed to the court of appeals if the Department of Agriculture wants to appeal it and if the Department of Justice wants to prosecute the appeal for them. That is up to the Department and the lawyers at the Department of Justice. I am being asked to interpret and sort through this and give a definitive answer about the effects when lawyers argued their case in Texas probably for a long and full time before a court there. They made a decision. 
   What I am saying is, I would like to satisfy the Senator, but I do not think there is any way to do it. We should just move on, and let's vote and see how the votes turn out.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the remarks of the  Senator from Minnesota and bringing this issue to the attention of the Senate, frankly. More and more in the last few years, unemployment rates have been coming down. The economy is strong. Everybody knows that. 
   And I kept asking, why aren't the participation rates in food stamps and other nutrition programs coming down? For a little while, they were going up, too. We had the number of people wanting work, finding work, going up. Incomes were going up. In my State of Mississippi, we saw income levels reaching new highs, but the food stamp participation was still going up. 
   Pretty soon, though, that began to change and the food stamp participation rates began coming down. I thought this was an indication that people did not need as much nutrition assistance from these Federal programs as they did in the past. We hadn't changed in the last few years any of the eligibility or participation in the program. We did so back in the welfare reform days, and we all remember that process. There was a big push to do away with the Food Stamp Program. Some in the Senate pushed very hard to turn the program over to the States. Others resisted it. As it came out, it was preserved as a Federal program. It would be administered by the States, as in the past. By and large, it continued to exist without too many changes. 
   The Senator is suggesting that because there continue to be dropoffs, reductions in the participation, something is wrong and we need to find out what it is. If there is something wrong, we need to be aware of it. I agree with the Senator. If the program is being administered in a way that denies those who are eligible under the law for benefits, we need to know about it. We need to try to make sure that those who need assistance and who are eligible for assistance get the assistance to which they are entitled and that there are funds here that will make those program benefits available to every eligible person in our country. That is our goal. That is my goal. That is my attitude. That is my view about this subject. 
   I support the Senator's effort to have a study, and I will work in conference to see that funds are made available to do that study. I know the Food and Nutrition Service has been working on that issue. He is suggesting, as I understand the amendment, the Economic Research Service use some of the funds available to it to conduct a study, as well. 
   I am prepared to take the matter to conference and to do as well as we can in conference with the House on this issue and the language the Senator has. I am told by my staff there are some suggested improvements--and I hope the Senator will agree they are improvements in the language of the amendment--that will strengthen the amendment in conference, and, if so, that the Senator will understand and be supportive of our efforts to see that the study achieves the goals the Senator intends. 
   One aside: When the Senator made the point about amendments adopted here that are not accepted in conference, and it makes him furious, I was reminded of a story.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COCHRAN. I see. 
   I am reminded of a story my colleague from Mississippi, with whom I served in the body for 10 years before he retired--Senator John Stennis--told about a conference; I have forgotten which committee, but it was appropriations. He was chairman of the full Committee on Appropriations at the time he retired from the Senate. 
   An amendment had been adopted in the Senate, and it was dropped in conference. The Senator who was managing the conference was explaining the provisions of the bill and what had been agreed to by the House and what had been rejected by the House. The author of an amendment got up and asked: Why wasn't my amendment accepted by the House? The manager said: We discussed it fully, and there was a lot of discussion, but it was not accepted by the House. He said: I want to know why; what did they say? The manager said: They didn't say. 
   It is an indication that sometimes the House rejects an amendment. They don't feel obliged to tell you why they rejected it. They just say: We are not going to accept it. I have seen that happen. I have seen the chairman of the full committee on the Senate Appropriations Committee have to personally go to a conference and almost beg the conferees on the part of the House to accommodate an interest in his State that he thought deserved the support of the conference. 
   It was almost a humiliating experience. I will never forget it. But it was an illustration of the fact that the other body takes their prerogatives very seriously, particularly on appropriations. I am reminded every year how difficult it is to get our way in conference in negotiations with the House. It is a tough challenge. Ultimately it gets the work out, but in the process there are Senate provisions that are dropped in conference, that are not agreed to by the House, in spite of the very best efforts that are made by the Senate to have their way in those negotiations. 
   All I can say in respect to the Senator's insistence that this amendment be kept in conference is, we will do our best.

   Mr. COCHRAN. The Harkin amendment is $70 million. The Levin-Collins amendment is $115 million; the Graham-Mack amendment to compensate for nursery stock losses does not score. 
   No. 4, an amendment on behalf of Senators LOTT, COCHRAN, and KOHL to extend the wetlands reserve program; it is estimated to cost $117 million; 
   No. 5, an amendment on behalf of Senators LEAHY and JEFFORDS, compensation for livestock losses, is estimated to cost $4 million; 
   No. 6, an amendment on behalf of Senators HARKIN and BOND, for green biotechnology evaluation, estimated to cost $600,000; 
   No. 7, an amendment on behalf of Senators ABRAHAM, SCHUMER, and LEVIN, for potatoes and apples quality losses, estimated to cost $45 million; 
   No. 8, on behalf of Senators GRAHAM and MACK on compensation for citrus canker losses, estimated to cost $40 million; 
   No. 9, on behalf of Senator COCHRAN, on emergency APHIS funding, estimated to cost $59.4 million; 
   An amendment on behalf of Senators THURMOND and HOLLINGS on grain indemnity assistance, estimated to cost $2.5 million; 
   An amendment on behalf of Senator COCHRAN on conservation assistance, no score on budget authority, $6 million in budget outlays; 
   No. 12, on behalf of Senator SESSIONS on livestock assistance, no score is available, and is estimated to have no cost; 
   No. 13, on behalf of Senator EDWARDS on community facilities, estimated to cost $50 million; 
   No. 14, on behalf of Senator DORGAN, natural disaster assistance, the amendment described, $450 million; 
   No. 15, Senators INOUYE and AKAKA, an amendment on commodity transportation assistance, estimated to cost $7.2 million. 
   That is the entire list, for the information of Senators. It has been reviewed by the managers and recommended to the Senate by the offering of the amendment as eligible for agriculture emergency assistance in the amounts identified as stated.

   Mr. COCHRAN. The total amount of all of these amendments amounts to about $900 million. The bill contained $1.116 billion in emergency-designated programs and activities as reported by the committee. So the total emergency designated items and programs included in the bill, if this package is agreed to, would amount to $2.1 billion based on preliminary scoring made available to the committee by the Congressional Budget Office.

   Mr. COCHRAN. The date of July 18 was chosen because it was on that date that the National Resources Conservation Service provided a list to the committee, at our request, of unfunded needs that were considered emergency watershed projects throughout the United States. 
   It was this list from which we chose to estimate the funding needs that ought to be included in this bill as true emergencies. The total amount of the unfunded projected needs is $157,111,000. We have suggested the $70 million figure for emergencies. Of those projected needs, spring floods accounted for $30 million, hurricanes and tornadoes for $50 million, and fires for $10 million. These are either erosions or destruction of watershed protection facilities or the requirement for obtaining floodplain easements in those areas. That is generally across the United States. It is not State specific. 
   Then there are 23 States where the amounts are specifically identified as totaling $67,111,000. These are the States: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin. They vary in each State from, for example, Alaska, which is a small number, $237,000, to a large number, California, $12 million; another large number, Illinois, $7.5 million; and Iowa, which was the subject of Senator HARKIN's request, $7.5 million, to which the managers added all the other States so it wouldn't be just relief for one State but all States that were similarly situated would be included in this amendment because they all had similar needs.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, these are figures that were provided to the committee by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. That service administers the Emergency Watershed Protection Program. These are the projected needs through fiscal year 2000. They were provided to the committee on July 18 at our request. 
   This program was out of money as of sometime last fall because of the cutbacks in funding that we have been seeing in this bill, along with others as well. To try to achieve consistency with the budget resolution targets and our allocation under section 302(b), we were not able to fund programs to the full amount of the request from the administration for projected needs. 
   These are given to us as certified emergency needs from this agency that has the responsibility of administering the program.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, during year 2000, the National Boll Weevil Eradication Program (BWEP) will have approximately 6.8 million acres under active eradication and treatments will be initiated on an additional 832,000 acres, bringing the total acreage in active eradication to 7.65 million acres. The states participating in treatments currently are: Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. 
   By 2001 another 2 million acres will begin eradication, and at the same time, eradication will be completed on about 1 million acres. Thus the total acreage in active eradication in 2001 will increase to 8.8 million acres. The peak year for the high costs to the participants of the eradication program will be in 2001. 
   Initially the BWEP operated on a 70/30 cost-share basis with the growers providing 70 percent through a pre-acre self-assessment approved by referendum and 30 percent provided through annual federal appropriations. Programs in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and portions of Alabama and Florida were completed with a 70/30 cost-share. As participating acreage rapidly expanded across the cotton belt, the federal cost-share declined from 30 percent to about 4 percent in fiscal year 2000. 
   With the problems American agriculture is still facing with low commodity prices, droughts, and flooding, the burden of this program at a cost-share rate of 96/4 is jeopardizing the participation in the Boll Weevil Eradication Program nationwide. 
   This amendment, which I am offering today to the Fiscal Year 2001 Agricultural Appropriations bill, increases the Animal, Plant and Health Inspection Service's salaries and expenses by $59,400,000. This amendment includes an emergency declaration which requires the President to request the full amount before the monies are appropriated. 
   This additional appropriation will enable APHIS to increase federal funding for is to increase the Boll Weevil Eradication Program by $59,400,000 for 2000. This amount is needed to provide a thirty percent cost-share to farmers participating in the program. With this appropriation, farmers will be able to fully participate in the eradication program without putting another financial strain on their farm income.

</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-cochran-ms-2-20000719</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the purpose of this second-degree amendment is to try to help ensure the result of the change in this law, in the authority for importing drugs into the country or selling drugs to American consumers from Canada, which I think this amendment the Senator has offered is targeted to address, will not result in any new dangers to the consuming public, and would require the Secretary to certify that that would be the case for any new regulatory regime implementing the amendment if it is adopted. 
   One problem we need to bring to the attention of the Senate in connection with this amendment is the added cost that is going to result from this, in terms of added appropriations for the Food and Drug Administration. It is estimated by that agency that $92 million would have to be appropriated to provide the funding necessary to implement and carry out the obligations of that agency in connection with supervising this amendment. 
   The distinguished Senator is chairman, as Senators know, of the legislative committee that has jurisdiction over this overall subject area in the law. I regret this is an issue being brought to the Senate as an amendment to the Agriculture Department's appropriations bill. It would be more appropriate, in my view, for the legislative committee which the Senator chairs to deal with this, to report out legislation, and in the usual way of managing changes in the law, have the Senate address it on a freestanding bill. The body is put at a disadvantage to try to understand all the nuances, the implications of the legislation, what the practical results will be. It has become very controversial. I think the Senator from North Dakota, in opening remarks as we brought this legislation up yesterday or the day before, talked about the advertising that was being run in the newspapers by the pharmaceutical industry. I think that is on this subject. It is related to this subject. 
   So there is a great deal of attention being focused on this highly controversial issue. All the States along the northern tier that border on Canada have a great interest in this. It has become a hot button political subject for debate in senatorial campaigns and, I guess, all the congressional elections and the Presidential campaign. So this is a big political item here we are called upon to understand, to sort through, and then to make sure we legislate in a fashion that serves the public interest--not somebody's private political interest, not somebody's private financial interest, but the broad public interests of the United States. That is our responsibility. 
   So what I am seeking to do with this second-degree amendment is ensure that is the result; that we are not putting in jeopardy, by changing this law, if this survives the process here in the Senate and conference with the House--we are not putting in jeopardy the well-being of American consumers and we also prepare to add to the funding requirements of the Food and Drug Administration to enable them to carry out their obligations under the law. 
   With those words of explanation as to where I see this and how I see this playing out, I am not going to prolong the debate. 
   Let me point out one other thing. Some might say this is legislation on an appropriations bill; Why don't you just raise the issue in that way? Make a point of order under rule XVI. 
   The point is the House has included language in its 
   Agriculture appropriations bill and this amendment, as it is drafted--as I am advised by the Parliamentarian--is not subject to a rule XVI point of order but, rather, it is germane and would not fall if a point of order is made. That may be tested by somebody if they want to argue with the Parliamentarian about it, but that is what my staff advises me. 
   With that information about this situation I am prepared to let others talk about it. Let me say, before I yield the floor, just as a matter of general information now that we are on the bill, Senator KOHL is the cosponsor of this second-degree amendment. I have offered the amendment with him. 
   Also, as we began consideration of the appropriations bill, he did not have an opportunity to make his opening remarks. At some point this afternoon, we will give him that opportunity or he can take that opportunity when he gains recognition from the Chair. 
   I hope this will not be a long, drawn-out debate. It is not necessary. We have heard a lot of speeches about this. We have had a lot of information sent to our offices on this issue of reimportation and selling drugs and pharmaceutical products across the borders, importing from manufacturers, the rights of pharmacists--all the other related issues. It is a serious matter. But we do not need to have a long, drawn-out filibuster of it in my view. We need to vote on it. If the votes are here to adopt this amendment, so be it. We will take it to conference and try to resolve the issue in the way we always do, give and take, trying to understand what is best for the country. 
   Also in connection with the broader picture of the bill itself, we do not have a lot of troublesome issues in this bill, in my view. I have not heard from Senators. We have asked Senators to let us know if they have amendments, to bring them to the floor and offer them, and let's dispose of them and complete action on this bill. I was heartened today by conversation, as we were getting started, from the Senator from Nevada, the assistant Democratic leader, Mr. REID, who suggested we could finish this bill today. He saw no reason why we could not. I see no reason why we could not finish it today. 
   I hope as we proceed we will keep that goal in mind. Let's finish this bill today. I hope we can have third reading at about 6 o'clock. I do not see any reason why we cannot. 
   There are some Senators who want to offer amendments. We want to hear them. We want to consider them and consider them fully and fairly, but it should not take an unnecessarily long amount of time to do that. So I encourage the Senate to act with dispatch, deliberation, but all deliberate speed. That is a Supreme Court phrase that has been used from time to time.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee may be aware, Cat Island is the last remaining private island that lies outside the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Located so close to the mainland, Cat Island has many natural and recreational resources that make it an attractive target for development. 
   For the past couple of years, the owners of this property have been extremely patient while working with the Mississippi delegation and the National Park Service to ensure that their property is included in the Gulf Islands National Seashore, while competing development offers have been on the table. H.R. 2541 has passed the House of Representatives, allowing the Park Service to acquire this tract. A companion bill, S. 2638, is now pending here in the Senate, where I hope it will move forward expeditiously and be enacted this year. 
   Because this process has taken longer than expected, it is now critical that funding for the first phase of this project be provided this year through the Land and Water Conservation Fund should the enabling legislation be enacted. There is $2,000,000 in the House-passed Interior Appropriations bill which is a good start, but it provides well below the amount needed for Phase I of this project. In fact, the first phase will require $10 million. Therefore, I request the chairman's assistance in working with me to fund the first phrase of Cat Island, providing that additional funding be made available as the Interior appropriations bill moves toward conference.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to present for the Senate's consideration the fiscal year 2001 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and related agencies appropriations bill. This bill provides fiscal year 2001 funding for the programs and activities of the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The U.S. Forest Service is funded by the Interior appropriations bill. 
   This bill, as reported, also provides fiscal year 2000 supplemental appropriations and rescissions to respond to emergency needs resulting from natural disasters and other unanticipated funding requirements. 
   The fiscal year 2001 provisions are contained in Division A of the reported bill. It provides total new budget authority for fiscal year 2001 of $75.3 billion. This is $295 million less than the fiscal year 2000 enacted level, excluding emergency appropriations, and $1.5 billion less than the President's budget request. 
   Just over eighty percent of the total recommended by this bill is for mandatory appropriations over which the Appropriations Committee has no effective control. The spending levels for these programs are governed by authorizing statutes. The mandatory programs funded by this bill include the  Commodity Credit Corporation, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, and the Food Stamp and Child Nutrition Programs. 
   About twenty percent of the total appropriations recommended by this bill is for discretionary programs and activities. Including Congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-year spending actions, this bill recommends total discretionary spending of $14.850 billion in budget authority and $14.925 billion in outlays for fiscal year 2001. These amounts are consistent with the Subcommittee's discretionary spending allocations. 
   I would like to take a few moments to summarize the bill's major funding recommendations. For the Food Safety and Inspection Service, appropriations of $678 million are recommended, $29 million more than the fiscal year 2000 level. For the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, $468 million is recommended, $25 million more than the 2000 level. 
   Appropriations for USDA headquarters operations and for other agriculture marketing and regulatory programs are approximately $84 million more than the fiscal year 2000 appropriations levels. Included in this increase is $25 million to support information technology investments in support of the Department's Service Center Modernization initiative; $42.4 million to support the Department of Agriculture's buildings and facilities and rental payment requirements; $5.9 million, as requested, for costs associated with implementing the Mandatory Livestock Reporting Act; and $6.2 million for the Agricultural Marketing Service to implement a microbiological data program. 
   For farm credit programs, the bill funds an estimated $3.1 billion total loan program level, the same as the fiscal year 2000 level, excluding additional loans funded through fiscal year 2000 
   emergency appropriations. The amount recommended includes $559.4 million for farm ownership loans and $2.4 billion for farm operating loans. 
   For salaries and expenses of the Farm Service Agency, total appropriations of $1.095 billion are recommended. This is $89 million more than the 2000 level and the same as the President's budget request. 
   The bill provides total appropriations of $1.4 billion for agriculture research, education, and extension activities. Included in this amount is an increase of $3.8 million from fiscal year 2000 for Agricultural Research Service (ARS) buildings and facilities, an increase of $41.2 million for research activities of the ARS; and a $19.2 million increase in funding for the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service. 
   For conservation programs administered by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service, total funding of $867.6 million is provided, $63 million more than the 2000 level. This includes $714 million for conservation operations, $11 million for watershed surveys and planning, $99 million for watershed and flood prevention operations, $36 million for the resource conservation and development program, and $6 million for the forestry incentives program. 
   USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service is funded at a program level of $117.7 million, $4 million more than the fiscal year 2000 level. In addition, a total program level of $996.7 million is recommended for the Public Law 480 program, the same as the fiscal year 2001 budget request and $51.4 million more than the fiscal year 2000 level. This includes $159.7 million for Title I and $837 million for Title II of the program. 
   The bill also provides a total program level of $2.5 billion for rural economic and community development programs. Included in this amount is $749 million for the Rural Community Advancement Program, $33 million for the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and $75 million to support a total $2.6 billion program level for rural electric and telecommunications loans. 
   In addition, the bill devotes additional resources to those programs which provide affordable, safe, and decent housing for low-income individuals and families living in rural America. Estimated rural housing loan authorizations funded by this bill total $4.6 billion. Included in this amount is $4.3 billion in section 502 low-income housing direct and guaranteed loans and $114 million in section 515 rental housing loans. In addition, $680 million is included for the rental assistance program. This is the same as the budget request and $40 million more than the 2000 appropriations level. 
   Appropriations totaling $35 billion for USDA's nutrition assistance programs continue to command the highest percentage of the total appropriations recommended by the bill--nearly 47 percent of the total new budget authority provided. This includes $9.5 billion for child nutrition programs, including $6 million to complete funding for the school breakfast pilot program; $4.05 billion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); $140 million for the commodity assistance program; $140 million for the elderly feeding program; and $21.2 billion for the food stamp program. 
   For those independent agencies funded by the bill, the Committee provides total appropriations of $1.2 billion, $54 million more than the 2000 level. Included in this amount is $67 million for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and $1.1 billion for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The bill also establishes a 
   limitation of $36.8 million on administrative expenses of the Farm Credit Administration. 
   Total appropriations recommended for salaries and expenses of the FDA are $33.7 million more than the 2000 appropriations level. This additional amount, along with $34 million redirected from FDA's tobacco program in light of the recent Supreme Court decision, provides a total increase of $67.7 million for fiscal year 2001. Included in this amount is the full increase requested in the budget for FDA rental payments to the General Services Administration; an additional $24 million for FDA food safety initiatives; and $25 million for premarket review activities. The additional funding for premarket review will continue to strengthen FDA's ability to perform its core statutory mission of reviewing drugs, foods, medical devices and products within statutory time frames and to ensure patients' speedy access to new products and the latest technology. 
   The bill also makes available $149 million in Prescription Drug User Fee Act collections, $4 million more than the fiscal year 2000 level. 
   The discretionary budget authority allocation for this bill is approximately $200 million more than the CBO baseline level, or a ``freeze'' at the 2000 enacted appropriations level. To provide the increases the Committee felt were necessary to maintain funding for essential farm, housing, and rural development programs, several mandatory funding restrictions are included in the bill. Modest limitations on the Environmental Quality Incentives and Conservation Farm Option programs are maintained at the fiscal year 2000 levels. Funding for the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems and the Fund for Rural America is deferred until fiscal year 2002, as proposed in the President's budget. 
   Although the total discretionary spending recommended by this bill is approximately $277 million in budget authority below the President's budget request level, as reestimated by the Congressional Budget Office, the President's proposed budget relies on additional revenues and savings to accommodate much higher levels of discretionary spending. The President's budget proposes to generate a net total of $564 million in collections from new user fee proposals, and to redirect funds from ongoing projects and Congressional initiatives to pay for Presidential initiatives. 
   This Committee does not have the luxury of relying on revenues and savings from legislative proposals that have not been acted on by the Congress and signed into law. Consequently, within the discretionary spending limitations established for this bill, we have not been able to afford many of the discretionary spending increases and new initiatives proposed by the Administration, and still remain consistent with the Budget Act. 
   Food safety continues to be a high priority of this Committee. This bill, as recommended to the Senate, provides the funds necessary to ensure that American consumers continue to have the safest food supply in the world. Not only does this bill provide increased funds required for meat and  poultry inspection activities of the Food Safety and Inspection Service, it provides total funding of $377 million, a $53 million increase from the 2000 level, for USDA and FDA programs and activities included in the President's Food Safety Initiative. 
   Turning to ``Division B'', the reported bill recommended a net total of $2.2 billion for emergency and regular supplemental appropriations and rescissions for the fiscal year 2000. 
   A number of these provisions have been enacted into law as part of the conference report on the fiscal year 2001 Military Construction Appropriations Act. The substitute amendment deletes those provisions and makes other accompanying technical and conforming changes to Division B of the reported bill. 
   The Chairmen of the various Appropriations Subcommittees may speak to those provisions in Division B of the reported bill under their respective jurisdictions. 
   However, for programs and activities within the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Subcommittee, Division B, as modified, recommends $1.1 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2000. 
   Supplemental appropriations for emergency housing and relief to farmers as a result of the North Carolina hurricane and other natural disasters; for the Farm Service Agency to meet high workload demands; and to offset the assessment on peanut producers for program losses have now been enacted into law. 
   The remaining emergency supplemental appropriations recommended in the bill reported to the Senate still must be addressed. 
   These include the $13 million requested by the President to cover a shortfall in available funding for crop insurance premium discounts; $35 million to support ongoing acreage enrollments in the Conservation Reserve and Wetlands Reserve programs; and an additional $130 million for the Rural Community Advancement Program. 
   Just as devastating to producers as losses from hurricanes, drought and other natural disasters are losses from new and emergent diseases and pest infestations. The bill provides authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to compensate growers for losses as a result of the plum pox virus which has devastated the stone fruit industry; citrus canker; Mexican fruit fly; grasshoppers and Mormon crickets; and Pierce's disease, a new problem plaguing the grape industry. 
   In addition, emergency assistance totaling an estimated $443 million is recommended for dairy producers and $450 million for livestock producers. 
   Mr. President, this appropriations bill was reported by the Committee on May 10th. It was one of the first of the thirteen fiscal year 2001 appropriations bills to be reported to the Senate by the Appropriations Committee. 
   Although the companion bill was reported from the House Appropriations Committee around that same time, on May 16th, the House did not begin consideration of the bill until June 29. 
   The House resumed consideration of the bill immediately following the July recess and passed the bill on July 11 by a vote of 339-82. 
   There are approximately 26 legislative days remaining before the October 1 start of the fiscal year. It is my hope we can expedite the Senate's consideration of this bill so we can go to conference with the House and get this bill to the President as quickly as possible. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. KOHL, as well as other members of the subcommittee, for their support and cooperation in putting this bill together. It is never easy to determine funding priorities, or to balance the many competing and legitimate needs that confront agriculture in this bill and stay within the subcommittee's required spending limitations. I believe this bill represents a responsible funding recommendation. I ask the Senators to give it their favorable consideration. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Durbin amendment is unnecessary. It purports to direct the manner and details of a missile testing program that the Secretary of Defense is committed to conduct already. 
   This amendment is an unprecedented effort by the Senate to micromanage a weapons system testing program. In no other program has the Senate tried to legislate in this way to dictate to DOD how a classified national security testing program should be conducted. 
   The directions to DOD in this amendment are vague. They would inevitably lead to confusion and unnecessary delays in the development of this complex, but very important, capability to defend our Nation against a serious threat. I urge the Senate to reject this amendment. 
   I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I believe the proposed amendment on testing of our National Missile defense system is overly broad, unnecessary, and counterproductive. 
   The amendment asks that we direct the Defense Department to conduct testing of our National Missile Defense system against--and I quote--``any countermeasures (including decoys) that ..... are likely, or at least realistically possible, to be used against the system.'' And it defines a countermeasure as ``any deliberate action taken by a country with long-range ballistic missiles to defeat or otherwise counter a United States National Missile Defense system.'' With language as broad as this, there is virtually no bound to what we would be directing the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, as a matter of law, to go off and test against. I don't believe it is useful to legislate such broad and open-ended requirements. 
   Nor is it necessary. There is already a process in place to ensure that the National Missile Defense system--like every other weapon system we have--is properly tested against the likely threats if faces, including potential countermeasures. Our acquisition system has a methodical process by which requirements for any new weapon system are studied and approved, and National Missile Defense is no different. Moreover, there is an independent operational test and evaluation organization in the Defense Department as a second layer of oversight to make sure new systems are adequately tested. With those processes in place, there is no need for a third layer of requirements, levied in an overly broad statute, to deal with some vague technical notions that someone somewhere has imagined. 
   There are possible countermeasures to every weapon and those are considered as a matter of course in the design and testing of every system. We don't have legislation directing realistic operational testing against any possible countermeasures for the F-22, for example, and I see no reason to single out this particular weapon system for such treatment. 
   Most of the recent talk about countermeasures to the NMD system has been generated by wild accusations from some college professors who have long opposed missile defenses of any sort. They would have us believe that countermeasures can become reality for even 
   technologically unsophisticated nations simply because they can be imagined. But in the real world, in which ideas have to be translated to design, and design to hardware, and the hardware tested, the reality is far different. 
   Those who are building our missile defense system understand this and that is why they have built in to that system the capability to deal with countermeasures as they evolve. The pending amendment would direct a reconvening of the Welsh Commission to examine this issue, but the fact is that General Welsh and his team have already looked at this issue. This is what he told the Senate just a couple weeks ago:  
   There is very significant potential designed into the C-1 [initial NMD] system to grow to beyond the capability to deal with those countermeasures. The problem with estimates as to what people can give was that--the Chinese will share it, the Russians will share it--it's one thing to share technology, it's something else to incorporate it into your system. And, so unless they share an all-out system ready to launch, there is still a very significant technical challenge to integrating somebody else's countermeasure technology into your offensive weapons system.  
   Those who believe it will be easy for rogue states to incorporate countermeasures into their long-range ballistic missiles should consider what happened last Friday night in the test of the National Missile Defense system. A Minuteman target missile was launched from Vandenberg Air force Base carrying a dummy warhead and a balloon decoy. No nation except perhaps Russia has more experience than the United States with technically sophisticated countermeasures, and those who say such measures will be easy for rogue states to deploy derided this balloon decoy as laughably simple. Well, the decoy didn't deploy properly. As Undersecretary of Defense Jacques Gansler noted following the test, ``Others have said how easy it is to put up decoys, by the way. This is the proof that one decoy we were trying to put up didn't go up.'' 
   Mr. President, countermeasures will eventually challenge the National Missile Defense system, just as they have challenged every other weapons system that has ever been deployed. But they aren't anywhere near as easy to perfect as opponents of missile defense would have us believe, and we already have adequate measures in place to ensure the National Missile Defense system is adequately designed and tested to account for potential countermeasures. This legislation is vague, overly broad, and unnecessary. I urge Senators to vote against it.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I offer this amendment to H.R. 4577, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill to implement pilot programs for antimicrobial resistance monitoring and prevention. 
   Antimicrobial resistance has become a worldwide problem. Emerging, drug-resistant infections threaten the health and stability of countries across the world. Diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis have become resistant to treatment in many countries, and we are beginning to see these drug-resistant infections reemerging in the United States.  
   Here in the U.S., resistance is developing in both large, urban areas and rural communities. We are seeing widespread resistance develop to common drugs such as Penicillin. Some microbes are even becoming resistant to our last line of therapy, Vancomycin. We are approaching the point where such common ailments as a sore throat or an ear infection could become life threatening. The problem is not limited to a certain line of microbes. We are seeing the development of resistance in all major groups of microorganisms--viruses, fungi, parasites, and bacteria. 
   We must address this problem on several levels. We must build our public health infrastructure for both surveillance of and response to resistance and outbreaks. We need to educate practitioners and patients in the responsible use of antimicrobials, and we need to continue to invest in research on the mechanisms of resistance and the development of new treatment. 
   This amendment begins to address the global threat posed by antimicrobial resistant infections. We must aggressively act over the course of the next several years to avert the situation of a half century ago when infectious diseases were the greatest threat to human health. 
   Specifically, this amendment provides $25 million to be available through such centers as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the establishment of partnerships between the Federal Government and academic institutions and State and local public health departments to carry out pilot programs for antimicrobial resistance detection, surveillance, education, and prevention, and to conduct research on resistance mechanisms and new or more effective antimicrobial compounds. 
   For the information of the Senate, authorizing legislation is being introduced and referred to the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. The purpose of the new legislation, which is being sponsored here in the Senate by the Senator from Tennessee, Dr. FRIST, and the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, will provide a framework of legislative authorization for activities and appropriations of dollars such as that reflected by this appropriations bill amendment. I also am pleased to have the cosponsorship on this specific amendment of Senator KENNEDY and Senator FRIST, as well. 
   I am hopeful the majority leader will be able to permit us to announce that a vote will occur on this amendment as the next order of business for the Senate. It will not likely occur today but probably tomorrow at sometime to be announced by the leader. I hope we will be able to make that announcement for the information of all Senators very soon. 
   The funding that is provided as an addition to that included in the bill for microbial research into resistance to diseases, viruses, and illnesses is a matter that is emerging as one of the most serious challenges we face in medical science today. I am hopeful the Senate will approve this amendment and increase the funding for this important area of inquiry. 
   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning business to discuss two related pieces of legislation for the Department of Education that I will introduce today.

   There is a consent request that I am told was being circulated on both sides of the aisle to have a vote on the pending amendment that I have offered at a time certain. In fact, it would occur at 9:40 a.m. tomorrow and would provide for some remarks to be made before the vote. I would like to know whether or not we can expect to get consent to that proposed agreement before permitting the amendment to be set aside and proceeding to another amendment and possibly never getting back to the pending amendment. That is the purpose for my concern.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, today I am introducing a bill to establish the Reading Research Dissemination and Implementation Plan, an initiative which follows up on the important work of the National Reading Panel. 
   Three years ago I discovered that the National Institute of Child Health and Human Services had completed a thorough study of factors and conditions that affect the learning of reading in children. Since reading is such a basic and necessary first step in the process of education, nothing is more important to a child's educational development than learning to read. 
   I was honored to chair the recent hearing of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, which accepted the National Writing Panel's report titled, ``An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction.'' The report has been distributed to Congress, universities, schools, education administrators, and libraries. At the hearing, Dr. Donald Langenberg, Chairman of the panel, stated, ``There is a recent report entitled Teaching Reading Is Rocket Science. ..... that is a gross understatement.'' 
   It is time to ensure that the panel's findings are disseminated in a manner that will result in the implementation of the best practices for the effective teaching of reading. 
   This bill directs the National Reading Panel, the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development and the Department of Education to devise a strategic plan to include the findings in teacher preparation course work, professional development for current teachers, textbooks, and other instructional materials. The legislation further instructs that the plan be submitted to the Secretary of Education by December 31, 2000, and that the Secretary immediately take actions to implement it. 
   The research report, ``Relations Between Policy and Practice: A Commentary,'' written in 1990 by D. K. Cohen and D. L. Ball states, ``It costs state legislators and bureaucrats relatively little to fashion a new instructional policy. If instructional changes are to be made, [teachers] must make them. Teachers construct their practices gradually. Teaching is ..... a way of knowing, of seeing, and of being.'' 
   Over the last several years, reading assessments have continued to show that nearly half of our nation's fourth graders do not read at grade level. Research and study on literacy over the last few decades has shown that children who have difficulty reading are more likely to suffer poor self esteem, fail to achieve in other subjects, become trouble makers in school and eventually criminals in jail. The research also shows that once a child is nine years old, remediation becomes more difficult. We need to move quickly to take advantage of what is known to predict and prevent reading difficulties, help those children who are having difficulty, and begin teaching for successful reading instruction. 
   We know that successfully mastering reading at an early age makes success in life more likely. It is my purpose and hope in introducing this legislation that the classrooms of today's preschoolers, kindergartners, and early grades will begin to benefit from the intelligence we have about how our brains connect and decode the complicated processes needed for reading. 
   This legislation will engage researchers, policy makers, teachers and parents in a focused mission. A mission to ensure that children acquire the most essential skill for future success: reading. I invite other Senators to join me in supporting this important effort.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation which would establish the Congressional Recognition for Excellence in Arts Education awards to schools. 
   The 1997 National Assessment of Educational Progress Arts Report Card was the first ever assessment of the effects of specific arts instruction and the level of fine arts skills in American students. It showed that arts instruction improved competency and literacy; and without it, very few students were able to create or perform at an advanced or adequate level. The evidence of the positive effects of arts education on overall scholastic achievement is an incentive for students, parents and schools to insist upon arts courses being a part of every school's curriculum. 
   In 1997, The College Board reported that high school students with four or more years of arts instruction scored over 100 points higher on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than students with no arts instruction. In a 1999 report titled, ``Gaining the Arts Advantage: Lessons From School Districts that Value Arts Education'' it was said that, ``the presence and quality of arts education in public schools today require an exceptional degree of involvement by influential segments of the community which value the arts in the total affairs of the school district: in governance, funding, and program delivery.'' 
   It is clear from these and other studies that students who have the opportunity to be involved in music, art, theater and dance instruction at school, truly have an advantage. As part of the effort to improve education, we need to encourage arts education in our schools. One way to do that, I think, is to recognize those schools that are offering this advantage. 
   Therefore, the legislation I am introducing would create a Congressional board and a citizens' advisory board which will establish an award for schools demonstrating excellence in arts education curriculum. The legislation also encourages the boards to establish individual student awards in the future. 
   This bill sends a clear message of support and appreciation to those teachers in our schools who dedicate their lives to the teaching of music, art, theater and dance; and to those school administrators who support comprehensive arts programs. I invite other Senators to join me in cosponsoring this bill. I look forward to its consideration and adoption by the Senate in the near future.

One of the significant studies included in the research is the product of the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as the Senator from Alabama is aware, this bill includes funding for a number of transit planning and research grants under the National Planning and Research Program. The Committee report that accompanies the bill identifies a number of individual research projects, including several university based projects, and the amount of federal funding to be provided for each. I commend the Chairman and the Subcommittee for their support for University based research into transit and related transportation matters. I would inquire of the Chairman whether he was aware of Jackson State University's transportation research capabilities and their plan to establish an institute at the University to utilize the disciplines of information technology, engineering, environmental science, public policy and business to provide technical and other assistance to transportation planners, local governments and others involved in multimodal transportation?

There is no order, as I understand it, agreed upon between the leaders for another amendment to be offered at this time. So for any Senator who has an amendment to this bill, this is a good time to come and offer the amendment. We can have a debate on it. 
   The leadership has announced--at least the Republican leader has announced he wants to complete action on this bill tonight. To do that, we are going to have to make progress with the amendments.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, when we were debating the authorization bill earlier this week, it had come to my attention that there would be an amendment offered dealing with the testing program of the National Missile Defense System and that some criticism was going to be cited in support of that amendment attributed to Mr. Ted Postol, who is a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
   That amendment has not yet been offered. We are now on the appropriations bill. I expect we will hear, during the debate on this bill, suggestions that we are either appropriating too much money for national missile defense or the program is flawed or in other ways criticism of this program on various--some imagined, some maybe real--bases, complaining about the national missile defense appropriations and theater missile defense appropriations contained in this bill. 
   I am rising today almost as a preemptive debate against these criticisms which I expect will be made by some Senators. They will use Mr. Ted Postol from MIT as the authority for their arguments. So I wish to give the Senate some background, particularly in view of the New York Times article this morning as an example of merchandising, again, of a lot of these arguments that have been made by Mr. Postol. 
   On May 11, Mr. Ted Postol, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote to a number of Clinton administration officials claiming to have discovered evidence that the National Missile Defense system now being tested will be easily defeated by simple countermeasures, that the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization's own data proved this, and that BMDO and its contractors conspired to hide this information by tampering with flight test data. Mr. Postol also claimed that BMDO had altered the National Missile Defense flight test program in order to hide the truths he claimed to have discovered. 
   Mr. Postol says he discovered the fatal weakness in the NMD system after studying BMDO data from Integrated Flight Test 1A, which was conducted in June, 1997, and was a test of a prototype kill vehicle built by the Boeing Company for the NMD interceptor missile. The test was not an attempt to destroy the target, but only to understand the seeker's performance. It was intended specifically to understand how well the infrared sensor on the kill vehicle performed, compared to expectations, when it encountered a target warhead and a number of decoys and other penetration aids. 
   Mr. Postol contends that the results of Flight Test 1A showed that the NMD kill vehicle could not distinguish between a simple balloon decoy and an actual warhead, and that the entire test program, beginning with Integrated Flight Test 2, was restructured using far simpler targets to cover up this deficiency in the capacity of the vehicle to operate properly. 
   This contention by Mr. Postol is just not true. The facts are that Flight Test 1A involved a kill vehicle built by the Boeing Company. Flight Test 2 was conducted with a kill vehicle built by Raytheon, and used exactly the same target complex as Flight Test 1A, contrary to Mr. Postol's claims. Simpler targets were used in Flight Tests 3 and 4 because these tests had different objectives. Flight Tests 1A and 2 were intended to characterize the performance of the competing seekers; Flight test 3 was the first attempt to intercept and destroy a target warhead. Just as testing of any new aircraft begins with a taxi test, then a simple takeoff and landing, the first NMD intercept testing began with a single warhead accompanied by a balloon decoy. Subsequent tests will become progressively more difficult, an approach which follows the recommendations of a panel of experts headed by retired Air Force Chief of Staff Larry Welch. In fact, the Welch panel recommended that the Defense Department attempt its first intercept without countermeasures of any kind, in order to begin the testing as simply as possible, but BMDO believed it was worth the risk to attempt a more complicated test. 
   Mr. Postol appears to be unaware that the Boeing kill vehicle is no longer being used in the flight test program. The competing kill vehicle built  by Raytheon, which has independently developed software, was selected for the NMD system and has been used in every test since Flight Test 1A. 
   Mr. Postol claims to have discovered in the data from Flight Test 1A that--and I quote--``the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) will be defeated by the simplest of balloon decoys.'' The fact is that in Flight Test 3, on October 2, 1999, exactly the opposite happened, when the EKV disregarded a balloon decoy and successfully destroyed its target. 
   This isn't the first time Mr. Postol has been notoriously wrong about our missile defense program. In 1994, when the United States was preparing to conduct the first flight test of its Theater High Altitude Area Defense--or THAAD--system, he and some of his colleagues at MIT, in an article in Arms Control Today, claimed to have demonstrated that theater missile defenses like THAAD would--and I quote--``almost certainly have significant capabilities against strategic RVs [reentry vehicles]'' and that any agreement permitting such capabilities would--I quote--``significantly erode the ability of the ABM Treaty to control strategic defenses by allowing systems that could defend areas of tens of thousands of square kilometers.'' 
   As it turns out, in spite of that suggestion by Mr. Postol and his colleagues from MIT, even the government of Russia never complained about THAAD or similar systems which Mr. Postol said would so upset the strategic balance. And when other technical experts challenged his conclusions, Mr. Postol adopted the tactics of questioning the competence and integrity of his critics. A technical team under contract to the Defense Department reviewed Mr. Postol's THAAD findings and found they contained errors. Mr. Postol's response was to write a series of letters to government officials, accusing the technical team whose findings differed from his of ``spreading false and misleading information'' that ``impugns the scholarly reputation of myself and my colleagues.'' He accused the general officer heading the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization of mismanagement and of ``providing false information to members of the Russian Duma'' in an attempt to--in his words--``influence the Russian debate through subterfuge.'' Mr. Postol demanded that the Defense Department retract its study and issue a letter acknowledging its errors. DoD did none of this because they were right all along and it was Postol and his MIT colleagues who were wrong again. 
   Two years later, in 1996, Mr. Postol's campaign against missile defenses had taken a new approach. In addition to arguing that systems like THAAD would undermine the Russian strategic deterrent, Mr. Postol argued that they would be easily defeated by countermeasures. He said in effect that U.S. TMD systems were so good that they would threaten the Russian strategic force and at the same time so bad that they could be easily defeated by even the simplest of countermeasures. Both those claims could not be true. 
   Nonetheless, Mr. Postol continued to promote this argument, and created detailed drawings illustrating how an aspiring missile power might go about deploying countermeasures to U.S. defensive systems. These ideas were elaborated in an 80 page document which Mr. Postol distributed widely and which was eventually made available on the internet, so that anyone--including those who would benefit most from measures that could defeat U.S. weapon systems--could obtain it. 
   The claims that Theater Missile Defenses would both threaten deterrence and at the same time be overwhelmed by simple countermeasures is now being made by Postol and his co-authors for National Missile Defense. He is arguing that any nation which can build a long-range ballistic missile can necessarily build in measures that will allow it to penetrate missile defenses. 
   At the same time, these scientists believe, or say they believe, that deployment of a limited NMB system--even though they believe they can scientifically prove it will not work--will cause Russia to maintain higher force levels and China to construct a strategic buildup. All of this is contained in an elaborate, glossy, 175-page document which Mr. Postol and his colleagues have distributed widely. 
   It is relatively easy to conceive of devices that are theoretically possible using scientific principles. The best science fiction employs just such an approach. But it is another thing altogether to transform those concepts from the realm of ideas into hardware. Actually engineering a complex device like a weapon system is far different from merely imagining it. For every idea that is transformed into hardware and subjected to the real world's trials, many others, thought up by smart people with Ph.D.s from the best universities, are discarded as impractical. Countermeasures are no less subject to this reality than are the weapon systems they are intended to frustrate. Imagining is one thing; designing, building and testing is quite another. 
   Countermeasures aren't free. Every countermeasures which someone attempts to put on a ballistic missile costs real money. Countermeasures also consume weight and space, which mean lowered performance or less payload. Countermeasures introduce complexity, which means more things can go wrong and engineers must spend more time trying to ensure they go right. Engineers trying to perfect countermeasures are diverted from other activities they could be working on, such as extending a missile's range or improving its reliability. In short, successful pursuit of countermeasures means sacrificing something else, and some may not choose to make that sacrifice. 
   Countermeasures are an issue that must be taken seriously by the designers of our missile defense systems. And, fortunately, they are. Whether the weapon is an artillery piece or a ballistic missile, it will have to confront efforts to counter it. In fact, missile defense is itself a countermeasure to the ballistic missile. Missile defense should not be abandoned because of the probability that someone will attempt to develop a countermeasure. The talented men and women of our National Missile Defense program--who are operating in the real world in which ideas must be translated into hardware that works--are anticipating and preparing for countermeasures. This is a point that has apparently been lost on Mr. Postol and his concerned colleagues, who would have us believe that new capabilities materialize because they can imagine them. 
   I believe we are going to see more not less criticism as we move forward to implement the provisions of Public Law 106-38 and deploy our national missile defense system. Some of the critics have impressive academic credentials. Fortunately, however, people who are impressive experts in the design and construction of our modern weapons are working hard to carry out the mandates of our government to build missile defense systems that will protect our country and all our American citizens.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to improve the process used by the United States Postal Service to establish postage rates for nonprofit and other reduced-rate mailers. 
   Under the current rate setting procedure, nonprofit postage rates have changed significantly, often rising more than corresponding commercial rates. In fact, in some cases, nonprofit mail rates have increased so much that the nonprofit rates are higher than similar commercial rates. According to the Postal Service, the unpredictable rate changes experienced by nonprofit mailers stem from difficulties the Service has had with gathering accurate cost data for small subclasses of mail. 
   By establishing a structured relationship between nonprofit and commercial postage rates, this legislation would protect all categories of nonprofit mail from unpredictable rate swings in the future. The bill would set nonprofit and classroom Periodical rates at 95 percent of the commercial counterpart rates (excluding the advertising portion), set nonprofit Standard A rates at 60 percent of the commercial Standard A rates, and set Library and Educational Matter rates at 95 percent of the rates for the special subclass of commercial Standard B mail. 
   The Postal Service recently proposed to increase postage rates for all classes of mail, and this proposal is now pending before the Postal Rate Commission. As part of its request, the Postal Service asked for nonprofit postage rates that are premised on the enactment of this, or similar, legislation to change the process for setting nonprofit mail rates. Without this legislation, nonprofit mailers will face potential double-digit rate hikes. 
   This bill achieves an appropriate balance between nonprofit and commercial postage rates, and provides nonprofit mailers with much needed rate predictability. It is a compromise solution that is supported by the United States Postal Service and several major commercial and nonprofit mailer associations, including: the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers, the National Federation of Nonprofits, the Direct Marketing Association, the Magazine Publishers of America, and the Association of Postal Commerce. 
   I invite my colleagues to support this effort to protect nonprofit mailers by improving the method for establishing nonprofit postage rates.

    Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, the Senator from New York (Mr. MOYNIHAN) and fellow Smithsonian Institution Board Regent in introducing the legislation authorizing a permanent base facility structure at Hilo, Hawaii for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Submillimeter Array. 
   The Submillimeter Array is part of the world-class web of major data-gathering facilities of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Other facilities are located in Arizona and its headquarters in Massachusetts. Together these facilities support some of the world's most advanced studies and discoveries in astronomy, astrophysics, earth and space science. 
   This legislation will authorize the planning, design, construction and outfitting of the necessary laboratory and other operational space for the array of radio telescope antennas installed atop the ancient volcano, Mauna Kea. Funding is authorized in the amount of $2,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2001 and $2,500,000 for Fiscal Year 2002. The new base station will replace a current system of rented, overcrowded space shared with astrophysical operations of other organizations and countries. 
   Mr. President, I am proud of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory 110-year history and its reputation around the world. Its work and discoveries are considered to be some of the most significant of the Twentieth Century. From the first orbiting space observatories to the newest images of our galaxy, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory has worked independently and collaborated with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to explore and explain the wonders of the universe. 
   I hope the Senate will work quickly to pass this legislation so the work of the Submillimeter Array can proceed.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, just a few days ago, the Congressional Budget Office released a paper entitled ``Budgetary and Technical Implications of the Administration's Plan for National Missile Defense.'' I bring this paper to the Senate's attention because I believe it is misleading and confusing. It has given support to critics of the program who also have contributed to the confusion. 
   Some reporters and editors have characterized this study as a ``budget estimate'' of our National Missile Defense program which shows that the costs will be far higher than previously predicted. This is not so. 
   The paper is not a budgetary scoring of legislation that the CBO traditionally engages in. This is a paper of a kind the CBO occasionally produces in response to Congressional requests, providing it can spare analysts from their other duties. The request for this paper was recently made by members of the Senate and the CBO acknowledges that it had insufficient time to fully consider all of the questions it was asked to address. 
   The paper puts the total cost for a National Missile Defense system at $49 billion. I say ``a'' National Missile Defense system because the CBO paper did not examine the program actually in place and for which we have received estimates in the past, but rather one that its analysts thought should be in place. Mr. Ken Bacon, the Defense Department spokesman, characterized the estimate as an ``apples to gold apples'' comparison. 
   The Defense Department has stated previously that acquisition and operation of a single site NMD system with 100 interceptors would cost $25.6 billion through 2015. The CBO estimate of $49 billion is for a dual site NMD system with 250 interceptors. Some news reports, such as one published in the Wall Street Journal on April 25th have erroneously reported a figure of $60 billion for this year, which they arrive at by adding the cost of Space-Based Infrared Satellites. However, even the CBO paper correctly notes that those satellites will serve other missile defense programs, as well as other entirely different mission areas, and are not part of the cost of the NMD system. 
   Mr. President, I am convinced that a single interceptor site by itself will be insufficient to adequately protect the United States from missile attack, and additional capability will be needed. Whether that should be a second ground-based site, as the CBO paper assumes, one based at sea, or some other approach remains to be determined. But we should not confuse the CBO's ``golden apple'' estimate with the estimates we have received previously, which address a different, single site NMD system. 
   Even where the CBO paper tried to make a direct comparison, it still based its estimate on the program it thought should exist rather than the one that does. For example, the paper determined that the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization should buy 75 percent more interceptor missiles than it plans to for testing and spares in the so-called ``Capability 1'' single site system. It made different assumptions about construction costs, using the 30 year old Safeguard system in North Dakota as its model. And it based its costs on 30 operational flight tests over the first five years of system operation, three times the number actually planned. 
   Projecting costs for a complex weapon system still under development is an uncertain enterprise, and different analysts can reasonably reach different conclusions about what assumptions are warranted. It would have been reasonable for CBO to present its conclusions to those who are actually building the NMD system and seek their views on whether the different assumptions were warranted. This, after all, is the procedure followed by the General Accounting Office when it produces such a study. It sends out a draft for comment by the relevant agencies and either incorporates the comments of those agencies or explains why it does not agree. Unfortunately, we have been told by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization that, despite repeated offers to assess the CBO findings, CBO declined to present its conclusions before publishing this paper. That is unfortunate; had it done so, there might be less confusion about what this paper says. 
   I believe it is also important to note some costs that CBO did not consider in this study. 
   The study doesn't examine the potential costs to the United States of not having a missile defense system. We should keep in mind that the NMD program is not like a new tactical fighter or guided missile destroyer or armored vehicle, replacing an earlier generation. We have no defense against long-range ballistic missiles launched against our territory. That means that should the day come when some nation--for whatever reason--launches a missile at the United States, without a National Missile Defense system we will have no choice but to watch that missile strike its target. If that missile is equipped with a weapon of mass destruction, the results would be the most catastrophic event ever to take place in the United States. An assessment of these costs is nowhere to be found in the CBO report. 
   Nor is the cost to U.S. leadership of our continued vulnerability to missile attack. A missile doesn't have to be used to be useful in deterring actions by other nations, and we need only look at our own experience to confirm that. The United States has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on ballistic missiles over the last 40 years, none of which have ever been used. We did so because we believed those weapons would deter other nations from taking certain actions that would harm our interests. 
   The United States can be deterred, too, by the threat of missile attack. Our former colleague, Secretary of Defense Cohen, provided an example of how that can happen when he spoke to our Allies in Munich in February. He said,  
   If Saddam Hussein had five or ten or twenty ICBMs with nuclear warheads, and he said that, if you try to expel me from Kuwait, I'll put one in Berlin, one in Munich, one in New York, one in Washington, one in Los Angeles, etc., one in Rome--let's spread the wealth, one in England, London--how many would have been quite so eager to support the deployment of some five hundred thousand convention troops to expel him from Kuwait? We would have had a different calculation, asking, ``What kind of a risk are we running?...... 
   We never want to be in the position of being blackmailed by anyone who will prevent us from carrying out our Article 5 obligations or responding to any threat to our national security interests.''  
   Ther are significant costs to the ability of the United States to act in its national interests if it is vulnerable to missile attack. This report from the CBO doesn't place a dollar value on that.  
   Mr. President, while our debates on various defense programs can be served by additional views, I think this new paper from the Congressional Budget Office has done more to create confusion than to contribute usefully to the debate. I urge Senators to keep its limitations in mind as they consider it.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on April 13, 2000, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education received the report of the National Reading Panel. The subcommittee also heard testimony from Dr. Duane Alexander, Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Dr. Kent McGuire, Assistant Secretary of Education, Office of Educational Research and Improvement; and Dr. Donald N. Langenberg, Chairman of the National Reading Panel and Chancellor of the University System of Maryland. 
   The National Reading Panel was created as a result of legislation I introduced in 1997, titled the ``Successful Reading Research and Instruction Act.'' Subsequently, the report accompanying the Fiscal Year 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act called on the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Department of Education to form a panel to evaluate existing research on the teaching of reading to children, identify proven methodologies, and suggest ways for dissemination of this information to teachers, parents, universities and others. 
   I was convinced at the time that there was an absence of consensus on a national strategy for teaching children to read. Meanwhile, we had statistics which showed that 40 to 60 percent of elementary students were not reading proficiently and there seemed to be no plan to help remedy the situation. 
   The Health Research Extension Act of 1985 had mandated research on why children have difficulties learning to read. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development had conducted this research and in 1997, they had some answers. However, Congress hadn't asked for the results and the information was literally trapped in the academic and research world. 
   Since 1997, we've made some progress. Today more people know that reading research exists, but very few of us are able to decipher what it means, or how to translate it into meaningful practice. 
   Mr. President, what most parents want to know is simple, ``How can I make sure my child will learn to read?'' Until now, the response to that question was often vague, and the so-called ``expert'' or ``research based'' methods were conflicting. Consequently, there is a great deal of confusion among parents, teachers and school administrators about improving reading skills of children. Meanwhile, the Federal government has spent nearly $100 million on programs which one researcher described as, ``at best, it shouldn't hurt.'' 
   The National Reading Panel identified over 100,000 studies on a variety of topics related to reading instruction. It held regional hearings to receive testimony from teachers, parents, students, university faculty, educational policy experts and scientists who represented the population that would ultimately be the users of its findings. The panel used the information from these hearings and their preliminary research to identify five topics for intensive study: alphabetics; fluency; comprehension; teacher education and reading instruction; and computer technology and reading instruction. 
   The panel then narrowed its review to materials which met a defined set of rigorous research methodological standards. It is the development of these standards which the panel describes as ``what may be its most important action.'' By finding successful techniques that meet the same kind of scientific review that are used to test medical treatments, the panel presents its recommendations with a confidence that has never before been applied to the teaching of reading. 
   One of the National Reading Panel's objectives was to ensure that good research results were readily available. On April 13, the report was sent to every Senator and Member of Congress. Within the next few weeks, the report and supporting documentation will be delivered to state education officials, colleges and universities, and public libraries. A long-term strategic plan that will address wider dissemination and classroom implementation will be ready by next fall. It is my hope that the report of the National Reading Panel will guide us in making informed decisions on reading issues. 
   I commend the efforts of the National Reading Panel and I hope educators will implement their recommendations and use the new teaching methods and programs outlined in the report.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on several occasions I have discussed missile defense programs and the importance of moving as quickly as possible to develop and deploy missile defense systems--both theater and national--to protect forces that are deployed around the world and our citizens here at home. Of all the programs designated as ``Major Defense Acquisition Programs'' by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, only the Airborne Laser program has distinguished itself by being on schedule and on budget while meeting or exceeding all of its technical requirements. The spectacular performance of this program is the standard all defense programs should aspire to. 
   Our debates on defense programs usually focus on budgets, schedules, performance, requirements, and threats, but seldom do we pause to recognize success; more specifically, we hardly ever acknowledge the human component of success. 
   The many accomplishments of the Airborne Laser program did not just happen by accident. Rather, the program has succeeded because of the human element; because of the many people who, over the course of the last three decades, have advanced our science and engineering to the point where the United States will be able to put chemical lasers on 747 aircraft and use them to defend America, its interests, and its deployed forces. 
   Most recently, the Airborne Laser program has succeeded because of the leadership of Col. Mike Booen and Dr. Paul Shennum, both of whom will be leaving the program in April after having driven the Airborne Laser program forward for the last four years. They deserve special recognition for their efforts. 
   Colonel Booen was named Deputy Airborne Laser Program Director in the summer of 1996 and promoted to Director in November of that year. While Colonel Booen has been an energetic and tireless advocate for the Airborne Laser program and its people, his latest achievements are just the most recent in a notable career that includes early promotions, academic recognition as a distinguished graduate of the Air Force Academy, and assignments as a Defense Department Manned Space Flight Engineer and Deputy Chief of the Secretary of the Air Force's Staff Group. In recognition of his success Colonel Booen has been selected to become the next Director of the Air Force's System Program Office for the Space-Based Infrared System. It is an assignment of critical importance to our nation's security, and I look forward to continuing to work with Colonel Booen as he resuscitates that program. 
   Over a distinguished career of 40 years with Boeing, Dr. Paul Shennum has developed a reputation as a leader who leads with energy and integrity, embraces change, encourages innovation, and challenges people to contribute more than they thought they could. Dr. Shennum is one of the rare program managers who can be counted on to provide factual answers when asked a question. He does not give evasive responses, however convenient they may sometimes be for his company or the Pentagon. His straightforward approach with the Pentagon, Congress, and within his industry team has been instrumental in the Airborne Laser's outstanding program performance. I wish him the best in his well-deserved retirement. 
   The Booen-Shennum team has succeeded because both of these men understand what the word ``leadership'' means. They know it involves fixing on an objective, setting high, but realistic, standards, and leading the government and industry components of the Airborne Laser team effectively to that objective. They have refused to accept excuses for work that hasn't met their standards. They have inspired their colleagues to accomplish more than many thought possible. They appreciate effort, but expect results. 
   And it is results, unparalleled in any other defense program, that Mike Booen and Paul Shennum have given us. 
   Colonel Booen and Dr. Shennum have demonstrated how a government-industry team should act. This program is not a team in name only, thanks to the constant efforts of Colonel Booen and Dr. Shennum. They have caused the team members, including the various defense contractors, industry and government employees to really work together to achieve a common goal. 
   In their relentless pursuit of excellence, Col. Mike Booen and Dr. Paul Shennum have reminded us that America's defense programs will ultimately succeed or fail because of the people involved. I congratulate them and thank them for doing such a great job. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. LUGAR, for his work on the legislation before the Senate today. The Senators from Kansas and Nebraska deserve commendation also because of their active influence in shaping this bill. 
   I wish I could support this effort to reform crop insurance, but it has a built in bias against Southern agriculture. I supported the measure that was put before the Committee by the Chairman and I voted against the substitute amendment that was offered during the committee markup by the Senators from Kansas and Nebraska. Their amendment prevailed, and it is now the pending business before the Senate. The Chairman's mark offered farmers a choice between higher government contributions to their crop insurance premium or a new risk management payment that they could use for eligible activities which lower the financial risk of their farming operation. 
   Farmers in Mississippi preferred the Lugar bill. Mississippi has the third lowest crop insurance participation rate in the country. This bill will not increase the participation rate in my state and I don't think it will eliminate the need for Congress to provide disaster assistance in the future. 
   The bill now before the Senate, while including some of the programmatic changes that I have advocated and introduced in a bill with the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. LINCOLN, falls short of the reform that we have promised agriculture producers. 
   Here are two specific examples. First, it contains a subsidy structure which heavily favors regions of the country which already have high crop insurance participation rates and low premiums. This bill will make premiums even lower for those producers, while at the same time, effectively raising rates for producers that purchase coverage in the middle levels. The effect of this subsidy structure is that farmers who currently purchase catastrophic coverage and want to move into higher levels of coverage will only benefit from this legislation if they buy at the lowest and highest levels of coverage. Otherwise, they would be better off under current law. 
   Second, farming is not a ``one-size-fits-all'' enterprise, but some believe that crop insurance should be. This bill fails to provide benefits for those producers that find crop insurance to be uneconomical. Certainly many of the changes that are incorporated in this bill will result in lower premiums, but for some producers in Mississippi, that will not be enough. 
   I am encouraged that the Committee has provided $500 million in a pilot program that may address the needs of those who find that crop insurance is not a good business decision. However, the funds provided are significantly less than those that were included in the Lugar bill and will likely not produce a program that will be meaningful. I hope that this amount will be increased in conference so that it can provide meaningful assistance while not setting dangerous precedents for future farm bill debates. I'm hopeful this legislation can be improved in conference with the other body.  
   Mr. President, I will vote no on this bill, I will work with the Chairman and other committee members to resolve these concerns in conference.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile delivery systems continues to be one of the most significant threats to America's national security. States like North Korea and Iran are actively pursuing ambitious programs and the technology needed to threaten the United States. Unclassified reports from our intelligence agencies indicate that these efforts have intensified. 
   Iranian ballistic missile progress is largely the result of substantial assistance from North Korea, China, and especially, Russia. There is no doubt that foreign technology and assistance are essential to Iran's ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs. The U.S. intelligence community's most recent unclassified Semiannual Report to Congress on Proliferation states, ``Iran remains one of the most active countries seeking to acquire WMD [weapons of mass destruction] and ACW [advanced conventional weapons] technology from abroad.'' 
   The type of foreign assistance that is the subject of this legislation serves to increase the sophistication and rate of development of Iran's ballistic missiles. We must do more than we are doing now to impede its progress and, at the same time, prepare defenses against the use of such weapons. 
   The rapid development of the Shahab-3 demonstrates how foreign assistance accelerated Iran's ballistic missile programs. The Shahab-3 is based on the North Korean Nodong ballistic missile. But instead of simply purchasing the missile as Pakistan did, Iran chose to modify the design of the missile with Russian and Chinese assistance and produce the missile on its own. In February 1997, George Tenet, then Acting Director of the CIA, testified that with North Korean assistance, Iran could develop the Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile, ``in less than ten years.'' Less than a year later, in January 1998, Director Tenet testified, ``Iran's success in gaining technology and material from Russian companies, combined with recent indigenous Iranian advances, means that [Iran] could have a medium-range ballistic missile much sooner than I assessed last year.'' Six months later, in July 1998, Iran flight-tested the Shahab-3. An unclassified Intelligence Community report released in January of this year assessed that Iran has achieved an ``emergency operational capability'' with the Shahab-3. 
   Proliferation to Iran continues. According to the U.S. intelligence community's most recent unclassified Semiannual Report on 
   Proliferation, summarizing proliferation that occurred in the first half of 1999,  
   Russian entities during the first six months of 1999 have provided substantial missile-related technology, training, and expertise to Iran that almost certainly will continue to accelerate Iranian efforts to build new indigenous ballistic missiles. * * * * * 
   During the reporting period, firms in China provided missile-related items, raw materials, and/or assistance to several countries of proliferation concern--such as Iran. * * * * * 
   Throughout the first half of 1999, North Korea continued to export ballistic missiles-related equipment and missile components, materials and technical expertise to countries in the Middle East .....  
   This report to Congress also states, ``..... economic conditions in Russia continued to deteriorate, putting more pressure on Russian entities to circumvent export controls. Despite some  examples of restraint, Russian businesses continue to be major suppliers of WMD equipment, materials, and technology to Iran.'' 
   Because Russian government officials continue to show an unwillingness or inability to stop this dangerous assistance to Iran, the legislation we are considering should be passed to authorize and direct more effective sanctions. 
   North Korea's continuing relationship with Iran is also of great concern. Iran has already received sufficient technology from North Korea to build a copycat three-stage Taepo Dong-1 ballistic missile on its own. Moreover, senior Intelligence Community officials have testified that they expect North Korea to continue to sell ballistic missiles to Iran. Therefore, we must expect Iran to acquire the technology for the longer-range Taepo Dong-2 ballistic missile when North Korea begins its export. It is too optimistic, given the North Korea-Iran ballistic missile relationship, to expect Iran's capabilities to lag North Korea's for very long. 
   There are several significant consequences of the continued proliferation of ballistic missile technology to Iran. I'll mention two. 
   First, this assistance will allow Iran to develop more advanced ballistic missiles faster, cheaper, and easier than it otherwise would have on its own. Iran's defense minister has announced that it is working on the more advanced Shahab-4 and Shahab-5 missiles, and the Iranians even claim that they are going to launch a satellite into orbit by the second half of 2001. According to press reports, Iran's Shahab-4 and Shahab-5 ballistic missiles will use Russian engine technology, leading to an Iranian ICBM based in large part on Russian technology. Diminishing this proliferation is essential to slowing Iran's long-range ballistic missile program. 
   Second, Iran is bound to become a supplier of ballistic missile technology and expertise as its own program proceeds. CIA Director Tenet recently made this point, testifying that, ``Iran's existence as a secondary supplier of this technology to other countries is the trend that worries me the most.'' We are already seeing indications that Iran is no longer merely a recipient of ballistic missile technology. According to unclassified intelligence community reports, Iran is assisting Libya's ballistic missile programs. Press reports also indicate Iran is helping Syria and others develop or acquire ballistic missiles. 
   The legislation before the Senate will improve our efforts to restrain the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile technology to Iran. I urge its approval.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, last week the Department of Defense conducted its most recent flight test of our National Missile Defense system. A great deal has been said and written about this test in the last few days--much of it erroneous--and I think it is important that we draw the correct conclusions about what this test does and does not mean. 
   The test conducted last week was one of a series of 18 scheduled flight tests of the National Missile Defense system, and only the second to actually attempt to intercept a strategic ballistic missile by colliding with it in space. The first test this past October was primarily a test of the vehicle that actually hits the target missile. Last week's test was significantly more complicated and involved additional, newly developed elements of the National Missile Defense system, such as the ground-based radar and the Battle Management Command, Control and Communications system. In fact, a senior Defense Department official told reporters before the test that the battle management system is: ``the most difficult and sophisticated part of this entire program.'' 
   The latest test began with the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. After its rocket engine burned out, the target missile deployed both a mock warhead and a balloon decoy intended to try to fool the interceptor missile. The missile was tracked by satellites and by the National Missile Defense system's ground-based radar at Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific, and the interceptor missile was launched to meet the target. It sighted the target missile and then closed on it. 
   While the interceptor did not hit the target warhead, it appeared that all of the systems tested functioned properly until the final six seconds of these, when the infrared sensors on the interceptor vehicle did not operate correctly--as they had in the October test. 
   While the failure to hit the target is disappointing, it is hardly justification for all the negative comments I have heard about last week's test. It's important to remember that a test program involves the testing of weapon systems to see if they perform as they were designed. The purpose of this test program is to uncover problems and correct them. If it were possible to take a design straight from the drawing board to the field, we wouldn't need testing programs. We test because we expect to find problems and try to solve them. 
   What's remarkable about the National Missile Defense testing is not that the intercept vehicle missed on the second test but that it succeeded on the first one. Many newly introduced elements had to work right on this most recent test even to achieve a near miss, and the really significant news on this test is that all of the new elements which added complexity to the challenge seemed to have performed very well; the only thing that apparently didn't work properly was the one element which was already proven to work in the October flight. 
   Some of the critics of missile defense have said this test was a major setback for the program. It was not. In fact, it demonstrated significant progress in the development of a workable and reliable National Missile Defense capability. 
   The October flight was primarily a test of the intercept vehicle and its ability to identify a target in space, discriminate between the warhead and a decoy, and collide with the warhead. It did exactly what it was designed to do, but critics of the program claimed that had the decoy not attracted the intercept vehicle's attention, it never would have detected the warhead. They argued that the system can not work when there are decoys, and only did work because there was a decoy. 
   As ridiculous as that sounds, it has been echoed by those who have long opposed missile defense in any form. An editorial in the New York Times claimed that the October success was ``lucky'' and occurred ``almost by accident.'' Now wait a minute and think about this. When two objects--each about the size of a chair, launched 4300 miles apart and traveling at a combined speed of 15,000 miles an hour--collide in the vastness of space 140 miles above the Earth's surface, that's not an accident. That's a demonstration of some very capable technology and engineering. 
   Clearly, for some, no amount of evidence will be convincing. But repeating something that's wrong doesn't make it right. 
   Predictably, some are urging the National Missile Defense program be slowed down or even shelved in the wake of last week's test. For some critics, delay or cancellation is always the right course of action when it comes to missile defense. Others suggest abandoning this program for another approach using different basing modes, but that will only delay the National Missile Defense deployment we need now. Still others believe the administration's assessment of technological readiness should be delayed in order to remove the decision from presidential politics. This, too, would be a mistake. 
   We have a National Missile Defense program because we have a growing vulnerability to the threat of ballistic missile attack. That threat will not wait for us to conduct a test program with perfect results, something that has never happened with any weapon system. Delay in deploying a defense against these missiles only serves the interests of our adversaries. 
   This threat is growing. We must all remember that this program is not just an academic exercise. The Senate passed the National Missile Defense Act last spring; in September the Intelligence Community released a new National Intelligence Estimate of the ballistic missile threat which, according to its unclassified summary, judges that some rogue states may have ICBMs much sooner than previously thought, and that those missiles will be more sophisticated than previously estimated. In just the past few weeks, British authorities intercepted components bound for Libya for missiles with three times the range of Tripoli's current arsenal. According to news reports from last week, the Director of Central Intelligence cannot rule out that Iran may already be able to build a nuclear weapon. And this past weekend, North Korea said it was reconsidering its declaration to refrain from any more long-range missile tests, though of course a moratorium on flight testing, however long, does not mean that North Korea isn't making progress on its missile development programs. 
   While the threat continues to intensify, we've already had too much delay in deploying a missile defense system. In fact, we are behind today precisely because those who counsel delay have long had their way, not because of any inherent problems with the technology. What's required now is that we stay the course we set for ourselves when we passed the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. That act makes it the policy of the United States to deploy a National Missile Defense system as soon as technologically possible. With the successful test in October and last week's test incorporating additional elements of the National Missile Defense system, the talented men and women of our armed forces and industry have demonstrated that this system is technologically possible. The test program is in its early stages and much can and will be done to refine the system between now and the start of missile production. But there is no question that this technology is not just within our reach but is actually in our grasp now. 
   I congratulate the Defense Department for the extraordinary technical accomplishments it has achieved so far, and urge it to continue to work to improve this important program.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor and to support the passage of the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act, S. 335. 
   I congratulate the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. COLLINS, for her successful efforts to get this legislation adopted to curb deceptive mailings. She has provided strong leadership and sound guidance on this important issue. As Chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Senator COLLINS has worked effectively to examine the problems relating to sweepstakes and promotional mailings and develop this legislation to strengthen our laws. I applaud her work in crafting this bill and her continuing efforts to protect consumers. 
   The Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act includes new safeguards to protect consumers against misleading and dishonest sweepstakes and other promotional mailings, including government look-alike mailings. The bill grants additional investigative and enforcement authority to the United States Postal Service to stop unscrupulous mailings and establishes standards for all sweepstakes mailings by requiring certain disclosures on each mail piece. 
   This bill is an important step toward the prevention of deception in sweepstakes and other promotional mailings. I compliment Senator COLLINS on her efforts, and I am pleased to support the passage of the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act.

    Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to make technical corrections to the status of certain land held in trust for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, and to take certain land into trust for the Band. 
   Mr. President, the lands involved in this bill are lands currently owned by the tribe. Over the last 20 years, the tribe has attempted to transfer the land to reservation land, through the regular processes of the Department of Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The land transfer applications have the support of the State of Mississippi and the local neighboring governments. 
   Countless times over the years, the tribe has been told by the Department that land transfer applications have been lost and that action would occur soon. 
   Housing, a school and a medical clinic are among the construction plans that are detained because of the inaction by the Department and BIA. Mr. President, this tribe is simply out of time. The school waiting to be replaced has over two pages of safety violations from the BIA. The medical clinic will not pass its next inspection. Thousands of Mississippi Choctaw citizens have substandard living conditions because of the lack of available housing. 
   Mr. President, the Choctaws are held up as the best example of self determination. Yet, the federal government seems determined to throw obstacles in the course of their success. The history of these land acquisition applications and the treatment of the tribe is intolerable. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed the bill and advises it has no budgetary impact. I urge the Senate to pass this bill.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, a report on the National Missile Defense program has been completed and will be released shortly by a panel of experts which is chaired by retired Air Force General Larry Welch. The director of the Defense Department's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization requested this report which examines the National Missile Defense program and makes several recommendations for improvement. 
   Many will remember that General Welch and his panel issued a previous report last year which examined aspects of both the National Missile Defense program and several Theater Missile Defense programs. 
   Generally speaking, the newest Welch Report is a helpful critique of the National Missile Defense Program. Given the importance of this program, additional knowledge of its inherent risks will help BMDO to structure and run the best program possible. 
   In particular, I support the report's emphasis on giving the BMDO program manager, as well as the Lead Systems Integrator, increased authority in running this program.  
   The report's emphasis on additional ground testing and purchasing additional hardware--such as a second launcher for the Kwajalein test site--makes good sense. 
   Any program subjected to scrutiny on the level of the Welch Panel's will face some criticism about particular aspects of how the program is being conducted. But one key phrase in the report is worth keeping in mind, and I quote: ``Given the set of challenges and the phased decision process, the JPO [BMDO's NMD Joint Program Office] and LSI [Boeing, the Lead System Integrator] have formulated a sensible, phased, incremental approach to the development and deployment decision--while managing the risk.'' 
   Every DoD program has some degree of risk; the risk in each program, NMD included, can be mitigated by additional time and money. However, the NMD program is not being developed in a vacuum, a point clearly made by North Korea's flight test of the three-stage Taepo Dong I ICBM in August of 1998. We don't have the luxury of time. Because of the proliferation threat, our choice is simple: We can accept additional program risk, or we can leave the United States vulnerable to rogue threats of coercion by placing a premium on wringing risk from the NMD program. 
   The emphasis must be on protecting America and American interests. The continued vulnerability of the United States is unacceptable, which is why many of the Welch Report's recommendations should be implemented as quickly as possible. 
   Because of the threat we have no choice but to accept a high-risk program. We ought to accept as much risk as we can stand, because the consequences of not being prepared for the threat are so high. ``High'' risk is not synonymous with ``failure,'' as demonstrated by the recent successful intercept conducted by this program. Decision points in the National Missile Defense program should not be adjusted because of a high level of risk in the program, but only if the level of risk becomes unacceptably high. To date no senior Defense Department official has told me that the level of risk in the NMD program is unacceptable. 
   Much of this report focuses on a lack of hardware to test and insufficient simulation facilities. That is the reason Congress added $1 billion for missile defense last year. 
   The Welch Report also calls for flight tests against more varied targets. After the recent successful NMD flight test, there was an unfortunate rush to judgment by some who wanted to indict this program as a fraud for not attempting the most complex intercept test immediately. These critics were obviously unaware of the fact that it was the Welch Panel, during its investigation, which recommended to BMDO that the recent flight test be simplified. I support the Welch Report's suggestion for realistic testing, and hope that everyone will keep in mind the importance of testing the basics first, and then proceeding to more complex tests. 
   There are, of course, some problems with testing against more realistic targets that have nothing at all to do with the NMD program. According to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, BMDO believes it is--and I quote from a note BMDO sent to my staff--``constrained by START treaty limitations''--from testing against more realistic targets. 
   This surely must be a misunderstanding within the Defense Department that will be resolved quickly. 
   I want to commend the members of the panel who produced the Welch Report. I hope that some of their concerns have been ameliorated by the recent NMD intercept, which occurred too late to be included in their report.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, recent comments by several Russian Government officials about the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and our plans to deploy a national missile defense are very troubling to me. For example, the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr. Ivanov, was quoted last week as saying:  
   There ..... cannot be any bargaining with the Americans over the anti-ballistic missile defense.  
   This may be a clever negotiating tactic, but it is not a very productive one. It unnecessarily pushes the United States to make a choice between defending ourselves against limited ballistic missile threats and withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. We have already decided, by the adoption of the National Missile Defense Act, that we will defend ourselves as soon as technologically feasible against limited ballistic missile attack. We should not be forced to withdraw from the treaty. 
   The Russians should understand that our system is directed at rogue threats and will not jeopardize their strategic deterrent force. We have an opportunity to work cooperatively to ensure that we are protected, both Russia and the United States, against emerging ballistic missile threats without undermining strategic deterrence. 
   The ABM Treaty needs to be changed to permit the deployment of defenses against limited ballistic missile threats and to allow the parties to utilize new defensive technologies. There should be no restrictions, for example, on the use of sensor capabilities such as the space-based infrared system and cooperative engagement capability. We should also be able to take advantage of new basing modes and advanced technologies such as the airborne laser. 
   The ABM Treaty must be interpreted to allow the parties to use the best technologies that are available in their own defense against rogue threats. The strategic deterrent of each nation can be preserved at the same time limited missile defenses are permitted and considered acceptable under the ABM Treaty. 
   Another Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said last week:  
   Russia does not see as acceptable such an ``adaptation" of this treaty. Russia will not be a participant in destroying the ABM Treaty.  
   The Russian Government's contention that adapting the ABM Treaty to modern realities is akin to destroying it is unfortunate. In fact, the opposite is true. To refuse to adapt this treaty to the new realities is to guarantee its irrelevance. 
   One reality is the new ballistic missile threat. The other is that the United States is going to respond to this threat and protect itself by deploying a missile defense system. The sooner the Russians understand our commitment to defend ourselves, the more likely it is we can agree to sensible modifications of the ABM Treaty for our mutual benefit and safety.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague in advising the Senate that today our State of Mississippi, mourns with a heavy heart, the passing of Walter Payton, who died yesterday. 
   His accomplishments on the football field at Jackson State University and at Soldiers Field in Chicago as a member of the Chicago Bears are well known to all of us. He was the greatest running back in the history of football. 
   He reflected a great deal of credit on our State not only because he was a great football player but because of his personality, his generosity, and his kindness to his family and friends. I know he would often fly members of his family and friends--including a member of my staff, Barbara Rooks, who is a close friend of the Payton family--to Chicago for football games. He was devoted to his mother, Mrs. Aylene Payton and his sister Pamela and he was very close to his brother Eddie, who was a great football payer too as a well as a professional golfer. Eddie Payton also coached the Jackson State University golf team to the national championship. 
   The family is well respected in so many ways. I could go on for a long time and tell you more about his mother and what a dear lady she is and the exemplary community spirit of all the members of Walter Payton's family.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for bringing the problem of Impact Aid fund distribution to the attention of the Senate. 
   In my State, the Impact Aid payments to schools is a relatively small sum, about $300,000. So, it is especially important that those funds are distributed in an accurate and timely manner. I hope that in our consideration of reauthorizing the elementary and secondary education programs, that Impact Aid is given careful review. I will work to be of assistance in this effort. 
   Again, I thank my friend from Oklahoma for his leadership on this issue. And, I thank the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, the Senator from Vermont, for his willingness to address the issue.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I rise today on a substantive issue which has caused me considerable concern recently. It has to do with the issue of our national missile defense and the fact we passed legislation earlier this year on that subject, and we now hear the administration discussing its options under the National Missile Defense Act. We hear responses from around the world about the intent we have that is now in our law to deploy a limited national defense system. I want to speak on that subject for a minute or two. 
   When we passed the National Missile Defense Act, we all realized, and the President did, too, when he signed it, that the ABM Treaty, the antiballistic missile defense treaty, that exists between the United States and Russia, prohibits the deployment of a national missile defense system and that the treaty would have to be amended if it was to remain in force. 
   Some statements being made on the subject now by our own administration, as well as by Russian officials, cause me considerable concern. For example, the Secretary of State recently said that the administration was examining ``the possibility of adjusting [the ABM Treaty] slightly in order to have a National Missile Defense.'' 
   Since article I of the treaty expressly prohibits a national missile defense, the Secretary's suggestion that only a slight adjustment is required in the treaty language is a huge understatement, and it is likely to mislead the Russians and others as well. 
   The National Missile Defense Act acknowledges our policy of pursuing arms control arrangements, but it requires the deployment of a limited national missile defense which contradicts the initial premise of the ABM Treaty. 
   A number of Russian Government officials have said they will not negotiate changes in the ABM Treaty. A Russian foreign ministry spokesman has been quoted as saying it is ``absolutely unacceptable to make any changes in the key provisions of the treaty and the Russian side does not intend to depart from this position.''

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, yesterday the Senate reached an agreement for 6 hours of debate on the Agriculture conference report. That time will expire today at 3:30 p.m. Senators may expect a vote on the conference report to occur then unless time is yielded back. The time will be controlled 2 1/2 hours on each side, with 1 hour under the control of the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. WELLSTONE. 
   During the rest of the session today, the Senate will go back into executive session to complete consideration of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. There are approximately 3 hours remaining for debate, so a vote is expected to occur prior to adjournment today. The Senate is also expected to begin consideration of the campaign finance reform legislation or any conference reports that may be available for action by the Senate.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, under the agreement, I yield myself such time as I may consume on the Agriculture conference report. 
   As Senators will remember, we invoked cloture on this conference report yesterday. I think the vote was 79-20. So by a very decisive vote, the Senate has expressed its will that we should complete action on this conference report. So debate has been limited, by agreement, to 6 hours, as described in the announcement to the Senate. 
   I am very pleased we have reached this point. This has been a very difficult and hard to resolve conference agreement. There have been a lot of issues extraneous to the appropriations process this year that had to be considered because they were raised either in the Senate or during consideration of the conference report. 
   We have reached the point, though, that it is time to complete action on this conference report. We are appropriating funds for the fiscal year that began on October 1. So we have already begun the fiscal year during which the funds we will approve today will be needed. These funds are going to be allocated for administration by the Department of Agriculture among a wide range of programs. Sixty billion dollars are made available under the terms of this bill for programs of the Department of Agriculture including agricultural research, food and nutrition service, conservation programs, agricultural support programs, and rural development. We also have the responsibility of funding the Food and Drug Administration and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission activities under this bill. So funds are provided for those agencies as well. 
   I am very pleased that the conference agreement reflects a very strong commitment to the food safety initiatives. The President has been very active in his effort to increase funding for a number of those programs. Funds are provided for that--not all that the President wanted for every aspect of the program, but it is a well-balanced program. 
   We also fund the Food Safety Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture. Under that program, we have inspection that is conducted at food processing plants throughout the country, trying to make sure the food that is made available in the marketplace  in our country is safe and wholesome, trying to alleviate concerns and the risks of foodborne illnesses. 
   I daresay we have the best record of any country in the world in protecting our citizens from foodborne illnesses, and this is due in large part to those industries and those people who are involved every day in preparing and marketing the foods that make up the U.S. food supply. So they are the ones who really deserve the credit, in my opinion, and we very often do not recognize that. Government officials like to take the credit for just about everything, and I think that is wrong. In our society, we have a lot of people who work very hard and in a very conscientious way with the latest technologies to try to help make this country the best in the world, and they have done it. 
   We try to support the activities of food processors and producers, but we sometimes fall short. This year, for example, we have had a very serious problem in production agriculture because of low commodity prices. There is an oversupply of some commodities in the world market that has depressed prices a great deal. We have seen a lot of weather-related disasters strike production agriculture this year. So in this bill there is a response to that problem. A generous disaster assistance program totaling $8.7 billion is included in this conference report, providing emergency assistance for production agriculture. 
   The head of the Mississippi Farm Bureau was interviewed after the House approved this conference report to get his reaction to the need in agriculture for the funds that were provided in this bill. Here is what David Waide of the Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation said about this emergency assistance: 
   It ``could well mean the difference in massive foreclosures and the ability to continue farming'' in Mississippi. ``It's that serious,'' he said, ``because of the market situation and the extremely low commodity prices and the natural disaster we've had with weather, every producer is impacted to some degree.'' He went on to say, ``With the type of market losses that we're seeing as a result of an extremely dry year, the producers are still going to have to struggle.'' 
   I point this out because there are some who think we have overreacted to the problems in agriculture this year. Every farmer in every area of the country may not be seriously affected by the problems I have discussed and described but most are. In my State of Mississippi, David Waide has it right. He has described what the problems are and what the needs are, why it is important for this appropriations bill with this emergency disaster assistance program to be approved. 
   I am hopeful Senators will come to the floor under the order that we have provided for debate. We have a good amount of time available for the discussion of sanctions legislation we adopted in the Senate on an amendment offered by Senator ASHCROFT, which would have limited the unilateral power the President has to impose embargoes, in effect, or trade embargoes, stopping the flow of agricultural commodities from this country into the international marketplace as a means for trying to discipline other countries or coerce them into some kind of change of behavior. For many, this has seemed to be an area where we have unfairly targeted agriculture and made agricultural producers and exporters bear the brunt of American foreign policy and, in many cases, it hasn't worked. It hasn't worked to change the behavior of those countries against whom the trade embargoes or sanctions were imposed. And it has hurt our own economy--not just the agricultural producers and exporters but others, because it has had a ripple effect throughout our economy. So I supported that initiative and I hope we can see legislation of that kind enacted. But because it was legislation, a change in law, there were objections to it being included on this appropriations bill. 
   So there will be other opportunities to take up that issue, and I hope the Senate will address that at the earliest possible time. We have time available for Senator ASHCROFT and others who are interested in discussing that issue. Under the impression that there will be Senators coming to the floor soon to discuss those issues and others, I am prepared to yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent the time under the quorum call be charged equally to both sides under the order.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding there is no statutory test for defining or deciding what is and is not an emergency. Even for OMB, it is a matter of policy, as we understand it, and that is an executive branch agency under the jurisdiction of the President of the United States. 
   In the Senate, an emergency is whatever the Senate decides is an emergency. A majority of the Senate can designate an event or an appropriation as being for an emergency purpose, and that is how we judge whether it is an emergency--whether a majority of the Senate approves it as such.

All five of the ones you have listed are subjected to--there is no analytical test, in other words, with which one can do this. I do not think there is any substitute for good judgment and common sense myself, and I think that is what the Senate relies upon.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I think his point is illustrated by the fact we have seen legislation introduced to reform and improve the Crop Insurance Program to get at that kind of problem. If farmers find crop insurance both affordable and effective to compensate them for losses of this kind, they would buy crop insurance. We have a flawed program now. We are trying to get the legislative committee to act on legislation on that subject. 
   Senator LINCOLN from Arkansas and I have cosponsored a bill that we think is needed in order to make that kind of program effective and more attractive in the South. We think the current program does not represent a reasonable or thoughtful investment of a farmer's funds--at least that is the attitude of most southern farmers with whom we have talked on this subject. 
   One other point on this and that is, there is a Federal Emergency Management Agency appropriation that is made every year. That is a subject in the budget resolution, and we have in the VA-HUD appropriations bill funds to appropriate to that agency to respond to the needs of people confronted with disaster. It is not that the budget is silent on the subject of disasters. There is the Crop Insurance Program that is subsidized by the Government, and there is the FEMA program that is funded in the budget each year.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I will yield back time if no other Senator seeks recognition because I don't need to talk anymore. 
   I have talked enough about the bill, trying to explain that we have attempted to identify not only the emergency needs that exist by reason of the collapse of prices for commodities for agricultural producers but also the disaster assistance that is needed now to compensate those who have suffered drought-related and other weather-related disasters on the farm. 
   We have in the conference report a statement by managers indicating that we realize it may be difficult or impossible to ascertain the exact dollar amount of losses attributable to disaster during this crop year. For that reason, we call upon the Department of Agriculture, the Secretary, to monitor the situation and submit to the Congress, if it is justified, a supplemental budget request for any additional funds. 
   We are confident the Senate and the House, as well, will carefully consider any supplemental request for such funds. We think this is a generous response to the needs in agriculture, but we know it is not enough to satisfy every single need of every individual in agriculture. I don't know that anybody could design a program that would do that. I don't recall there ever being a more generous disaster assistance program approved by this Congress than this one--$8.7 billion in emergency assistance. We hope that will be helpful. That is only a part of this legislation, however. 
   There is $60 billion of funding for all the fiscal year 2000 programs that will be administered by the Department of Agriculture and also funds for the operation of the Food and Drug Administration and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This bill is within its allocation under the Budget Act. It is consistent with the budget resolution adopted by this Congress. We are hopeful the Senate will express its support by voting overwhelmingly for the conference report. 
   I am aware of no other Senator who has requested time to speak on the bill. I know we have 5 minutes remaining on the bill. To await the arrival of any Senator who does want to speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to present to the Senate the conference report on H.R. 1906, the Fiscal Year 2000 Agriculture Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. 
   The conference agreement provides total new budget authority of $60.3 billion for programs and activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture with the exception of the Forest Service, which is funded by the Interior appropriations bill. 
   The Food and Drug Administration and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are included also, and expenses and payments of the farm credit system are provided. 
   The bill reflects approximately $5.9 billion more in spending than the fiscal year 1999 enacted level and $6.6 billion less than the level requested by the President. 
   It is $418 million less than the House-passed bill level and $391 million less than the Senate-passed bill level. 
   I must point out that we, of course, are constrained with the adoption of this conference report by allocations under the Budget Act. The bill is consistent with the allocations that have been made to this subcommittee under the Budget Act, and it is consistent in other respects with the Budget Act. 
   The increase above the fiscal year 1999 enacted level reflects the additional $5.9 billion which the administration projects will be required to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for net realized losses. 
   The conference report also provides an additional $8.7 billion in emergency appropriations to assist agricultural  producers who experienced weather-related agricultural and 
   market losses during 1999. 
   This was a difficult conference. We met on two occasions. House conferees at one point asked for a recess in our deliberations to discuss some of the difficult issues that were confronting the conferees. As a matter of fact, after the request for the recess for a conference among House conferees, we never were able to get back into a formal meeting with the House conferees. It was an unusual procedure because of that. 
   Negotiations took place Member to Member, Senator to conferee among a lot of interested Members of the House and Senate on a wide range of issues. Some of the most contentiously involved issues weren't in the bill, one of which was the dairy proposal for reauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact, and an authorization for additional regional compacts. 
   There was a discussion of the Senate-passed provision relating to sanctions and trying to change the policy by changing the statute with respect to the authority of the President to impose unilateral sanctions against the export of U.S. agricultural commodities. 
   These involve situations where we are trying to influence the conduct of other nations using interruption in trade from the United States to put pressure on these other countries. Senator ASHCROFT of Missouri had led the effort in the Senate to put language in the Senate bill on that subject. 
   The House conferees insisted on a provision that would have imposed special restrictions on trade with Cuba. This ended up being a very difficult issue to resolve, and finally was left out of the conference report at the insistence of the House. 
   We tried to work out other disagreements. 
   We think that it is a balanced bill, and it addresses a wide range of needs for funding for this next fiscal year--agricultural research, food and nutrition programs, agricultural support programs, conservation programs--trying to insist that we do an effective job to protect the environment as it relates to agricultural production and the needs of production agriculture. 
   I hope the Senate will look with favor on the bill. The House adopted the conference report on October 1, I believe, by a substantial margin. We hope the Senate will look with favor and act accordingly. 
   Including Congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-year spending actions, this conference agreement provides total non-emergency discretionary spending for fiscal year 2000 of just under $14 billion in budget authority and $14.3 billion in outlays. These amounts are consistent with the revised discretionary spending allocations established for this conference agreement. 
   It was a difficult conference. After two meetings, the House conferees requested a recess. Because of some intractable issues, the House proposed to bring the conference to a close without reconvening the conference committee. This was not a procedure I preferred, but one that was necessary to reach a conference agreement on this appropriations measure so that it could be approved by the Congress and sent to the President as close as possible to the start of the new fiscal year. I wish to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator KOHL, and the chairman of the House subcommittee, Congressman SKEEN for their hard work on this bill and their cooperation in achieving this conference product. 
   I am pleased to report that this conference report provides increased funding of $51.9 million for activities and programs in this bill which are part of the administration's ``Food Safety Initiative.'' In addition, the conference report provides $649 million for the Food Safety and Inspection Service, an agency critical to maintaining the safety of our food supply, $32 million more than the fiscal year 1999 level. 
   This conference agreement also provides increased appropriations for agriculture research programs. An appropriation of $834 million is provided for the Agriculture Research Service, $49 million more than the fiscal year 1999 level and $25 million more than the Senate-passed bill level. Total funding of $950 million is provided for research, education, and extension activities of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, $31 million more than the fiscal year 1999 level and $19 million more than the Senate-passed bill level. 
   Approximately $35 billion, close to 58 percent of the total new budget authority provided by this conference report, is for domestic food programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These include food stamps; commodity assistance; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); the school lunch and breakfast programs; and the new school breakfast pilot program funded at $7 million. The conference adopted an appropriations level of $4,032 billion for the WIC program, $6 million less than the Senate bill level and $27 million more than the level recommended by the House. More recent data on actual participation rates and food package costs indicates that this appropriation will be sufficient to maintain a 7.4 million average monthly WIC participation level in fiscal year 2000. 
   For farm assistance programs, the conference report provides $1.2 billion in appropriations. Included in this amount is the full increase of $80 million above the fiscal year 1999 level requested by the administration for Farm Service Agency salaries and expenses, as well as appropriations to meet or exceed the fiscal year 2000 farm operating and farm ownership loan levels included in the President's budget request. 
   Appropriations for conservation programs administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service total $813 million, $13 million more than the House bill level and $5 million more than level recommended by the Senate. 
   For rural economic and community development programs, the conference report provides appropriations of $2.2 billion to support a total loan level of $7.6 billion. Included in this amount is $719 million for the Rural Community Advancement Program, $640 million for the rental assistance program, and a total rural housing loan program level of $4.6 billion. 
   A total of $1.1 billion is provided for foreign assistance and related programs of the Department of Agriculture, including $113 million in new 
   budget authority for the Foreign Agricultural Service and a total program level of $976 million for the P.L. 480 Food for Peace Program, $39 million above the budget request. 
   Total new budget authority for the Food and Drug Administration is $1.1 billion, $70 million more than the fiscal year 1999 level and $5.1 million more than the Senate-passed bill level, along with an additional $145 million in Prescription Drug Act and $14.8 million in mammography clinics user fee collections. Included in the appropriation for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration is the full $30 million increase requested in the budget for food safety, along with the Senate-recommended increase of $28 million for premarket approval activities. The additional funding provided to the FDA for premarket approvals will hopefully enable the agency to speed up device, drug, food additive, and other product review times to prevent unnecessary delays in getting new products to the market. 
   For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, $63 million is provided; and a limitation of $35.8 million is established on administrative expenses of the Farm Credit Administration. 
   Title VIII of this conference report provides emergency relief to agricultural producers and others who have suffered weather-related and economic losses. Senators may recall that during consideration of this bill in the Senate, an amendment was adopted providing over $7.6 billion in disaster assistance for agricultural producers. The conference agreement essentially retains the amendment adopted by the Senate and provides $1.2 billion for 1999 crop losses for a total of $8.7 billion. 
   Included in the emergency assistance provided is: $5.54 billion for market loss assistance; $1.2 billion for crop loss assistance; $475 million for soybean producers; $400 million for 2000 crop insurance discounts; $328 million for tobacco producers; $325 million for livestock and dairy producers; $82 million for producers of certain speciality crops; and reinstatement of the cotton step-2 program. 
   On May 14 of this year, the conferees on the Hurricane Mitch and Kosovo  supplemental appropriations bill included language in the statement of managers recognizing the likelihood that additional disaster assistance would be needed for agricultural producers this year. The conferees called on the Administration to submit requests for supplemental appropriations once it determined the extent of the needs. 
   In June, 21 Senators joined me in writing the President to bring this statement of managers language to his attention and to invite the administration to submit a request for supplemental appropriations. As of today, we have received no response to our letter nor a request for any funds for farmers. Other Members of Congress have made similar requests of the administration with the same result. 
   On September 15, 1999, the Secretary of Agriculture testified before the House Agriculture Committee that the estimated needs for crop losses was between $800 million and $1.2 billion. This bill provides the full $1.2 billion that the Secretary estimated was needed. While I understand that these estimates were issued prior to Hurricane Floyd, it is my understanding that damage estimates are still being formulated.

   Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Utah for his comments regarding funding for the Food and Drug Administration. As the Senator knows, the Congress is required to comply with fiscal year 2000 budget caps on discretionary spending. Unlike the President's budget, we do not have the luxury of being able to offset appropriations' increases with savings from questionable scoring tactics, or from new user fee and other proposed legislation which has not won the support of the appropriate authorizing committees of the Congress. 
   I understand the Senator's concern that this conference agreement does not provide the full fiscal year 2000 level requested for the FDA. However, it does provide the FDA with a substantial increase in funding from the fiscal year 1999 level to provide the amount requested for two of FDA's highest priority activities--food safety and premarket review. I can assure my colleague from Utah that we will continue to review the funding needs of this critical public health agency and consider future requests of the agency to enhance funding for its essential activities, including those which he has brought to our attention here today.

I strongly support his efforts to double funding for the National Institutes of Health, and I am heartened by the increases in this bill. I also want to thank him for his leadership in increasing funding for Parkinson's research and holding the September 28, 1999, hearing on the promise of Parkinson's research and the need for increased funding. Michael J. Fox put it best when he said that ``this is a winnable war'' as long as the funding is there to match the scientific promise.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I agree. At the hearing, we were asked to increase funding for Parkinson's research $75 million over current funding levels by increasing funding levels at two institutes, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), at $50 million and $25 million respectively. The research community thinks that this will provide enough funding to quicken seriously the pace of research on Parkinson's--a down payment, if you will--on a fully funded Parkinson's research agenda that scientific experts in the community conservatively estimate to be over $200 million. I believe NIH should be able to do this from the funds provided in our bill.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am sure that by now Senators have heard the news that this past weekend a key element of our national missile defense system was successfully tested when a self-guided vehicle intercepted and destroyed an intercontinental ballistic missile in outer space some 140 miles above the Pacific Ocean. 
   This test was another in a string of successes of our new missile defense technology. The test last Saturday evening follows two consecutive successful intercepts each for the PAC-3 and THAAD theater missile defense systems. 
   The timing of this good news is fortunate, coming as it does a few weeks after our intelligence community released an unclassified summary of a new intelligence estimate which shows both theater and long-range ballistic missile threats continue to grow. That summary states:  
   The proliferation of [Medium Range Ballistic Missiles]--driven primarily by North Korean No-Dong sales--has created an immediate, serious, and growing threat to U.S. forces, interests and allies in the Middle East and Asia and has significantly altered the strategic balances in those regions.  
   Our new theater missile defense systems such as PAC-3, THAAD, and the airborne laser, and the Navy's area and theaterwide systems will help redress those balances and ensure the security of our forces and our allies. 
   The summary of the new intelligence estimate also discloses that new ICBM threats to the territory of the United States could appear in a few years and that those threats may be more sophisticated than previously estimated. The summary states:  
   Russia and China each have developed numerous countermeasures and probably are willing to sell the requisite technologies.  
   It states that countries such as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq could ``develop countermeasures based on these technologies by the time they flight-test their missiles. 
   The Washington Times reported recently that China's recent test of the DF-31 ICBM employed such countermeasures, and if the Chinese are willing to share this technology with rogue states such as North Korea, as the intelligence summary estimates, the threat we face may be more sophisticated than previously anticipated. 
   The intelligence summary notes a related trend that was also illustrated in a recent news report. It states:  
   Foreign assistance continues to have demonstrable effects on missile advances around the world. Moreover, some countries that have traditionally been recipients of foreign missile technology are now sharing more amongst themselves and are pursuing cooperative missile ventures.  
   Recently, the Jerusalem Post reported Syria is, with the help of Iran, developing a new 500 kilometer-range missile based on the North Korean Scud C. According to the summary of the National Intelligence Estimate, Iran is receiving technical assistance from Russia, and North Korea from China. 
   These disturbing trends suggest the ballistic missile threat--both to our forces deployed overseas and to our homeland--continue to increase, and it makes the recent successes all the more important. I congratulate the Army, the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, and the contractor teams on their successes. 
   Saturday's success does not mean all the technical problems in our missile defense programs are solved, but the successful intercepts do confirm that the test programs are proving the technology of missile defense is maturing and that, with the appropriate resources, the talented men and women in our military and defense industries who are working on these programs are making very impressive progress on the development of workable theater and national missile defense systems. We should be very pleased with these successes and continue to support a robust missile defense program. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, tomorrow a good friend of mine is retiring after 24 years of faithful and exemplary service as primary assistant for two federal judges in my state. Virginia Anne Holtsford served first as secretary and primary assistant to Judge Orma Smith, who was United States District Judge for the Northern District of Mississippi. Upon his death she became the secretary and primary assistant to United States Fifth Circuit Appeals Court Judge E. Grady Jolly of Jackson, Mississippi. She has been with Judge Jolly from his first day on the bench, more than seventeen year ago. She is retiring to move back to her hometown of Iuka, Mississippi, to be with her mother. 
   This is how Judge Jolly described Ms. Holtsford to me: ``Anne Holtsford has a very special way of dealing with folks that has endeared her to hundreds of people who transact business with the federal courts in Mississippi and, indeed, throughout the Fifth Circuit. I believe there is no more popular and better-liked secretary in the Fifth Circuit.'' 
   All of us who have had the good fortune to know Anne Holtsford appreciate her dedicated, friendly and professional service. We will miss her very much, but certainly she deserves a wonderful retirement. 
   I join all of her many friends in commending her for a job well done and wishing her much happiness in the years ahead.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Education for Democracy Act. I am pleased that the distinguished Senator from Connecticut (Mr. DODD) has joined me as a cosponsor to reauthorize and improve existing federally supported civic education programs. 
   ``We the People ..... The Citizen and the Constitution,'' has proven to be an excellent curriculum and a successful program for teaching the principles of the Constitution. 
   Since 1985, the Center for Civic Education has administered the program. It is a rigorous course designed for high school civics classes that provides teacher training using a national network of law professionals as well as other community and business leaders. 
   The most visible component of We the People, is the simulated Congressional hearings which are competitions at local, state and national levels. The final round of this annual competition is held in an actual United States Senate or House of Representatives hearing room, here in the Nation's Capital. 
   The Popularity of We the People is demonstrated by the 82,000 teachers and the 26.5 million students who have participated since its beginning. Studies by the Education Testing Service  have repeatedly indicated that We the People participants outperform other students in every area tested. In one, We the People high school students outscored university sophomore and junior political science students in every topic.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I support the energy efficiency amendment contained in the package of amendments managed by the chairman of the subcommittee. 
   This amendment, which I have sponsored along with Senators MURKOWSKI and BINGAMAN, clarifies, with respect to the measurement of energy use by the Federal government, that the directives contained in Presidential Executive Order 13123 cannot circumvent or contradict any relevant statues. 
   The Appropriations Committee addressed this matter last year, when Senator MURKOWSKI and Senator BYRD worked to clarify the intent of Congress with respect to energy use and energy measurement. As a result of their efforts, the conference report on the Omnibus Appropriations bill included language that has the same effect as the amendment we propose today--that is, the federal government shall obey existing laws, that proposed changes to the law are subject to the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and that the law cannot be changed by committee report language, executive order or any other mechanism that would circumvent the jurisdiction of the authorizing committee. 
   Mr. President, this amendment will remedy flaws in the Executive Order, most of which represents a laudable effort to save taxpayer dollars by increasing energy efficiency in federal buildings. 
   I thank Chairman GORTON, Energy Committee Chairman MURKOWSKI, ranking member BINGAMAN, and their staffs for working to resolve this issue.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the National Missile Defense Act makes it the policy of the United States to deploy a limited national missile defense system as soon as the technology to do so is ready. This act was passed by large margins in both Houses. Because the Anti-Ballistic Missile or ABM Treaty prohibits such a system, that treaty must be modified. 
   That point was made in the debate on the National Missile Defense Act in the Senate, and it is the reason why administration officials have engaged the Russian Government in discussions on modifying the treaty. These discussions began last month in Moscow, and I am pleased that staff members of the Senate's National Security Working Group were able to attend and be briefed on the progress of those talks. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is in Moscow for further negotiations on this and other important issues. 
   But I am very disturbed by reported comments of Russian officials on this subject. Today, for example, it was reported that Mr. Roman Popkovich, Chairman of the Defense Committee of the Russian Parliament, said that if the United States builds a missile defense system, Russia may respond by ``developing an entirely new kind of offensive weapon.'' Mr. Popkovich was also quoted in this story as saying, ``No anti-missile defense will be able to stop our new missiles.'' 
   His are not the first such comments we have heard about modifying the ABM Treaty. The lead Russian negotiator, Grigory Berdennikov, said the mere raising of the issue meant ``the arms race could now leap to outer space.'' Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of International Cooperation in the Russian Ministry of Defense, said that modifying the treaty ``would be to destroy the entire process of nuclear arms control.'' 
   I don't know the motivations for such statements, but I believe they deserve a response. There should be no misunderstanding of our Nation's intentions with respect to national missile defense. We face a real and growing threat of ballistic missile attack from rogue states or outlaw nations. That threat is advancing, often in unanticipated ways. The U.S. Government has a duty to protect its citizens from this threat. 
   It is our policy, which is now set in law, to deploy a system to defend against limited attack by ballistic missiles as soon as technologically possible. The system we intend to deploy in no way threatens the strategic retaliatory force of Russia. The ABM Treaty, an agreement between two nuclear superpowers engaged in an arms buildup in 1972, prohibits such a system and must be modernized. I am sure Russian officials know all of this. They have been briefed repeatedly on the U.S. assessment of the threat. They have been briefed repeatedly on U.S. plans for national missile defense and know as well as we do that the system we contemplate is not directed at Russia and poses no threat to its forces.  
   So the statements of Mr. Popkovich and the other Russian officials essentially threatening an arms race if the U.S. does what it must do to protect its citizens are very disappointing. They sound like something from the past, an echo of the cold war that is over. 
   The United States has embarked in good faith in discussions about the need to modernize the ABM Treaty. We negotiated in good faith with Russia when it demanded changes to the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty in order to enable Russia to adapt to changed circumstances. It would be unfortunate if the United States were put in the position of choosing between defending its citizens and adhering to an outdated agreement because we have already determined that we will defend ourselves. 
   I am confident the Senate will not accept an arrangement in which the U.S. continues to be vulnerable to new threats because of a 27-year-old agreement that is so clearly out of date. What is needed now is for the rhetoric to be cooled, for threats about arms races and new missiles to be set aside, and let serious and fruitful discussions proceed. It is in not only our interest for that to happen but Russia's as well. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the comments from my colleagues from Louisiana. Both of my colleagues can rest assured that I will keep these issues clearly in focus as we deliberate the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill in conference with the other body. Additionally, I am aware of the many other important past and present research projects ongoing at the Southern Regional Research Center. This is an excellent agriculture research center, and funding for its work should be carefully considered by the conference committee.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today the Senate resumes consideration of the Agriculture appropriations bill and, by previous order, will begin 40 minutes of debate on the dairy amendment, to be followed by a cloture vote at 9:45 a.m. Following the vote, the Senate will resume consideration of the pending Ashcroft amendment. Further amendments and votes are expected throughout today's session of the Senate with the anticipation of completing action on the bill. 
   For the remainder of the week, the majority leader has asked it be announced that he hopes the Senate can complete action on the tax reconciliation conference report and the Interior appropriations bill. Therefore, Senators should expect votes throughout the day and into the evenings prior to adjourning for the August recess.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment relating to economic and disaster assistance. This is the amendment that the Senate voted against tabling when a motion to table the amendment was made by the distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. DASCHLE. 
   A vote has already been taken on a motion to table this amendment, but it was then, under leadership agreement on how to proceed to this bill, withdrawn. 
   This action that has just been taken puts this amendment back before the Senate. There was an amendment offered by the Democratic leader and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, which was also the subject of a motion to table. That motion to table was agreed to. 
   Before the Senate now is the issue of economic and disaster assistance for farmers in the form of the so-called Cochran amendment. 
   To refresh the memory of Senators, this is an amendment that seeks to give the Secretary of Agriculture authority and funds with which to deal with the economic crisis that exists in production agriculture today. This is funding for the fiscal year that begins next October 1, so it is not an endeavor to deal with all of the existing problems in agriculture in the current fiscal year, but it is an effort to deal with economic problems during the harvesting and marketing of the 1999 crop throughout the country. 
   There is already in place a $6 billion disaster program that was approved last year that has been administered by the Department. Some of those checks for weather-related disasters went out to farmers as recently as June. We are hopeful if any additional funds are needed for this crop-year, the President will submit a budget request asking for additional funds. 
   There has been some discussion during the debate on the floor that there is nothing in this amendment that provides immediate assistance for drought victims and the like. The point is, in a recent supplemental that we had on funding the military action in Kosovo, that subject was raised and an amendment was offered, which was rejected, that would provide additional disaster assistance funds in this crop-year and in the next crop-year as well. What we did was adopt the sense-of-the-Senate language that would ask the President to submit a supplemental request if additional funds were needed over and above that amount that had already been provided by the Congress. No request has been made. 
   A letter was written to the President in June, signed by 22 Senators, reiterating the fact that we approved language requesting a supplemental request if one was needed and that nothing had been heard. We did get an acknowledgment to the letter, but we have had no subsequent request. 
   The chairman of the Agriculture Committee, the Senator from Indiana, Mr. LUGAR, has been having hearings in the Senate Agriculture Committee, yesterday and again today, getting information, getting expert advice and testimony on the condition of agriculture in America today to determine what level of assistance is appropriate, what level is needed, and what kind and character should this assistance take. We have had a long debate. Senators on both sides have expressed their views on this subject, and we are at a point now where we have to either adopt an amendment or not adopt an amendment providing disaster assistance. 
   It seems to me it would be appropriate now, after hearing all the evidence, after reviewing all the arguments, to proceed with the adoption of this amendment and go to conference with the House and try to resolve whatever differences we may have on this issue with House conferees and then come back with a conference report for the consideration of the Senate. If we do not have a provision for  disaster or economic assistance in our bill, this will not be an item that can be considered in conference. So I think it is very important for the Senate to approve this amendment, giving us a conference vehicle for further consideration of this issue with the House. If we do not approve this amendment or some other amendment that could be offered, then we will not have a vehicle. 
   We have already expressed our views as a body on the Daschle-Harkin proposal. It was rejected. This amendment was not rejected. The motion to table was not agreed to. So it is now back before the Senate for its consideration. 
   I am going to review briefly what this legislation contains and urge Senators to approve the amendment. We can have a record vote on that if the Senate desires or we can adopt it on a voice vote. It suits me to adopt it on a voice vote, but I am putting Senators on notice that is the issue before the Senate now. If anyone wants to request a record vote, they are free, of course, to come to the Senate floor and do that. 
   The bulk of the funds provided in this amendment--which now has a cost estimated by the Congressional Budget Office of almost $7 billion--the bulk of the assistance is in the form of 
   increased payments, so-called AMTA payments. That is the agricultural market transition payments. These are payments that are made to commodity producers under existing farm law, provided to help farmers make the transition from a Government-controlled and mandated agricultural production system to a more open and free market system where farmers can make their own decisions about what they plant on their crop acreage. In the past, the Government had tight controls over not only what crops could be subsidized by the Government, but how much acreage could be planted with those crops. If you violated the rules, you lost your right to Federal assistance. 
   Under the new program, Federal assistance is provided without regard to what crop you plant or how much of the acreage you use. There is no mandatory set-aside of acreage, telling farmers you cannot plant but so much of your acreage this year, as was the case under preexisting agricultural legislation. The amount of money that would be paid directly to farmers as authorized in this legislation would represent 100 percent of the total of the 1999 producers AMTA payment. So in effect, by the passage of this amendment, we would double the amount of money that would go to farmers who are entitled to agriculture market transition assistance payments. That comes to a total of $5.54 billion. There is no redtape. There is no discretion in the Department of Agriculture. There is no special procedure for establishing eligibility. If you are eligible under current law for a transition payment, you are eligible for this additional payment. The checks go out. 
   It was shown in the experience this year in administering the current disaster assistance program that the AMTA payment system was the most efficient way of providing assistance to farmers who were entitled to add additional benefits under an economic assistance program. So that is why in this amendment we have elected to use that vehicle to disseminate funds for disaster and economic assistance to farmers because of this year's economic stress in agriculture. But not all farmers are eligible for AMTA payments. Because they are not, most of the rest of the funds in the bill are used for disaster assistance for those farmers that they may need. 
   The Secretary of Agriculture is, for example, given discretion to establish a program to provide assistance to livestock and dairy producers. There is a livestock assistance program in place now which was utilized to deliver disaster assistance provided last year. So, because of that experience, it seems logical that the Department of Agriculture will be able to provide regulatory guidance and eligibility standards for those who suffered by reason of drought or other conditions that have adversely affected them if they are in the livestock business. This applies to beef cattle production; it applies to hog production; and it applies to dairy. 
   So it is a program that is included in this legislation. Other specialty crops are included as well--fruits and vegetables. Other crops and other commodities that are grown by landowners who are involved in production agriculture are intended to be included in this program, and the Secretary of Agriculture is given the authority to use funds appropriated in this amendment to provide assistance to those farmers as well. 
   We do not try to pick and choose among farmers, whether you are eligible or not eligible for benefits. The intent is we want all farmers to benefit from this program under this amendment. 
   There is also, at the conclusion of our bill, a provision that states the sense of the Congress with respect to a more aggressive policy with agricultural trade issues. There have been situations that have developed around the world where our producers and exporters have been shut out of markets or have been discriminated against because of tariffs or other rules and regulations adopted by other countries or groups of countries that have made it impossible for us to have access to markets that we have traditionally enjoyed or which we ought to by right have an opportunity to enjoy. 
   We are urging the administration to be more aggressive in strengthening trade negotiating authority for American agriculture, and we express Congress' objectives for future trade negotiations. We ask the President to evaluate and make recommendations on the effectiveness of our existing export and food aid programs. 
   I think we have heard enough about what the facts are. Senators who have been to their own States have had an opportunity to view the situation, to talk with their farmers, and to understand the stress that is confronting American agriculture today. 
   Here are some of the Department of Agriculture's own facts and estimates that had been given to our subcommittee when we had our hearings earlier this year: 1999 net cash farm income is expected to decline $3.6 billion below last year's level. Incidentally, in 1998, net farm income for wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, and rice was 17 percent below the previous 5-year average. For this crop-year, 1999, the projections indicate that income for the same crops will be 27 percent below the previous 5-year average. 
   Those are the projections that persuade me that disaster and economic assistance is not only important for us to consider but is necessary for us to deliver if we have the expectation of maintaining health and vitality in American agriculture. 
   I think the facts are clear and justify the amendment we are offering today to provide disaster assistance and economic assistance to agricultural producers for the 1999 crop-year. The bulk of the assistance is going to be made available in the most efficient way possible: through the disbursement of the market transition payments providing a 100-percent bonus, in effect, to all who are eligible for those payments. 
   Those who are soybean farmers or who grow other oilseeds will be entitled to benefits under a special program. They do not receive these transition payments, but they will receive benefits under this amendment. The same is true of livestock farmers, whether they are beef cattle, pork producers, or dairymen. 
   We think we have created a balanced program, one that is fair to all farmers, one that will help put money in the pockets of farmers, not just give them a promise of loans or technical assistance or other advice from the Government. Our amendment does not just add money to Government agencies; it does not just increase the size of Government agencies; it sends the money directly to the producers. 
   We have also agreed to add to this bill, at the request of other Senators, additional funds for crop insurance benefits. That was not included in the original amendment that was offered as a part of the Cochran amendment, but it will be added to this amendment in the form of a modification. We have heard the persuasive arguments in support of that suggestion, and we have agreed to accommodate those Senators who are interested in that additional benefit. 
   My hope is Senators will review the amendment as we are modifying the amendment and will support it, and we can then move on to the final conclusion of this legislation.  
   Mr. President, if there is no Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, this is the modification that I mentioned in my remarks, when I sent the Cochran amendment to the desk, that we were making to add $400 million for the Crop Insurance Program to the Cochran amendment. There are other technical changes, but that is the substantive change that is made by this modification, for the information of Senators. 
   We are also hopeful, after talking with the distinguished Democratic leader, that it is possible we will be able to move to a vote on the Cochran amendment--the details of that are being discussed now with leaders on both sides and interested Senators --and then consider any other amendments that may be offered on this subject--we know of two suggested major amendments that may still be presented to the Senate for its consideration--to have votes on those or on motions to table those amendments, and then move on to consideration of other amendments which have been suggested by Senators. 
   We have a list of amendments the managers have agreed to accept. There are a few that we know of that Senators have indicated an interest in offering which we are not able to accept, but we hope that if there are Senators who have amendments they intend to offer, they will let us know about this. We have asked each Cloakroom to try to find out what we can expect in the way of additional amendments because we would like to conclude action on this bill this afternoon or early this evening. We think that is certainly possible under the arrangement that has just been discussed with the managers by the Democratic leader. 
   We appreciate the cooperation of all Senators.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I don't know of any Senators on this side of the aisle who desire to debate this issue any further. We have had a full debate of all of the issues surrounding this amendment--the issues of disaster and income assistance. 
   I observe that the proposal that is now before the Senate, offered by the Senators from North Dakota and Iowa and others who may be cosponsors, is very similar to the amendment that has already been voted on, on a motion to table the Daschle-Harkin amendment. On that vote, the motion to table was agreed to.  
   There are some reductions in the individual items of assistance that are included in the bill, but the bill is basically the same bill substantively and in terms of the procedures used to deliver the disaster assistance. We were told also that the earlier bill had been estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost over $11 billion. It had been advertised as having a cost of $10.793 billion. This has been revised downward from that previous estimate to $9.83 billion. 
   The individual items we observe that have been changed: There is $100 million less for dairy. There is a reduction in the livestock assistance program from $200 million to $150 million. There was a so-called flooded land program at $250 million in the earlier proposal which is now $150 million. There is a cancellation of the so-called emergency short-term land diversion program and also of the producers erroneously denied eligibility for the 1998 relief program. There are two programs in the emergency conservation area that have been reduced in cost, and one has been canceled. 
   Those are the highlights of the changes that have been made in this legislation from the way it appeared when the Senate voted to table the amendment earlier in the consideration of this bill. So it is virtually the same amendment. There have been some modifications. 
   I urge Senators to vote to table the amendment when that motion is made. It is the intention of this manager to yield back all time that remains on this side, and I will be prepared to do that whenever the Senator from North Dakota says they are ready to vote.

   I make that suggestion to see if it is satisfactory with the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I know of no Senators on this side who are requesting recognition to debate this amendment. I observe that there has been a lot of discussion and consideration in the Senate on all of the issues that are included in this proposed amendment. Nothing really has been changed except the vehicle for delivery of assistance--that has been changed--and a reduction in total cost. 
   We still observe this is not a CBO estimate of the cost. The earliest cost of the Harkin amendment was over $10 billion, but then CBO sends us an estimate and it is over $11 billion. So one thing for Senators to keep in mind is that the cost of this proposed amendment is still considerably higher than the Cochran amendment that has previously been agreed to by the Senate on a voice vote this afternoon. 
   I hope Senators will continue to support the managers' effort to table this amendment and proceed to then consider the remaining amendments we have available to be disposed of in connection with this legislation. We think the underlying amendment fully addresses the need for action to deal with the problem of lost income and disaster assistance. It may not be perfect. There is no provision in the House bill on this subject. So we have an opportunity in conference to work out differences. If there are developments between now and the time when we do go to conference with the House, we will have an opportunity to address those issues. 
   I am hopeful Senators will understand this is our first action on this subject by the Congress. We have had no support from the administration in terms of trying to identify an appropriate level of disaster assistance for current problems. We already have a disaster program that is still being administered by the Department of Agriculture which was approved in the last Congress. That is a $6 billion program. We are willing to continue to work with the administration and with Senators in this Chamber to design the best possible economic assistance program. 
   We think this is a very strong effort and is a sign that we are serious about dealing with the problems in agriculture. It is a strong commitment. It is a $7 billion effort that has already been agreed to this afternoon. So we will continue to talk to Senators on both sides of the aisle to try to reach a point where we have a consensus and we have an understanding that will be acceptable not only to Congress but get the signature of the White House as well. We realize that is a fact of legislative life. But this is an important issue. 
   We appreciate the way Senators have responded to the challenge, discussing the options and voting for the measures that have been before us. But it is my intention, once the Senator has used his time or yielded it back, to yield the time that remains on this side and move to table the amendment.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am happy to discuss this. I do not think we are going to make any progress in reaching an agreement in the way the Senator from Nebraska has undertaken to try to explore the options. This is, is it the third day? It seems as if it has been 3 days. Maybe it has just been 2. Time passes so fast when you are having fun trying to work something out. 
   We have undertaken in good faith to try to arrive at a package of assistance that will address the needs, as we understand them, in agriculture. If the Senator has listened to the debate, as I am sure he has, there have been some Senators who do not think there should be any funds made available at this time for this purpose because the harvests have not been completed and we do not know what the losses are in some areas of the country. 
   This year, some farmers are predicted to make more money than they did last year. In my State, aquaculture is considered to be having a very good year. There was a big feature story just this week in our State's press about that. But there are some farmers who are having a terrible time. Many of them are in the newspapers and photographs where drought has hit crops in this region of the country. 
   We are all aware of those problems. To suggest to me that I should now look at this last amendment that has a  long list of things in it and I should select things that I could be willing to accept puts me in a position that is really untenable. I think the Senator understands that. So I think his questions are not only facetious but not well intended to really achieve the result of a compromise. 
   I cannot speak for all Senators on this side of the aisle 
   when trying to respond to a question such as that. I can say that there is a lot of diversity in the Senate. We have come together to agree on an approach. It is a generous approach, and I think we are willing to go to conference with that. I am willing to take that to conference and defend it and improve it if we can, if the House has some better ideas.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have been asked to seek unanimous consent that it be in order to reoffer the Ashcroft amendment regarding sanctions, that the amendment be considered agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. 
   I announce that I have been asked to seek that consent. I know a copy of the agreement has been furnished to staff on both sides, and it has been hotlined. I don't have a response as to whether it has been agreed to. So I am raising the question as to whether or not that consent can be granted.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri and others who were interested in the sanctions amendment that he had offered and which had been approved in a different form earlier in the consideration of the bill for working to put this legislation together in a form that could be adopted by the Senate tonight. I know the Senators from Florida and New Jersey were interested in this legislation, and the author of the amendment has shown strong leadership in bringing this issue to the Senate and in pushing it the way he did to get it approved. I compliment him and those who worked with him to try to resolve this issue.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think progress is being made by the  managers and our staff members with those Senators who have suggested amendments to the bill. We are compiling a list of amendments that will be agreed upon. There are a few that have not been resolved and that probably will require either disposition by voice vote or rollcall vote either up or down or on a motion to table. 
   I am just suggesting we are getting to that point toward the end of the bill when we are ready to wrap this up. We hope we are not in too late tonight. If Senators will cooperate and offer the amendments they have, we will appreciate that very much.

I know of no other amendments that are going to be offered to that amendment. The bill will be open for amendment further upon the adoption of that amendment. It is an amendment that has already been voted on twice, once on a motion to table and then adopted on a voice vote. I am prepared to move forward to dispose of that disaster assistance issue. 
   I am awaiting the advice of the Chair. Do we have to have third reading? If we do, I will request it.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the only amendment that I am aware of that has not already been agreed to by the managers or a recommendation to the Senate for agreement is the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina. Senator THURMOND has an amendment. After his amendment is offered--and it will be accepted--we have a group of amendments that we can recommend be agreed to by the Senate. I know of no other controversial amendment that would require a recorded vote. 
   Then it would be up to the Senate whether to accept passage of the bill on a voice vote or insist on a recorded vote. I have had no one ask me to request the yeas and nays on final passage. So if that is an understanding that is agreeable to the Senate, we will proceed to accept the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina, then the agreed-upon list the managers will recommend, and then adopt the bill on final passage by voice vote. 
   If there is any objection to that, speak up now. 
   Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.

   Mr. COCHRAN. I understand that my colleagues from Maine have a deep interest in furthering cold-water aquaculture research on marine species, especially since cold water aquaculture is an important industry in their State. In marking up the FY2000 appropriations, the committee considered the need for the Agricultural Research Service to update warmwater aquaculture research activities and in our report language, directed the ARS to submit to the committee by January 31, 2000, a report that will not only update warmwater aquaculture research  activities but also to include all aquaculture research currently being conducted by the agency. The report language also requires the agency to address the agency's current capacity and requirements for additional resources to meet future needs and issues confronting the Nation's aquaculture farmers, including opportunities in rural America. I agree that cold water aquaculture research needs are included in the overall mandate of the report language. I also believe the ARS report will be helpful in establishing the need for coldwater aquaculture research for marine species.

I thank the Senator for his comments and I assure him that I share his concern that we must fight to ensure that our commodities are not unfairly discriminated against in markets around the world. We cannot allow our soybean farmers, cotton farmers, corn farmers and others to have their exports put at risk by unfair regulation. We cannot cede any markets to GMO opponents. I share his desire to see USDA put the necessary resources into ensuring our interests are adequately represented as the nations of Southeast Asia consider regulation. I assure him that I will look into the status of these activities and seek to have them adequately funded.

   Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for raising the issue of enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act and for pointing out many of the terrible conditions for which this Act is designed to halt and efforts by USDA and this Congress to put an end to them. The Senator is correct that funding for this activity has remained constant over the past several years. The President included in his budget request for fiscal year 2000 an increase of $515,000 for these activities. 
   The President's request would provide additional funds for enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act, but only to maintain current activities such as inspections at regulated facilities to ensure compliance with the Act. In addition, inspectors would receive much needed training to ensure uniform enforcement of the regulations and to stay current with industry advancements in methodologies of research and caring for animals. APHIS would continue to replace outdated and old equipment including vehicles and continue modernizing its computer databases program. In view of the needs outlined in the budget request, and the overall problems outlined by the Senator from Wisconsin, this bill includes an increase of $2 million above last years level, nearly four times the amount of increase requested by the President.

Yes, the committee understands that certain types of pathogens present low risks and research education facilities should face minimal regulatory burden as deemed appropriate by the Secretary of Agriculture. The Committee would also urge APHIS to develop laboratory standards for facilities and management practices that will enable research and education facilities to handle higher-risk pathogens as well. These laboratory standards will help APHIS use its resources more efficiently and allow efficient use of research resources to combat plant diseases more effectively.

   On page 96 of the report, the chart regarding the rural economic development loans program account should not footnote the Committee recommendation. The Committee's recommendation for the direct loan subsidy is not offset by a rescission from interest on the cushion of credit payments, as authorized by section 313 of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. 
   On page 133 of the report, Bill Emerson and Mickey Leland Hunger Fellowships should be added to the list of programs which currently lack authorization for fiscal year 2000.

His leadership is legendary. His influence in this body continues to be very important. We are grateful for his continued service in the Senate. 
   I also want to commend members of our staffs who have been so diligent and so effective in the handling of the duties they have assumed in connection with the development of this legislation and the passage of the bill. I specifically want to commend: Mark Keenum, my chief of staff; Rebecca Davies, chief clerk of the subcommittee; Hunt Shipman, Martha Scott Poindexter, Les Spivey, and Buddy Allen. They have all been very helpful and very conscientious and discharged their responsibilities in a professional and very praiseworthy way. I am deeply grateful for their good help. 
   On the Democratic side of the aisle, my good friend and colleague from Wisconsin is serving as a manager of this bill for the first time. He has done a great job helping us sort through the requests and the amendments that have been suggested in helping guide this bill to passage. We have not agreed on everything, but we worked through our disagreements in a cordial way. I appreciate very much his leadership on the Democratic side and the way he has handled his responsibilities. 
   I also want to thank the staff members who have worked on the Democratic side on this bill: Paul Bock, who is the chief of staff of Senator KOHL; Kate Sparks, his legislative director; Galen Fountain, who is an experienced member of the subcommittee staff, having worked for Senator Bumpers and others since his time here as a member of the Senate staff; and Carole Geagley.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for his willingness to let the Senate resume the bill. I appreciate very much also his efforts to try to identify the ways we can develop a comprehensive response to the disaster situation and the economic crisis that exists in agriculture today. 
   Last evening, before the Senate adjourned, the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Mr. LUGAR, spoke for about 30 minutes, focusing the attention of the Senate, as we should be focused, on the difficulties of designing a plan to deal with this problem in agriculture that affects all commodities, all regions of the country, because there are disparities around the country in terms of economic losses, weather-related damages to crops, and market influences in the agricultural sector. All of that means some farmers are doing fairly well. 
   There was an article in my home State press yesterday, as a matter of fact, talking about the aquacultural industry in the State of Mississippi, and what a good year those who are producing farm-raised fish are having in comparison with the other agricultural producers in our State. 
   This is probably replicated in many other States. Some farmers are having a good year but many are not. We are trying to identify ways we can design a program of special assistance to deal with those catastrophic situations where the Government does need to respond. It is my hope we can design a disaster program that sends money directly to farmers who need financial assistance rather than create larger Government programs with money going into the bureaucracy, or expanding conservation programs, as the first-degree amendment would do, and instead opt for the alternative that is the second-degree amendment which I have offered that sends the money directly to farmers. 
   I was called this morning by one of the network radio news reporters and was asked whether or not the program we are recommending is more loans for farmers. Farmers, he had heard, do not want more loans. I assured him that is not what we were proposing. We are not proposing that farmers be given more loans. We are proposing that they be given more money, direct payments, using the vehicle of the existing farm legislation that gives authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to make direct payments to farmers in the form of transition payments. We are doubling the amount of the transition payments in this second-degree amendment. That makes up the bulk of the dollar cost of the second-degree amendment as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. 
   So I think we are on the right track in trying to identify the best way to help farmers who are in an emergency situation, to identify those who are in an emergency and to give them money in direct payments in this special situation. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Rather than agree to that, and I think it is a good idea to go back and forth from one side of the aisle to the other, we do not have a time agreement, and I think it is a mistake now to try to get a time agreement. Senator GRASSLEY, I know, was on the floor making notes a while ago. He stepped off the floor just now. I wouldn't want to jeopardize his right. He has been here for some time this morning. 
   I hope what we can do is, if the Senator from Kansas can proceed as suggested by the Senator from Minnesota, and then the Senator from Minnesota, at that time we can take a look and see who wants to speak. But I know the Senator from North Dakota is interested in this debate and participated in the debate yesterday. We look forward to hearing his comments again today.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor and to support the passage of the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act, S. 335. This legislation would establish new safeguards to protect consumers against deceptive and dishonest sweepstakes and other promotional mailings. The bill grants additional investigative and enforcement authority to the U.S. Postal Service to stop deceptive mailings, 
   and it establishes standards for all sweepstakes mailings by requiring certain disclosures on each mailing. 
   In the last Congress, our subcommittee examined the use of mass mail to deceive and defraud consumers. At the subcommittee's hearing, we heard how sweepstakes and other promotions were causing individuals to make unwanted or excessive purchases in the hope that the purchases would increase their chances of winning money or other prizes. Since conducting that hearing, the subcommittee has been flooded with stories from consumers all over the country who have lost thousands of dollars in some cases--sometimes their life savings--to deceptive mailing practices. But it is not just sweepstakes offers that deceive consumers. Some mailers imply an association with the Government, often enticing consumers to pay unnecessary fees. 
   This bill will address several types of deceptive mailings, including sweepstakes and Government look-alike mailings. 
   First, it will require sweepstakes mailings to display a statement that no purchase is necessary to enter the contest and that a purchase will not improve the chances of winning. Other disclosures will also be required, including the sponsor of the sweepstakes and the principal place of business or an address at which the sponsor can be reached, and the estimated odds of winning each prize and the estimated value of each prize. In addition, all terms and conditions of the sweepstakes promotion, including the rules and entry procedures for the sweepstakes, will be required on each mailing. 
   Second, the bill will expand the authority of the U.S. Postal Service by granting the Postal Inspection Service subpoena authority, nationwide stop-mail authority, and the ability to impose civil penalties of up to $1 million for the first offense and $2 million for a violation of an existing order. 
   Finally, the bill will strengthen existing law regarding Government look-alike mailings by requiring disclaimers on any mailings that might be interpreted as implying a connection to the Federal Government. 
   This legislation was reported out of the Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services on April 12 and reported unanimously by the Committee on Governmental Affairs on May 20. It has the support of the U.S. Postal Service, a number of consumer groups, and the American Association of Retired Persons. 
   I commend the work of the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. COLLINS, in crafting this legislation to curb deceptive mailings. As chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Senator COLLINS has thoroughly examined the issue, and I applaud her important efforts in developing this bill and her continuing efforts to protect consumers. The distinguished ranking minority member of the committee, Senator LEVIN, has also supported this initiative, and we appreciate his assistance. 
   This bill takes an important step toward the prevention of deception in sweepstakes and other promotional mailings. I urge Senators to support it.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, as I understand the parliamentary situation at this time, pending before the Senate is a second-degree amendment to an amendment offered on behalf of the Democratic leader to provide disaster assistance and economic assistance to our Nation's farmers. 
   The amendment, which is the amendment in the second degree offered by the majority leader on my behalf, provides a wide range of benefits to individual farmers and ranchers who, under the terms of this legislation, are eligible for disaster assistance because of economic losses and disasters that have occurred by reason of vagaries in the weather and other conditions that will cause these farmers to undergo unusual hardship. 
   We think this amendment is better and a more sensitive approach to the real needs of those involved in production agriculture than the proposal coming from the Democratic leader. Here is why. Most of the funds that are appropriated in this amendment for economic and disaster assistance go directly to the agriculture producer who has been victimized by floods or drought or economic catastrophes affecting his ability to earn a profit this year. 
   On the other hand, much of the assistance that is appropriated or funded in the Democrats' package goes to continue or expand Federal programs, to enlarge programs. In other words, the money is going to the Government to expand and administer programs that either have to work, in some cases, or really do nothing to improve the farmer's ability to derive 
   income from his labor. So that is a major distinction that I hope Senators will consider as they try to decide which of these proposals to support. 
   As Senators know, most of the funds that go to protect income, or support the production of agriculture commodities in our country, are in the form of assistance called AMTA payments. These payments are transition payments that were begun under the last farm bill to prepare farmers for the time when predictable subsidies under the old farm bill program are reduced and then finally eliminated. Over this 5-year period under this new farm law, the transition payments are made to help support farmers as they become accustomed to agriculture without the benefit of the old subsidy payments. Farmers are now free to make planting decisions, for example, for themselves, as indicated by the condition of the market and the likelihood of crops being productive and efficiently produced, rather than what the Government tells them they should produce under the restraints of Federal law. 
   Many farmers are beginning to make these decisions and shift from one program crop to another, without running the risk of losing Federal Government support. In order to show that the economic conditions and the market conditions have been so severe as to cause farmers not to be able to operate profitably under the new transition payment system, that payment is doubled under the Cochran amendment. And so instead of receiving $5,000 as a transition payment, a person who is entitled to that benefit under existing law this year will get twice that amount as an economic assistance payment from the Federal Government. A total of $5.54 billion will be paid to agriculture producers for market transition payments under the Cochran amendment. This is a 100 percent increase in a producer's 1999 payment under the existing farm bill. 
   Other benefits that are available to agriculture producers under this amendment would include $500 million in direct payments to soybean and oilseed producers; $350 million in assistance to livestock and dairy producers, to be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture. The amendment would also suspend the budget deficit reduction assessment on sugar producers for the remainder of the farm bill, as long as no Federal budget deficit exists. 
   There will be a direct payment provided in this amendment to producers of quota and non-quota peanuts, equal to 5 percent of the current loan rate. The Cotton Step Two Export Program is reinstated in this amendment. There is an increase in the current loan deficiency payment limit from $75,000 to  $150,000. There is, additionally, a provision in this bill that expresses the sense of the Congress, encouraging the President to be more aggressive in strengthening trade negotiating authority for American agriculture and expressing the Congress' objectives for future agriculture trade negotiations. The amendment also requests that the President evaluate and make recommendations on the effectiveness of our existing export and food aid programs. 
   If you add up all of the direct benefits that are payable, they have been scored by the Congressional Budget Office as amounting to a total of $6.67 billion for fiscal year 2000. The added cost over the next 3 years, from 2000 to 2004, would add another $309 million to the cost of the bill, for a total of $6.979 billion in total cost from fiscal year 2000 to 2004, as scored by the Congressional Budget Office. 
   Madam President, Senators will remember that when we first brought this bill from the committee to the floor of the Senate, there was a great deal of concern about whether or not there should be a disaster program included in a title of the bill. We had asked the administration to submit a budget request for any funds that were expected to be needed. We have had no response whatsoever from the administration to that request. We attached that as an amendment in the Committee on Appropriations. We discussed it on the floor of the Senate when this bill was before the Senate earlier, and I am very distressed that we have yet to hear any request made by the administration for this assistance. So in spite of the absence of cooperation in trying to identify and work together on a program that would be sensitive to the problems in production agriculture, we are moving to suggest to the Senate that this is a program that ought to be adopted. 
   I have additional comments to make. I will be glad to respond to questions that may arise from Senators on the content of this legislation to try to answer any questions that others may have. But I know we will soon have a vote that is scheduled to occur on another bill that was debated in the Senate earlier today. In an effort to accommodate friends who have asked for time to talk on their amendment, I will yield the floor at this time so other Senators may speak.

   Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator from Iowa asked unanimous consent before we permitted discussion of the Collins bill that he be recognized following the vote. 
   I am rising to clarify the situation, and also to inquire how long the distinguished Senator is planning to speak at this point. I am hopeful that there will be time for the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Mr. LUGAR, who is chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, to speak for about 30 minutes. He has to chair a committee hearing in the morning beginning at 9 o'clock and won't be available tomorrow morning. I am hopeful the Senator will either let Senator LUGAR proceed now or after a reasonable time for the Senator to then be recognized for 30 minutes. 
   That is the purpose of my inquiry of the Senator from Iowa. I did not object when the Senator sought unanimous consent to be recognized because I thought I had talked about 15 minutes and the Senator had talked about the same period of time, or maybe a little longer. That is the purpose of my inquiry.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am submitting today a resolution which commends General Wesley K. Clark for his outstanding service to the United States. I am pleased to be joined by Mr. MCCAIN and Mr. STEVENS as cosponsors of the resolution. 
   I was sorry to learn from the Wednesday morning's newspapers that General Clark would be leaving his current post, where he serves simultaneously as the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe and as Commander-in-Chief of the United States European Command, before his tour was scheduled to end. When General Clark retires next year, the United States will be losing one of its finest officers. And I say that not just because of what he just accomplished in successfully leading NATO forces into battle for the first time, but because of the exemplary record General Clark compiled over 33 years of service to our Nation. 
   Wes Clark graduated first in his class from West Point in 1966, and was selected to attend Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. After graduating from Oxford General Clark distinguished himself in Vietnam, where he commanded a mechanized infantry company in combat. General Clark went on to command two other companies, as well as an armor battalion at Fort Carson, Colorado, a brigade in the 4th Infantry Division, also at Fort Carson, the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, the 1st Calvary Division at Fort Hood, Texas, and the United States Southern Command, headquartered in Panama. 
   I won't list the numerous staff jobs in which General Clark has served, but I do point out that General Clark, as the Director of Strategic Plans and Policy on the Joint Staff, was integral to the formulation of the Bosnian Peace Accords, negotiated in Dayton. In reviewing the numerous positions General Clark has held since he graduated from West Point, it is beyond question that Wes Clark is an officer who has served our Nation well during the last 33 years. 
   I recently had a chance to visit with General Clark at his headquarters in Brussels. Despite months of getting little sleep, I'm told it was about four hours per night, General Clark was able to explain to me clearly and in detail our military operations in Kosovo and Serbia. His grasp of every nuance of every plan and option, was evident, and only reinforced his reputation for thoroughness. Nothing demonstrates his reputation for thoroughness and resourcefulness. Nothing demonstrates this more clearly than one simple fact: In an environment where General Clark was operating under severe constraints, he led NATO forces to victory. He was tireless; he was imaginative; and ultimately, he was victorious. 
   This resolution commends General Clark and expresses the Senate's gratitude to him not just because of his recent service, but because of his lifetime of service. General Clark deserves recognition not only for achieving results, but also for his personal integrity. His record of saying what he believes should be said without respect to whether that is what other people necessarily want to hear is an example that others should seek to emulate. 
   General Wes Clark has had a career distinguished by exemplary and dedicated service to our Nation. I urge the adoption of the Senate of this resolution.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this morning I noticed in the Washington Times newspaper that President Clinton has signed the bill we authored here in the Senate, the National Missile Defense Act. This is very important legislation which the Senate passed after a lot of debate. The House and the Senate then reconciled differences between the House-passed measure and the Senate bill and sent the bill to the President. 
   The President made a statement in connection with his signing the bill which raises some questions that I thought should be addressed by a comment this morning. After talking about the fact that he is signing the bill to address the growing danger that rogue nations may develop and field long-range missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies, he then has this to say in his message. He is referring to the fact that authorization and appropriations measures will  be a part of the process in terms of when and how and to what extent the funding is available for national missile defense.  
   This interpretation, which is confirmed by the legislative record taken as a whole, is also required to avoid a possible impairment of my constitutional authorities.  
   The President is suggesting that the bill doesn't mean what it says. I think that has to be brought to the attention of the Senate. The bill is very clear. It provides that it is the policy of the United States, upon enactment of this law, to deploy a national missile defense system as soon as technologically possible. That is unequivocal. It does not say ``but if.'' It is a change in policy of our Government. It has passed both Houses by a large majority, and now the President has signed the statute. 
   It seems to me the President is trying to reinterpret the bill to justify changing his position on this issue. He signed the bill; he didn't veto it. This is not a veto message. He could have vetoed the bill, if he disagreed with the terms, and given Congress an opportunity to review that veto message and override the veto or sustain it, as the Congress' will dictates. 
   I point this out to suggest that it is clear we have changed our policy, irrespective of the President's qualms about the new policy, and we now are committed as a nation to deploy a national missile defense system. We will do so in the orderly course of authorization and appropriation bills that we pass, as required. We have an annual appropriations bill funding all of the activities of the Department of Defense. But it is clear that one of those activities will be the continued research, development, and deployment of a national missile defense system. 
   I think it is very timely to point this out because the Prime Minister of Russia is coming to the United States. There will be talks this week with the President. 
   I am hopeful, and I urge the President to be honest with the Russian leadership about the need to modify the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty because the first part of that treaty says that neither signatory will deploy a missile defense system to protect the territory of its nation. But we have just changed the law of the United States to say that is our intention. We are committed to deploying a missile defense system that will protect the territory of the United States. 
   So, insofar as that is inconsistent with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the treaty needs to be changed, and our President should say that to the Prime Minister of Russia unequivocally--not we ``may'' change our mind when it comes time to authorize a deployment or to fund a deployment. 
   The decision has been made to deploy a system, and when technology permits us to deploy an effective missile defense system under the terms of this act, we are going to do it irrespective of the provisions of that treaty. So we must change the treaty. And we want to assure the Russians that we are not targeting them. We are not trying to create a new era of tension or competition or to make this a more dangerous relationship--just the opposite; we want to be aboveboard, candid, and honest with the Russians. 
   That is what I hope the President will do as a spokesman for our country.

   Mr. COCHRAN. I agree with Senator WARNER that this is an issue that must be addressed. In prior action, the Congress provided the authority for federal departments and agencies to contribute one-half of the costs of obtaining professional liability insurance for federal managers and law enforcement officials. Unfortunately, this benefit has not been offered by all federal departments. I am committed to working with Senator WARNER to address this issue and to ensure that all federal managers and law enforcement officials are treated fairly.

    Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a Senate Resolution to designate March, 2000 as Arts Education Month. This legislation complements S. 1293, the Congressional Recognition for Excellence in Arts Education Act, which I introduced earlier this week. 
   Instruction in music, visual arts, theater and dance occurs in schools across the nation. There is growing awareness of arts education as a serious academic subject with a list of benefits that include ensuring America's arts traditions, higher I.Q.'s, better SAT scores, better math and language skills, less juvenile delinquency, better chances of  higher education, and increased job opportunities. 
   The National Assessment of Education Progress, The College Board, The U.S. Department of Justice, The National Endowment for the Arts, and scientific research on the brain have all recently reported evidence of the multiple advantages of arts instruction. For example, the July 5, 1999 issue of Time magazine has a report titled, ``Fingers, Brains and Mozart'' which highlights recent brain research and the positive effects of music instruction. 
   It is time for the United States Senate to recognize the achievements and efforts in arts education in all schools. I hope that by designating March, 2000 as Arts Education Month, more schools will engage in activities that showcase celebrate, reward and provide new arts experiences. 
   I invite all of my colleagues to join me in sponsoring Arts Education Month.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on May 6, 1999, I was pleased to join my friend, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, (Mr. DOMENICI), in introducing a Senate Resolution designating the third week in October, 1999 and 2000 as Character Counts Week. I am delighted today that we are approving this legislation, just as we have approved similar legislation in the Senate every year since 1994. 
   In 1993, the Josephson Institute of Ethics convened a conference of ethicists, educators and other leaders to examine the issue of character development. The result of that conference, held in Aspen Colorado, was the Aspen Declaration on Character Education. 
   The elements of character described in the Aspen Declaration were: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. They are often referred to now as the Six Pillars of Character. 
   Today, more than 300 member organizations, including community groups, schools and businesses are part of a nationwide Character Counts Coalition. These organizations sponsor programs that emphasize the importance of good character traits in our society. American society is dependent on the strength of the character of her citizens. 
   Never have we seen a time in the life of our society that good character has been more important. Solid lessons in character must be taught by parents and families, schools, and religious groups. 
   A 1996 National School Boards Association report on Character Education  in our schools showed a significant trend toward adopting character education programs in schools. 
   Character Counts! suggests three steps to teach young people for making the decision to do the right thing:  
   1. Think about the welfare of all people likely to be affected by your actions and make choices that avoid harm to and promote the well-being of others. 
   2. Demonstrate character by living up to all ethical principles of the Six Pillars of Character even when you must give up other things you want. 
   3. If you cannot live up to one ethical principle without giving up another, do the thing that you sincerely believe will promote a better society and should be done by all.  
   The National School Boards Association report found that schools with character education programs reported improvement in student leadership, discipline, violence, vandalism, academic performance, attendance and drug and alcohol incidents. It also stated, ``Ultimately, ..... character education may be a long-term investment as improvement and contribution levels often increase over time.'' 
   As we work to train our children well, we must keep in mind that we are building the foundation for new generations. The examples we set about how we treat others, and what we accept in social behavior will influence not only our children, but all children. 
   In Mississippi, the Noxubee County Competitive Community Program, the Ocean Springs Chamber of Commerce, Kids With Character, and the Junior Auxiliary of Clinton are organizations who have joined the Character Counts! Coalition. They make specific commitments including:  
   To integrate character education into new and existing programs and to encourage young people and their parents to adopt and model the Six Pillars. And, to participate in CHARACTER COUNTS! Week.  
   I congratulate them on their important efforts and hope that this year more groups and communities will become involved in similar programs.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Congressional Recognition for Excellence in Arts Education Act. The act establishes awards for schools that include the arts in their regular curriculum. 
   When Congress passed the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994, we found ``that the arts are forms of understanding and ways of knowing that are fundamentally important to education.'' Since then, many professional studies have been published about the relationship of arts education to brain development, student achievement, career potential and other life quality issues. 
   The 1997 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Arts Report Card was the first ever assessment of the effects of specific arts instruction and the level of fine arts skills in American students. The assessment found that music and visual arts were more likely to be taught than theater or dance, but the percentages of students actually in classes and their achievement varied widely. The report card showed that instruction improved competency and literacy; and without it, very few students were able to create or perform at an advanced or adequate level. This report card makes clear that attaining knowledge and skill in the arts is no different from becoming proficient in any school subject. While a few students are gifted, most have to be taught in order to discover and use our abilities. And gifted students also need training and learning opportunities. 
   The evidence of the positive effects of arts education on overall scholastic achievement is an incentive for students, parents and schools to support serious sequential course work. In 1997, The College Board reported that high school students with four or more years of arts instruction scored over 100 points higher on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than students with no arts instruction. And according to the medical publication, Neurological Research, a California study determined that young children with six months of keyboard instruction performed 34% higher on tests measuring temporal-spatial ability than other children. 
   Arts activity has been shown to lower the likelihood of delinquent behavior. In 1996, the Department of Justice and the National Endowment for the Arts began a project called YouthARTS, which developed model after-school arts programs for teenagers. The evaluation of programs in Fulton County, Georgia; Portland, Oregon; and San Antonio, Texas found that YouthARTS participants significantly decreased their delinquent behavior, increased their communication skills, and improved their ability to complete tasks. The National Dropout Prevention Center reported that school arts classes and activities encourage attendance and achievement of at-risk high school students. 
   Programs teaching arts in schools differ widely from state to state, and from district to district within a state. The effectiveness of the programs also varies. The Arts Education Partnership is a private, nonprofit coalition of education, arts, business, philanthropic, and government organizations that demonstrates and promotes the essential role of arts education in enabling all students to succeed in school, life, and work. It was formed in 1995 through a cooperative agreement between the National Endowment for the Arts, the United States Education Department, the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, and the Council of Chief State School Officers. 
   Mr. President, earlier this year, the Arts Education Partnership, with the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, released a report titled, Gaining the Arts Advantage: Lessons From School Districts that Value Arts Education. It is a national study of arts education in schools. Thirteen ``critical success factors'' of district-wide arts education programs were identified. The introduction to the report summarizes the findings this way, ``the presence and quality of arts education in public schools today require an exceptional degree of involvement by influential segments of the 
   community which value the arts in the total affairs of the school district: in governance, funding, and program delivery.'' 
   The report profiles 91 American school districts with successful arts curriculum programs. I was very pleased to find the Hattiesburg and Starkville, Mississippi school districts featured in the report. 
   Outside funding and the success of classes in music, drama, dance and visual arts has turned the arts into a priority in the Hattiesburg Public School District budget. Hattiesburg superintendent Dr. Gordon Walker views arts as a school responsibility to ensure that, ``all students' lives are enriched and enhanced through academic achievement in the arts.'' 
   Starkville's K-12 arts programs include: theater, visual arts, music labs, television and graphic arts. Other features in their arts education plan are a design program that brings university architecture students to an elementary school and an after school program funded by a U.S. Department of Education grant. Joyce Polk, Starkville School District arts coordinator explained that a comprehensive arts education, ``..... improves academic achievement and results in the development of well-rounded students who are able to leave rural Mississippi and compete in prestigious college and university environments.'' She also attributes arts opportunities in the schools with a higher quality of life for all community members, an understanding between diverse ethnic and cultural groups, a common bond among students, and long term healthy lifestyles. I am proud of these school districts and the example they set for other American school districts. 
   An example of innovative efforts to support excellence and commitment in arts instruction is the Mississippi Arts Commission's Whole Schools Institute,  which began this year. The institute at Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi, is a week of professional development in teaching, planning and implementing new curriculum. School teams of over 150 superintendents, principals, teachers, community and business leaders had one-on-one training with nationally renowned arts educators, child and brain development researchers and arts professionals. 
   By recognizing the importance of arts instruction, I hope that we make arts classes in schools as common as English or math. My bill establishes the Congressional Recognition for Excellence in Arts Education (CREATE) Awards and a board to direct the activities needed to promote it, to encourage arts curriculum, and to determine eligible schools. 
   Mr. President, vision and excellence can't be mandated, but through legislation, such as the Congressional Recognition for Excellence in Arts Education Act, we can reward it.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, imposing quotas on the importation of foreign steel to protect some U.S. steel producers will have several negative effects on the domestic and world economy. 
   The best way to combat illegal trade practices is to adopt trade laws that are compatible with World Trade Organization rules. We already have in place section 201, dealing with temporary import surges and section 301, regarding anti-dumping. They have both proven effective in recent months in altering the steel trade balance. 
   Steel imports are already subject to over 100 outstanding antidumping and countervailing duty orders. Congress should not judge the outcome of these investigations by imposing quotas on top of existing trade rules. Maintaining consistency in our trade policy is of utmost importance, given that the U.S. is the world's largest trading country. Furthermore, The United States will host the WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle later this year. The success of these ongoing international trade talks depends on our credibility and compliance with those rules. 
   We must recognize that imposing on steel imports may affect other important U.S. industries as well. In Mississippi there are wire producers, shipbuilders and manufacturers who provide thousands of jobs and whose products contribute to our strong U.S. economy. And, when retaliations occur as a result of our implementation of quotas, they will undoubtedly affect other sectors of our economy, including agriculture. 
   In Mississippi alone agriculture exports of cotton, soybeans, poultry, rice and meat account for $850 million and 13,900 jobs according to the USDA and Census Bureau. The American Farm Bureau reports that exports constitute more than one-third of all U.S. agricultural sales. More than 1 million Americans today have jobs dependent on U.S.  agricultural exports, including farming, food processing and transportation. 
   The Coalition to Promote U.S. Agricultural Exports reports that every one billion dollars in exports helps create as many as 17,000 new jobs. In light of the market crises abroad in Asia, Russia, and the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union, it is more important than ever to assist the agricultural community by maintaining its access to the world's markets. This is the key to economic recovery of the farm sector. 
   U.S. agricultural and manufacturing exports totaled more than $680 billion last year. If Congress imposes quotas inconsistent with WTO rules, all U.S. industries may be targets for retaliation, putting at risk the revenues and jobs these industries and their exports produce. It is these very WTO agreements which enable our trading partners to retaliate against our exports. 
   This legislation's protection for the specialized steel industry will lead to protectionism. For the good of all U.S. industries--as well as agriculture--open markets, free, and fair trade, and a rules-based international trading system ought to be the principles on which we base our trade laws.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to present for the Senate's consideration, S. 1233, the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. This bill provides fiscal year 2000 funding for all programs and activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Forest Service is not included. It is funded in the Interior appropriations bill. 
   As reported, the bill recommends total new budget authority for fiscal year 2000 of $60.7 billion. This is $6.2 billion more than the fiscal year 1999 enacted level and $1.2 billion less than the President's fiscal year 2000 budget request. 
   Changes in mandatory funding requirements account for the overall increase from the fiscal year 1999 enacted level primarily due to a $5.9 billion estimated increase in the required payment to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for net realized losses. In fact, I point out that just over three-quarters of the total $60.7 billion recommended by this bill is for mandatory appropriations, over which the Appropriations Committee has no effective control. 
   The spending levels for these programs are governed by authorizing statutes. The mandatory programs funded by the bill include not only the payment to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for net realized losses which I just mentioned, but the food stamp and child nutrition programs, and the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation. Less than one-fourth of the total funding recommended by this bill is for discretionary programs and activities. 
   Including congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior year spending actions, this bill recommends total discretionary spending of $13.983 billion in budget authority and $14.254 billion in outlays for fiscal year 2000. These amounts are consistent with the subcommittee's discretionary spending allocations. 
   I will take a few minutes to summarize the bill's major funding recommendations. For the Food Safety and Inspection Service, appropriations of $638 million are recommended, $21 million more than the fiscal year 1999 level. For the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, $445 million is recommended, $11 million more than the 1999 level. Appropriations of USDA headquarters operations and for other agriculture marketing and regulatory programs are approximately the same as the 1999 appropriations levels, with the exception of a $7 million increase in the mandatory USDA rental payment to the General Services Administration, a $7 million reduction in funding for the census of agriculture, and increased funding for programs and activities included in the President's food safety initiative. 
   For farm credit programs, the bill funds an estimated $3.1 billion total loan program level, $798 million more than the fiscal year 1999 level, excluding additional loans funded through fiscal 1999 emergency appropriations. The amount recommended includes $559 million for farm ownership loans and $2.4 billion for farm operating loans. 
   Total appropriations of $795 million are recommended for salaries and expenses of the Farm Service Agency. This is $80 million more than the 1999 level and the same as the President's budget request. 
   For agriculture research, education, and extension activities, the bill provides total appropriations of $1.8 billion. Included in this amount is a reduction from fiscal year 1999 of $3.4 million for Agricultural Research Service, ARS, buildings and facilities, a $24 million increase for research activities of the ARS; and a $12 million increase in total funding for the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service. 
   For USDA conservation programs, total funding of $807 million is provided, $15 million more than the 1999 level. This includes $656 million for conservation operations, $99 million for watershed and flood prevention operations, and $35 million for the resource conservation and development program. 
   USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service is funded at a level of $140 million. In addition, a total program level of $946 million is recommended for the Public Law 480 program, including $159 million for Title I and $787 million for Title II of the program. These amounts, together with projected carryover balances, will, at minimum, be sufficient to maintain the fiscal year 1999 funded P.L. 480 Titles I and II levels of $220 million and $837 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2000. 
   The bill also provides a total program level of $2.2 billion for rural economic and community development programs. Included in this amount is $718 million for the Rural Community Advancement Program, $55 million for the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and a total of $1.6 billion program level for rural electric and telecommunications loans. 
   In addition, the bill devotes additional resources to those programs which provide affordable, safe, and decent housing for low-income individuals and families living in rural America. 
   Estimated rural housing loan authorizations funded by this bill total $4.6 billion, a $343 million increase from the fiscal year 1999 level. Included in this amount is $4.3 billion in section 502 low-income housing direct and guaranteed loans and $114 million in section 515 rental housing loans. 
   In addition, $640 million is included for rental assistance program. This is the $200 million more than the budget request and $57 million more than the 1999 appropriations level. 
   Over 58 percent of the bill's total funding, $36 billion, is provided for USDA's domestic food assistance programs. This includes $9.6 billion for child nutrition programs, including $13 million for the newly-authorized school breakfast pilot projects and evaluation; $4 billion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, WIC; $131 million for the commodity assistance program; and $21.6 billion for the food stamp program. The bill also provides first-time funding of $3 billion for Bill Emerson and Mickey Leland Hunger Fellowships through the Congressional Hunger Center. 
   For those independent agencies funded by the bill, the Committee provides total appropriations of $1.1 billion. Included in this amount is $61 million for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and $1 billion for the Food and Drug Administration, FDA. 
   Total appropriations recommended for salaries and expenses of the FDA are $65 million more than the 1999 level, and reflect the full increase requested in the budget for FDA rental payments to the General Services Administration, an additional $25 million for FDA food safety initiatives, and an increase of $28 million for premarket application review. 
   In addition, the bill makes available $145 million in Prescription Drug User Fee Act collections, $13 million more than the fiscal year 1999 level. 
   The increase provided for premarket application review is the full amount requested by the President for these activities through a combination of direct appropriations and collections from proposed new user fees. By FDA's own admission, new blood products, animal and generic drugs, medical devices, and food additives all suffer from lengthy review time, far short of meeting the statutory performance requirements. This increase is essential to enable FDA to perform its core statutory mission of reviewing drugs, foods, medical devices and products within statutory time frames and to ensure patients' speedy access to new products and the latest technology. 
   I point out to my colleagues that the discretionary budget authority allocation for this bill is nearly the same as the CBO baseline level, or a ``freeze'' at the 1999 enacted appropriations level. To provide the selected increases I just cited and to maintain funding for essential farm, housing, and rural development programs, several mandatory funding restrictions are included in the bill. Modest limitations are imposed on Food Stamp program commodity purchases, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, and on new acreage enrollments in the Wetlands Reserve Program. Funding for the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems is limited to $50 million, and restrictions are imposed on fiscal year 2000  funding for the Conservation Farm Option Program and the Fund for Rural America. 
   I also point out to my colleagues that although the total discretionary spending recommended by this bill is approximately $190 million in budget authority below the President's request level, the President's proposed budget relies on additional revenues and savings to accommodate much higher levels of discretionary spending. The President's budget proposes to generate a net total of $532 million in collections from new user fees proposals; to make an additional $180 million available by double-counting savings used to offset 1999 appropriations; to shift the Foreign Market Development Cooperator program from the discretionary to the mandatory side of the ledger, saving $28 million; to defer until fiscal year 2001 a portion of the funds needed to meet rental assistance requirements, saving $200 million; and to redirect funds from ongoing projects and Congressional initiatives to pay for Presidential initiatives. 
   We do not propose savings from scorekeeping tactics, or have the luxury of being able to rely on revenues and savings from legislative proposals that have not been acted on by the Congress or signed into law. Consequently, within the discretionary spending limitations established for this bill, we have not been able to afford many of the discretionary spending increases and new initiatives proposed by the administration. 
   I am going to highlight what I think to be some of the important provisions of this bill and discuss how the subcommittee reached its decisions as to the priorities we felt were important enough to include for increases in spending and how we generally approached developing this legislation. 
   As the occupant of the Chair may well remember, we decided this year to conduct our hearings based on subject matter categories. We defined food safety as one of the highest priority interests in the country today, and one of the most challenging issues. 
   After hearing the Secretary of Agriculture present the overall budget request for the Department of Agriculture this year, we then began concentrating on the issue areas we thought to be considered high priority areas of interest. Food safety was the first one we considered, with witnesses being the highest ranking officials in the administration with responsibilities over those areas of the President's budget. Testifying were the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, for example; the Director of the Food Safety and Inspection Service and the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta was represented at this hearing as well. Based on our findings and the information we were able to obtain, this committee has recommended increases for funding of programs and activities that come under this general issue area. 
   We also want to point out that it was clear to us, because of the programs and activities and hard work in the past, we are able to enjoy the safest food supply in the world, the most abundant food supply, the most affordable food supply. The fact of the matter is, Americans ought to feel very confident and comfortable with the inspection programs, with the recent initiatives that have been developed to make them better, more effective, and the funding levels that are contained in this legislation to help assure that we continue to improve upon the record of the past. 
   There have been problems, and we are frightened when we hear about contaminated food products. We think more needs to be done in terms of educating the public in the handling of food and in the preparation of foodstuffs. 
   At the same time, there are some responsibilities that peculiarly belong in the hands of the Federal Government. Our challenge is to make sure those programs are being administered in the way they should be, in the way Congress provided the authority for them to be administered, and that they are using the funds effectively. 
   I believe we can be confident in the expression of support we have for the food safety initiative. We have added funds for that and in other ways we think we have strengthened the activities of the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and others as they relate to food safety. 
   I am also happy to report that we were able to recommend funding for important nutrition programs. People may not realize it, but almost 60 percent of the funding in this bill is allocated to food and nutrition programs. Of the total amount of $60.7 billion, almost 60 percent of it will be spent in the year 2000 to help provide food that is needed by those who cannot afford to adequately meet their own needs and the needs of their families, and for other programs, like the School Lunch Program which we know is tied directly to child health and learning and school performance. 
   There are other programs, as well, for those who are out of work and disabled. The Food Stamp Program is one of the best known and also is funded at a high level, although the trend has been going down. That is an indication of the strength of the economy and the fact that when we do have a good economic growth program and jobs are being provided, less money is needed for the Food Stamp Program. That is one reason we were able to hold down the increase in the mandatory programs, because there is a reduction 
   of about $1 billion in the expected cost of the Food Stamp Program for next year as compared to last year. That is good news. 
   We are increasing the funds for the WIC Program, the Special Supplemental Feeding Program for Women, Infants, and Children. This is the special program that deals with those women who are pregnant, and young children who need special assistance. We are increasing the funds so that those needs will be met as a result of the spending in this bill. 
   There was a pilot program authorized last year by the agriculture committees that have legislative jurisdiction over these programs for a school breakfast program. This will be a demonstration program that would provide free breakfasts to all children in a school to find out what effect that would have, whether the need is there, whether the demand is there. We provided funds to start up and evaluate a pilot breakfast program in this legislation. 
   We have added funds for a fellowship program for the Congressional Hunger Center. These fellowships will be named for Bill Emerson, a former Congressman from Missouri, and Mickey Leland, former Congressman from Texas, both of whom have been instrumental in their careers when they served in the Congress on hunger issues and in dealing with problems of those who do not have enough to eat. 
   We are hopeful the entire nutrition area will meet with favor in the Senate because of the way we analyzed and went about trying to identify the priority needs, looking at the available funding and trying to match those in a reasonable and thoughtful way in the bill, and I think we have done that. 
   Research is an area a lot of people do not think about too much unless they are involved in it or benefit directly from it. But it is a part of this Department's activities where we have recommended additional spending, additional spending compared with last year and, in many cases, additional spending as compared with the President's budget request. 
   We think these are wise investments in making sure we identify the emerging technologies that can benefit production agriculture, farmers who are out there trying to deal with the big problem of prospective low income because of low commodity prices. 
   One way you can make that up or help deal with that challenge is to improve yields of crops, to develop ways to operate a farm more efficiently, to cut down the costs of the so-called inputs into production agriculture, the costs of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizer, and other variable costs of production. 
   One way to get at this is develop new techniques. Biotechnology is one example. Seed genetics is another. Private industry is contributing an enormous amount of research and development in these areas, but the Federal Government has a role to play, too. 
   In many cases, what the Federal Government starts in the way of research in some of these areas is carried on by others in the private sector. Colleges and universities have laboratories and students and scientists involved in many of these research projects. So  across the country, we see very important work being done in agriculture-related research that will help farmers achieve profits in agriculture in the future and help make our food supply safer, help make production agriculture more compatible with the environment through more effective pesticides, and other inputs in production agriculture that are very costly to the farmer but also contain some inherent environmental risk as well and have to be closely monitored. 
   So I think agriculture research, particularly ARS research activities, as they are increased in this bill, are justified because of the end results that we think will flow from these activities. 
   Another area that we emphasized in this legislation is conservation, not just protecting our land and water resources from erosion or contamination but also using incentives in this legislation to encourage farmers to manage their lands, to enhance wildlife habitat, and to be more sensitive to the needs of those who enjoy the outdoors for hiking along the beautiful rivers and streams we have in our country. All of these are very important national assets. 
   So this legislation funds programs that are designed to achieve the goal of protecting our environment, protecting our land from erosion, protecting our water from contamination. 
   One example of a fairly new program that farmers are beginning to appreciate more and more is the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program. Funds are made available directly through the Commodity Credit Corporation to encourage farmers who participate in and who want to be involved in this program with new techniques in ways of improving wildlife habitat on their land, devoting certain acreage to wildlife plantings or conservation techniques. We are finding that is a very important new program. 
   We are also providing more funds for wetlands conservation program activity than ever before in this bill. The Conservation Reserve Program is another important program. It has led to a lot of tree planting, a lot of conservation practices, idling acres that had been in production agriculture that probably should not have been in production agriculture from the beginning and defined by those at the Department of Agriculture, who have responsibilities for soil conservation programs, as erodible, highly erodible lands. So we have provided the continuation of funding for that program as well. 
   So this is an effort to establish priorities and to see that within the limitations that we have for discretionary spending, that we target the funds where we think they are very definitely needed. We think this is one of those areas. 
   Let me just say something about farm income support. We had an entire hearing looking at the prospects for farm income. The chief economist at the Department was there. Other high-ranking officials of the Department of Agriculture came and testified as well. We learned what a lot of people already know who watch this situation very closely; that farm income is going to be down, net farm income, by over $3 billion in this next crop year, which has already begun. 
   You compare that with last year's level of income which was substantially lower than the year before, that triggered a $6 billion disaster assistance program, and you understand how serious the income situation is for those involved in farming in America today. 
   We talked about what could be done, what programs are in place that we could fund or continue or improve that would improve the likelihood that farmers could achieve a better result than projected. 
   Some things came to mind: Doing a better job in the promotion of American agriculture products overseas, trying to make sure that our trade relations are good, getting the Government more actively involved in taking up for farmers in the sale of what they produced in overseas markets. 
   If they are denied access to a market or if American commodities are being discriminated against in some way, the Government has an obligation to get actively involved and not just say: farmers, sorry; exporters, sorry. You are on your own. This is a business country, and free enterprise means that you have to get out there and do this on your own. 
   We do not agree with that hands-off attitude in this 
   committee. We are funding programs that will help ensure that farmers get a better chance of selling what they produce in overseas markets. 
   Breaking down barriers to trade, sometimes Congress does itself in on this issue. I hear that we are considering taking up a bill to put imports on steel. Somebody may say: Who cares? What does that have to do with farming? If you do something like that, immediately you reap the whirlwind, because those that you put a quota on, who are trying to sell you something, put a quota on you. And what do we sell most of? We have a surplus of trade in agriculture commodities. 
   We have a deficit in trade on most other things. We have an overall trade deficit. Agriculture is one of the few sectors of our economy with a positive trade balance. But we are going to undo that if we are not careful as we take on some of these issues that may sound good for the moment or please some organized labor union. We are going to find out that is not very smart. I hope the Senate will be careful as it approaches issues like that. 
   But one thing we are doing, legislation reported by the Agriculture Committee, which I hope the Senate will pass, which does something about rationalizing the attitudes of how to use sanctions and imposing sanctions on trade when we are mad at some country because they do not behave in a way that we think they ought to. 
   In the past, we have seen administrations--including this one; others, too--impose sanctions to try to punish that country. What happens is we end up punishing our farmers because we cannot export our agriculture commodities. 
   We are exempting, as the Senate has recently acted on, food in trade relations. We know that food should not be used as a weapon. We are learning that. There are a few clear examples where we are going to continue to do it, I suppose--Cuba, some other countries that are in that category--but generally speaking, we are changing the policy so that farmers will not have to pay the price and bear the brunt of American foreign policy by giving up trading opportunities and the opportunity to export and sell farm commodities in the international market. But nonetheless, there are going to be problems, even though we are trying to do the right thing on trade sanctions reform, on fair and reciprocal trade relations. 
   Tax reform is another jurisdictional committee responsibility, but we are seeing progress being made there. Interest rates are a big factor because that is a major input into the costs of production agriculture in some areas of the country, particularly in the South. We are hopeful that the interest rates can remain low and will not be increased. That can be a very serious detriment to the effort to try to improve farm income. 
   There are some in our committee who wanted to attach to this bill a $6.5 billion amendment for disaster assistance. It was offered in our committee, but I made a motion to table the amendment. That motion carried. Then in the full committee, while it was mentioned as a possibility for debate in the full committee, it was not offered in the full committee. But we have been told there will be an amendment offered to add $6.5 billion or thereabouts to this bill for disaster assistance for farmers. 
   I do not think there is any question that farmers are in trouble this year because of low commodity prices, and other factors, some of which I have mentioned. We do not know what the weather situation is going to be. This is the beginning of the crop year. 
   To try to anticipate right now what the situation is going to be at harvest time and at the time when most farmers may be selling their crops, we know that it is likely that income is going to be down. So what we hope we will see is an administration that remains very much involved in monitoring the situation that confronts production agriculture and submit to the Congress a request for additional funding for disaster assistance as may be needed based on the circumstances. 
   Senators will remember that this month the Department of Agriculture is just now getting around to sending to a lot of  farmers benefit checks that were approved last October in the disaster bill which was passed by Congress in the total amount of about $6 billion. Some $2.4 billion of that amount was for weather-related disasters, multiyear disasters. 
   Arguably, the administration had a difficult time determining eligibility, settling on the regulations to implement the program. It was a big job; there is no question about that. But it took a long time. 
   We responded, when we were requested to provide additional funding for staffing to process the applications from farmers who wanted to apply for benefits under that program. We provided in the initial bill about $40 million for that purpose for additional funds for the Farm Service Agency offices. Then later this year we were asked to provide more. We responded and provided more. As a matter of fact, in the supplemental that was passed in May, there was about $575 million of additional funding approved for the Department of Agriculture, a good bit of which was related to the continuing disaster program and the administration of that program that was identified last year by Congress and the administration. 
   One thing that stands out in my memory about this disaster assistance issue is that this bill last year, when we were on the floor presenting it to the Senate, had included an issue relating to disaster assistance. What the Senate did was try to listen to other Senators. We were here on the floor discussing alternatives for responding to the disaster. We ended up, in the course of handling this bill, developing a disaster assistance program of $4 billion for America's farmers for emergency disaster assistance. Guess what happened. The President vetoed the bill. 
   I am going to read you what the President said in his veto message to the Congress after vetoing the agriculture appropriations bill last year:  
   I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 4101, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999. I am vetoing this bill because it fails to address adequately the crisis now gripping our Nation's farm community.  
   Then, after four paragraphs or so, the President says this:  
   I am extremely disappointed that the Congress has reacted to this agriculture emergency situation by sending me a bill that fails to provide an adequate safety net for our farmers. I have repeatedly stated that I would veto any emergency farm assistance bill if it did not adequately address our farmers' immediate needs, and this bill does not do enough.  
   Then at the end of the message:  
   Therefore, as I return this bill, I again call on the Congress to send me a comprehensive plan before this session ends that adequately responds to the very real needs of our farmers at this difficult time. William J. Clinton, the White House, October 7, 1998.  
   That wasn't very long ago. Well, what happened next was, we reconsidered the agriculture appropriations bill in the Congress. The House and Senate conferees got back together with representatives of the administration. This was a bipartisan effort to try to reach some agreement as to what would be an adequate amount of disaster assistance. We had tried to get the administration involved early in the process, and we didn't have any luck. There was no active involvement in providing information, any guidance as to what the President's views were. There were differences of opinion all over Capitol Hill as to what should be done. Then we passed a $6 billion disaster assistance package in the Omnibus Appropriations Act at the end of last year's Congress. That was signed by the President. 
   Now we are just getting all of those benefits delivered to the farmers. This is June, and it was June when the last checks were 
   supposed to be going out from that October disaster assistance bill last year. 
   What I have suggested we do, rather than doing what we did last year, which provoked a veto--Congress acted first. We went forward and tried to develop a sensitive and, we thought, thoughtful response. The President gave us the back of his hand, in my view, with an effort to win political points with a distressed agriculture community, and said: Congress was not generous enough, but I will be more generous. I will insist that they spend more. 
   Well, we are not going to fall for that again. I am not going to recommend to this Senate that we pick a number and try to satisfy the President and guess at what the weather situation is going to be throughout the country, what the yields are going to be in all the different commodities, who is going to have the big problems, the serious problems, and who may be able to weather it without disaster assistance this year. 
   I have been joined in an effort by 21 other Senators. This letter was sent to the President on June 15, which is the day we proceeded with the markup on this bill. I will read it into the RECORD:

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am genuinely flattered by the kind and generous comments of my distinguished colleague from Kansas, Senator ROBERTS. As others know, he served with distinction as chairman of the Agriculture Committee in the other body. He led the passage of farm legislation in that body, and he has been a very effective spokesman for the farmers and ranchers of the entire country, not just of his home State of Kansas. We benefit from his advice and counsel. I appreciate his personal friendship as well and taking time to talk about this legislation and point out what we are trying to accomplish by funding the programs in this bill. I appreciate his remarks very much.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to provide relief to many Federal employees and their families who, through no fault of their own, find themselves the victims of retirement coverage errors. 
   In 1984, the Federal government made a transition from the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) to the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). As government agencies carried out the complex job of applying two sets of transition rules, mistakes were made, and thousands of employees were placed in the wrong retirement system--many learning that their pensions would be less than expected. Under the current statutory scheme, federal agencies have no choice but to correct a retirement coverage error when it is discovered, effectively forcing employees into a new retirement plan. Unfortunately, the correction of a retirement coverage error can have a harmful impact on an employee's financial ability to plan for retirement. 
   This proposal, ``The Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act,'' provides comprehensive and equitable relief to employees, former employees, retirees, and survivors who are affected by retirement coverage errors. The bill provides individuals with a choice between corrected retirement coverage and the coverage the employee expected to receive, without disturbing Social Security coverage law. For each type of retirement coverage error, individuals are furnished the opportunity to maintain their expected level of retirement benefits without a change in their retirement savings and planning. Among other provisions, the bill also provides that certain employees who missed an opportunity to contribute to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) due to a coverage error may receive interest on their TSP make-up contributions. 
   ``The Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act'' provides a comprehensive solution to the problems faced by Federal employees due to retirement coverage erros--it does so at a reasonable cost and without creating unnecessary administrative burdens. 
   I invite my colleagues to support this effort to address a serious problem affecting Federal employees and their families.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on July 1, my friend, Donald Meiners, will retire from Entergy-Mississippi after 39 years of service. Mr. Meiners began his career in 1960 as a residential salesman in Jackson for what was then Mississippi Power & Light Company. He was quickly promoted in the marketing and operations divisions which involved numerous moves across the state of Mississippi. He became an officer in 1978. After several promotions with Middle South Utilities, the parent company of MP&L, which now is Entergy Corporation, Don returned to his home state of Mississippi as president and chief operating officer of Entergy-MS. Then, he became president and chief executive officer. 
   While Mr. Meiners is well respected in the corporate world, many Mississippians know him for his dedication and service to charities and civic organizations within his community and state. He has served as Chairman of the Metro-Jackson Chamber of Commerce, Jackson United Way and the Multiple Sclerosis Chapter of Mississippi. 
   While Chairman of the Metro-Jackson Chamber of Commerce, Don was instrumental in forming the Metro Economic Development Alliance which unites economic development professionals in the Jackson area and encourages a team effort in recruiting new industry to the area. He served as the first chairman of the Metro Jackson Housing Partnership. Don has also been a leader of national organizations as well. He serves as a National Trustee of Boys and Girls Clubs of America and just last year served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Business and Industry Political Action Committee in Washington, DC. 
   Duane O'Neill, who is President of the Metro-Jackson Chamber of Commerce, said, ``Don Meiners personifies a visionary leader, and he possesses the technical skills to translate that vision into action. His unquestioned integrity has always brought people together in an atmosphere of cooperation.'' 
   I am personally grateful for Don's work and involvement to help improve the state's economy. As an example of his outstanding community service, in 1996, Don Meiners was recognized as the outstanding volunteer of the year in economic development for the state of Mississippi. 
   Don has been married for 42 years to his high school sweetheart, Pat, who has been a tremendous asset to him and to the communities where they have lived. They have two sons, Chris and Chuck, and a daughter-in-law Pam. When I asked Don what he would do in retirement he quickly mentioned spending time with the ``light of his life'', his granddaughters Hannah and Mallory. 
   Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to bring to the attention of the Senate the career and influence of my friend Don Meiners, and to thank him for his many years of service to Entergy and the people of Mississippi. Mississippi is a better place because of him. While Don is retiring from the utility business, I know he will go on working to help make life better in his community and in our state. 
   I wish Don and Pat much continued success and happiness in the years ahead.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, this amendment would authorize the transfer of a naval vessel to Thailand and would authorize the Secretary of the Navy to receive in exchange a ship that is now in the fleet of Thailand. The purpose of the amendment is to provide authority to the Secretary of the Navy to give a retiring U.S. Navy Cyclone class ship to the Government of Thailand in exchange for a former U.S. Navy ship which served in World War II in the Pacific. That ship is the LCS 102, LCS stands for landing craft support. It is presently in the service of the Royal Navy of Thailand. 
   For some history on this subject, 3 years ago in Public Law 104-201, the Congress went on record in favor of trying to bring back to the United States the LCS 102. It is the last surviving ship of its class. This ship saw heavy combat action in the western Pacific during World War II. It was transferred after the war to Japan and then later was transferred to Thailand where she has been in service for 30 years. This ship is of great historical significance. It is the last one of its kind in existence in the world. Just a few years ago, it was entered on the Register of the World Ship Trust. 
   Many sailors from World War II might not recognize this class of ship, because it was one of many different types of amphibious ships used in the Pacific during World War II. But it was highly appreciated by the Navy admirals and the Marines because it was a heavily armed gunboat which gave close-in fire support to the Marines in amphibious landings. In fact, the LCS ships had more firepower per ton than an Iowa class battleship. 
   These ships were in the thick of it in Iwo Jima, Okinawa, the Philippines, and New Guinea. They also served in an anti-aircraft role against kamikaze aircraft at Okinawa and Iwo Jima, because of their tremendous firepower. 
   Mr. President, 26 of the 130 LCSs that were built were sunk, or badly damaged in the first 6 months of their duty in the Pacific. Historians have begun to write about these ships and the role they played in the successful war in the Pacific. There is one illustrative title, ``Mighty Midgets At War: The Saga of the LCS(L) Ships from Iwo Jima to Vietnam,'' by Robert L. Reilly. 
   Our distinguished former colleague, who was chairman of the Armed Services Committee, John Tower of Texas, served aboard the LCS 112. He was chief bosun's mate during World War II on that ship. Also, former Secretary of the Navy William Middendorf served as an officer abroad LCS 53 and former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman's father served as commanding officer of LCS 18 in the Pacific. He received the Bronze Star for bravery during his service at Okinawa. 
   In addition, the commanding officer of LCS 122, then lieutenant, Richard M. McCool, who now resides in Bainbridge Island in the State of Washington, received the Congressional Medal of Honor from President Truman for his service during a kamikaze attack at Okinawa. 
   There are several former LCS sailors from my State who have written me in support of this transfer: Robert Wells of Ocean Springs, MS, recently wrote me a letter saying he was the only medical officer abroad LCS 31. Here is what else he said in his letter:  
   ......The LCS-31, along with approximately 20 other LCSs, invaded Iwo Jima in February, 1945, assisting the Marines in landing.  
   From there, the LCS 31 went to Okinawa and fought suicide planes on radar picket duty where the #31 shot down 6 suicide planes and was hit by 3, killing 9 sailors and wounding 15. The 31 received the Presidential Unit Citation for their efforts. Please help in returning the LCS 102 to the United States and receiving the recognition that the LCSs deserve.  
   Mr. President, these ships were a part of the U.S. Navy that fought and won the war in the Pacific. The LCS 102 is the last remaining ship of its class, and I believe it would be appropriate for it to come home and serve as a floating museum and a monument to the brave service of tens of thousands of sailors who served on these ships with the nickname ``Mighty Midgets.'' 
   Since the Congress adopted an amendment 3 years ago urging the Secretary of Defense to bring home the LCS 102, the Navy has determined that the Thai Navy will give up the LCS from its fleet for a return to the United States, but they need a replacement ship to fulfill the shallow water mission now accomplished by the LCS 102. 
   This year, the Navy is retiring a small, fast gunboat from our fleet that would meet the Thai Navy's requirement. The ship is a Cyclone class ship. It could be made available to the Thai Navy in exchange for the LCS 102. This amendment authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to offer a Cyclone class ship to the Thai Navy. It does not mandate that the trade be consummated; it simply authorizes the trade if it can be negotiated and legal hurdles and other details can be worked out. 
   There is an urgency to this issue because World War II veterans are aging. Most of them are now in their seventies and eighties. If we are going to help the LCS association realize its dream and ambition of bringing home the last ship of its class, then we need to do it now. There are LCS sailors living today all over the country in almost all 50 States, and they would appreciate a vote in support of this amendment. 
   Funds will be raised from the private sector to put this ship in condition to serve as a museum, and there are still many details to be worked out before the LCS can be brought home. But by approving this amendment, which is necessary as a first step, the Senate will go on record in support, as we did 3 years ago when we suggested this should be done by the Navy.

If we had been able to get the committee to adopt the amendment as we had hoped they would, there would be report language in the committee report. I will be happy to give the Senator a copy of that which further explains. If he will let me, I will read it:  
   The committee recommends that the Secretary of the Navy be authorized to transfer to the Government of Thailand one Cyclone class patrol vessel for the purpose of supporting Thailand's counterdrug and  counterpiracy operations. The committee intends this transfer to replace the former LCS 102 currently in service with the Royal Thai Navy, should the discussions urged in section 1025 of PL 104-201 result in the Government of Thailand's decision to return LCS 102 to the Government of the United States. The committee understands that the Secretary of the Navy supports the return of LCS 102 to the United States for public display as a naval museum.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my colleague from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, in introducing the Crop Insurance Equity Act of 1999 to reform the federal crop insurance program. The other cosponsors of the bill are: Mr. COVERDELL, Mr. SESSIONS, MR. CLELAND, Mr. HOLLINGS, Mr. SHELBY, Mr. ROBB, and Mr. HUTCHINSON. 
   The Crop Insurance Equity Act of 1999 is based on several principles. First, we do not believe that the crop insurance program should be the next iteration of a farm bill. Therefore, this bill maintains the current policy with regard to federal subsidy for revenue insurance products. 
   We developed this bill with the intent of addressing the reasons farmers in our states have found crop insurance to be impractical. We believe that farmers from Washington to Florida and Maine to California will find this bill worthy of their support. 
   Our bill establishes a process under which the current rates and rating methods and procedures will be re-evaluated by USDA to examine factors not currently considered. This may lower crop insurance rates for some commodities. However, because all current rating methodologies are actuarially sound, if the re-evaluation would result in an increased rate, the current method must remain in place. 
   This bill also establishes a fixed percentage as the federal contribution to a farmer's crop insurance premium. Current law provides higher contributions for lower levels of coverage. This bill would treat all farmers fairly. 
   We believe that one of the simplest ways to make crop insurance more attractive is to make it operate more like other common forms of insurance, such as homeowners or auto insurance. This bill establishes a process of discounts and a menu of policy options from which farmers can choose. These include discounts for coverage of larger, less risky units of production, employment of technologically advanced agricultural management practices, and the reinstatement of good experience discounts. In addition, farmers will be able to choose whether to purchase specific coverages for prevented planting, quality losses, and cost of production coverage. 
   Mr. President, this bill raises the basic coverage level for the lowest crop insurance unit--catastrophic coverage--so that all farmers will benefit from this legislation. For the same minimal fee as established in current law, this bill will provide catastrophic coverage for sixty percent of a farmer's historical production at seventy percent of the market price. 
   Our bill also makes other important changes to the program. It protects new farmers or those who rent new land or produce new crops by ensuring they are assigned a fair yield until they generate adequate actual production data. 
   The legislation improves the management and oversight of the crop insurance program by establishing the Farm Service Agency as the sole agency for acreage and yield record keeping within USDA. It restructures the board of directors of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to include more farmers, and establishes a new office to work with private sector companies who develop new crop insurance products. 
   One of the major complaints that I have heard about crop insurance is the abuse and fraud that exists in the current program. To address this complaint, our bill also improves the monitoring of agents and adjusters to combat fraud, and strengthens the penalties available to USDA for companies, agents, and producers who engage in fraudulent activities. 
   I believe that we have developed a sound proposal which Senators will find good reason to support.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there has been some conversation about disaster assistance for farmers and complaints that this bill does not go far enough to address the needs in the agriculture community for disaster assistance. 
   I point out to Senators that there are funds in here that will provide guaranteed loans for those farmers who are having difficulty getting financing for this year's crop so that the Government will guarantee the repayment of that loan. That will allow them to get loans they otherwise would not be able to get because of the inability to show that this year's crop will produce a profit. 
   This is a real problem, and we are sensitive to that. We have had hearings on that subject, and we are aware of it. In this conference report, we spell out, in addition to the funds I have talked about already in the bill, the following:  
   The conferees recognize the problems facing agricultural producers today and understand that the actual needs for disaster assistance funds provided last year likely will exceed the projections of the Department of Agriculture. The Department of Agriculture has projected that net farm income will decline $3 billion below last year. The conferees expect the administration to monitor the situation closely and if necessary, submit requests for additional funds to the Congress for consideration.  
   This acknowledges that the problems are real. We know they are real. Last year was a big disaster in agriculture, and the Congress and the administration agreed to respond with a multibillion-dollar disaster assistance program. Some of the farmers have not gotten the benefits of that program yet. We provide funds to accelerate the availability of those benefits from the Department of Agriculture, and we are meeting every request that has been submitted by this administration for additional funds for that purpose. 
   The conference is sensitive to those needs. We did reject an amendment that was offered to increase the funding, and we hope the administration will let us know if additional funds are truly needed. 
   In many cases, it is impossible to determine what the assistance needs will be until after the crop year has begun. In many places, we have not even seen planting, but we do think this is responsive to that problem.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on March 17, of this year the Senate passed S. 257, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, by a vote of 97-3. Subsequently, the House adopted as H.R. 4 a different version of the legislation, and today the House has agreed to the substance of the Senate bill. No further action is required on the bill, and it now goes to the President for his signature. 
   After many years of debate, Congress has passed legislation stating the national policy to be that the United States will deploy a national missile defense as soon as technologically possible. 
   Section 2 of the bill notes that, like all discretionary programs, national missile defense is subject to the authorization and appropriation of funds. 
   Section 3 states that we support the continued reductions in Russian nuclear force levels. There is no linkage between Russian nuclear force levels, or any arms control agreement, and the national missile defense deployment policy of the bill. 
   I urge the President to sign this bill and put to rest the concerns of many that our country would continue its vulnerability to ballistic missile attack. With the signing of this bill, a new era of commitment to missile defense will begin.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Digital Education Act, a bill to amend title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I am pleased that the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, joins me in introducing this legislation to address some critical technology issues and the role of public broadcasting in education. 
   This bill expands Ready to Learn, a program of combined successful efforts in early childhood education. It expands MATHLINE, a proven model of teacher professional development, and it supports production of new digital educational material. The Digital Education Act includes innovative applications of progressive technology to promote the best practices in teaching and bring up to date information to classrooms throughout the country. 
   The Federal Government, State departments of education, local community businesses, and public television stations have made major investments in educational technology in recent years. These investments have focused on network infrastructure and computer hardware. It is time to invest in instructional resources that will make these new networks relevant and ensure that students and teachers are prepared to benefit fully from the new technology. 
   The Ready To Learn Television program, first authorized in 1994, has made a unique contribution to ensure that American children start school ``ready to learn.'' The program has funded an unprecedented blending of services, including quality children's educational television programming broadcast by the Public Broadcasting Service, and a variety of outreach services for parents, teachers and other care givers. 
   Ready to Learn outreach programs have had tremendous success. Local public television stations that subscribe to Ready to Learn provide training and other services to parents and care givers of preschoolchildren. Ready to Learn has grown from 10 public television stations to 130, reaching approximately 94 percent of the country. Each month Ready to Learn distributes over 35,000 books to children and over 900,000 copies of a custom parent/care giver magazine, specifically designed to integrate programming with reading. Ready to Learn is providing the opportunities for children and parents to build that foundation for success. Over 330,000 parents and child care professionals have been trained in using television to encourage reading. Using Ready to Learn techniques, these adults have nurtured the reading of 4,331,829 children. 
   The Mississippi Educational Network in my home State, targets outreach services to high poverty populations who are particularly disadvantaged.  The services include basic lessons in parenting, developmental benchmarks, health and nutrition, nurturing literacy in the home, and using the television programs children watch most to reinforce the lessons. 
   The families in these communities often have no reading material in their house. The first book given to a child by Mississippi Ready to Learn is quite likely to be the first book the child has ever owned. And, while Ready to Learn is designed for prekindergarten children, these families may have older children who may be equally in need. The local design of Ready to Learn allows the Mississippi director, Cassandra Washington, to tailor her workshops and even have a few older child books on hand for these families. Ms. Washington has been very resourceful in her outreach, finding non-traditional places for education, such as the Women Infants and Children Distribution Centers throughout Mississippi where families in need come regularly. 
   The International Reading Association stated recently, ``By the time children are exposed to beginning reading instruction in kindergarten and first grade, they should have a foundation that assures them early success. Recent studies indicate just how critical those positive early experiences are to cognitive development and lifelong reading.'' 
   Congressionally authorized and Federally funded research at the National Institutes of Health found that when parents read to their young children, it literally stimulates the brain development of the children. A recent University of Alabama study found that Ready to Learn families: watch 40 percent less television, watch more education-oriented programming, read more often with their children, read longer at each sitting, read for more educational and informational purposes, and took their children to libraries and bookstores more often than others. 
   Using the best research tested information available, Ready To Learn has driven the development of two major, commercial-free broadcast series for young children. The first, ``Dragon Tales,'' will begin airing this fall and will be integrated with carefully designed home and school resources to develop reading skills in young children. 
   The Digital Education Act will build on the early successes of Ready to Learn. It will authorize funding to increase station grants, produce new outreach and training activities, and generate more services for parents and care givers, so that more children start school truly ready to learn. 
   The Digital Education Act provides for the demonstration of early childhood education digital applications with public television stations that are technologically ready. Currently, there are digital broadcast public television stations in Mississippi, Massachusetts, Missouri, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Washington. These stations can transmit several programming services simultaneously. New applications include a dedicated channel for early childhood education and transmission of Internet accessible supplementary information text and video. 
   Today, children's programs produced by PBS and individual public broadcasting stations are among the television shows most watched by children and most used in classrooms. Many teachers and parents credit these programs for stimulating curiosity, educating, and encouraging continued learning through reading and other resources. The increased funding authorized in this bill will continue the investment of Ready to Learn resources in producing commercial-free children's programming of the highest educational quality. 
   Thirty years ago, Federal funding seeded the creation of Sesame Street. This carved out a meaningful place for educational children's programming as analog public television developed. The Digital Education Act stakes a new claim in the technological frontier for children and educational broadcasting and will ensure that this reinvention of television includes a major education component for children from the beginning. 
   The second element of the Digital Education Act concerns teacher professional development. In 1994, Congress authorized the ``Telecommunications Demonstration Project for Mathematics,'' which has supported a project called MATHLINE. Through MATHLINE, PBS has pioneered a new model of teacher professional development, utilizing a blend of technologies, including online communications and video, to provide quality resources and services to teachers of mathematics. 
   Through public and private funding, PBS MATHLINE developed The Elementary School Math Project for teachers, grades K-5; The Middle School Math Project for teachers, grades 5-8; The High School Math Project: Focus on Algebra for teachers, grades 7-12; and The Algebraic Thinking Math Project for teachers, grades 3-8. 
   Over 5,000 math teachers in 40 States and the District of Columbia have participated in MATHLINE. These innovative teaching techniques have taught more than 1.3 million students. 
   Three separate external evaluators have certified that MATHLINE is making a positive impact on the way teachers teach. For example, an evaluation of the Middle School Math Project by Rockman, et al. found, ``The impact of PBS MATHLINE is clear. It has influenced how teachers see themselves and helped them create a powerful and enriching mathematics environment in their classrooms *.*.* The gap between belief and performance is narrowing *.*.* The combination of viewing, communicating, and doing seems to have resulted in substantive changes in teaching.'' 
   The International Reading Association stated in February, ``The most effective professional development programs are those planned by teachers themselves, based on their assessments of their needs as educators and their students' needs as learners.'' MATHLINE does just that. It is real teachers, teaching real students, and passing success on to more teachers. The MATHLINE demonstration has worked. 
   Our legislation would authorize the New Century Program for Distributed Teacher Professional Development. Under this new program, the successful MATHLINE model will expand to other core curriculum areas, such as literature, science and social studies. It will also connect the digitized public broadcasting infrastructure with digital education networks at schools, colleges and universities throughout the nation. Nearly every teacher in the United States will have access to the New Century Program. 
   The third element of our legislation would authorize the Digital Education Content Collaborative. As a nation, we have made tremendous progress in the last decade bringing our schools from the 19th Century to 21st Century technologically. However, there is still one major element that needs to be in place to make it all work. That is world-class educational content that rivals video games for students' attention, is tied to state standards, which teachers seamlessly integrate into daily learning activities. 
   Programs distributed by public broadcast stations are used by more classroom teachers than any other because of their high quality and relevance to the curriculum. A survey commissioned by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 1997, found that 92 percent of teachers use videos to improve their lessons and public broadcasting programs were the highest rated. However, single channel analog distribution limited station services to a few hours per day of linear video broadcasts. 
   Digital broadcasting will dramatically increase and improve the types of services local public broadcasting stations can offer schools. One of the most exciting is the ability to broadcast multiple video channels and data information simultaneously. A vast library of instructional video materials could be distributed on full time, continuous channels and it could be available on demand, when teachers and students need it. Digitally produced programs will allow local stations broadcast flexibility and new interactive content that matches state standards and fits local curriculums. 
   As Members of the United States Senate, working to reauthorize the programs our elementary and secondary schools depend upon, we are also looking for successful models that lead to true educational reform and improvement.  
   The Digital Education Act takes the best of educational technology programing; improves those proven to work; and places renewed confidence in education's most trusted and successful content development partners. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to be associated with the public broadcasting community, and I am proud of their commitment to our earliest learners. I hope more Senators will join us in supporting this important education legislation.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Senate Resolution proclaiming this week Teacher Appreciation Week. 
   This week, in every state, students and parents are taking time to thank the school teachers, and we should too. They are the true heroes in our nation's effort to enrich the lives of all our citizens through education. 
   I want to pay tribute today to a special Mississippi teacher. She is Mississippi Teacher of the Year, Mrs. Tina Fisher Scholtes, of Sudduth Elementary School in Starkville, Mississippi. Tina has been an elementary school teacher for sixteen years. She has spent the past fourteen years teaching first grade in Starkville. 
   First grade lays the foundation for formal education. Every parent hopes their child will begin school with an excellent teacher. Tina Scholtes is without a doubt an excellent teacher. Being an excellent teacher requires hard work, along with respect for children and an understanding of the learning process. Tina has those attributes and more. She also cares about outcomes. She wants all her students to succeed. 
   Beyond the Masters Degree she earned at Mississippi State University, Tina has completed professional development for teaching reading and mathematics; the special needs of teaching deaf students; National Board Certification; and training other teachers. Her resume is evidence of her capacity for gaining knowledge and sharing it with others. While continuing her first grade teaching, she has returned to Mississippi State University where as a clinical instructor she directs the activities of student teachers. 
   Tina has brought new teaching techniques into the schools where she has taught. She serves as a mentor to new teachers and has developed school wide curriculum reforms. She also has used local television programs to provide early childhood education lessons to parents. 
   Another indication that she is a dedicated teacher is her participation in the Parent Teacher Association where she served as President while teaching at Emerson Elementary School. Tina recognizes the importance of teachers participating in the community and is active in her church, and in other community activities. 
   I was very pleased that Tina Scholtes took time to visit my office when she was in Washington recently for the National Teacher of the Year recognition events. 
   I congratulate her on all her successes. The first graders in Starkville, Mississippi are lucky, indeed, to begin their lives as students with Tina Scholtes, and we are all grateful to her for being such a good example for other teachers to follow.

    Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, when the Mississippi Symphony Orchestra concludes its 54th season with its traditional ``Pops Concert'' in Jackson on May 7, Maestro Colman Pearce will retire after twelve years as music director and principal conductor. During his tenure, Pearce has brought life and vigor to the mission of the Mississippi Symphony Orchestra. He has projected  enormous energy into the task of developing audiences from preschoolers to senior citizens, and all ages in between. 
   Maestro Pearce is a gifted conductor of international renown with a brilliant knowledge of musical styles and repertoire. He is an equally gifted pianist and composer. His keen Irish wit, personal charm, enthusiasm, and intellect, combined with a willingness to spread the joy of music whenever and wherever, and special gifts. 
   When Colman came to Mississippi in 1987, he found a group of superb players, an enthusiastic Board of Governors, and a loyal army of volunteers known as the Symphony League. He was aware of a financial deficit, of unrest among the musicians, and of declining audience support. Quickly garnering the support of the board, league and the musicians, Maestro Pearce forged ahead. After a few successful seasons, he led the orchestra into statewide status and it became the Mississippi Symphony. 
   Colman's musicianship, intellect, vision, and savoir faire have made him an appealing stage presence in venues beyond the formal concert halls. He has taken the MSO everywhere audiences can be found--ball parks, schools, city streets, shopping malls, theaters, lakesides, and beaches. Thousands of Mississippians have come to recognize Colman and the musicians by name and by instrument. They have identified with the Symphony as a Mississippi ``product'' of which they are proud. The Symphony has become an accessible commodity across the State. 
   Upgrading the quality of musical offerings, especially in formal concert halls, has been his major focus. However, he has expanded the goals and outreach to include programs at all levels: 
   Chamber Orchestra.--Twenty-eight core musicians present concerts within the regular season at Millsaps College Recital Hall and the Briarwood Presbyterian Church sanctuary. These concerts are viewed as ``learning experiences'' since the programs are always sprinkled with biographical data and interesting anecdotes about the composers whose works are being performed. Programming is innovative, often including contemporary music. Colman plays twentieth century music with flair, challenging the understanding and enjoyment of both the musicians and their audiences. 
   Children's Concerts.--More than 4,000 children in grades three, four, and five literally pack Jackson's city auditorium annually when Colman directs the special concerts. He assists teachers in area schools in the preparation of study materials to acquaint students with the program they will hear. 
   Kinderconcerts.--Programs are planned according to the attention span of pre-school children with emphasis on short classical and new music. Colman has featured the work of Mississippi composer Luigi Zananelli (``The Steadfast Tin Soldier''), and an adaptation of the Dr. Seuss classic, ``Green Eggs and Ham'', to the delight of the young audiences. 
   Academic and Performing Arts Complex.--This branch of the Jackson Public School system has been supported by Colman through lectures, by allowing students to attend orchestra rehearsals, and through invitations to music and dance students to actually perform with the Symphony. 
   Young Artist Competition.--In addition to showcasing young talent whenever possible, Colman has judged competitions, offering insightful feedback to contestants. Winners have often been invited to perform with the Chamber Orchestra. 
   Family Fun Concerts.--In addition to enjoyable and easy listening music performed by the Symphony, the concerts have featured other attractions, such as mimes, dancers, and storytellers, in a casual setting. Colman's final Family Fun Concert featured a performance of Walter Anderson's ``Robinson the Cat,'' a work composed by Maestro Pearce in collaboration with mezzo-soprano Lester Senter Wilson. 
   Pops Concerts.--Old Trace Park at the Reservoir has been the scene of the Symphony Pops for many years, with residents of a five county area gathering on the shore (and in the water) for an early summer evening concert of semi-classical and popular music. 
   The Messiah.--Under the direction of Maestro Pearce, the Mississippi Symphony Orchestra has presented the ``definitive'' performance of Handel's Christmas classic in Thalia Mara Hall each December. Soloists are chosen from throughout the state, and choirs from the state's colleges and universities have been showcased. In recent years, the famed Mississippi Chorus has been featured. 
   A native of Ireland with an honors degree from the National University of Ireland, Dublin, Colman Pearce studied conducting with Franco Ferrara in Hilversum and Hans Swarowsky in Vienna. In 1965, he began a long association with the Irish National Broadcasting Organization, serving as Co-principal, Principal, and now Conductor Laureate of the Irish Radio and Television Symphony Orchestra (now called the National Symphony Orchestra.) In the years prior to accepting his position with the Mississippi Symphony Orchestra and since, he has maintained a busy schedule as a guest conductor in other parts of the United States, and in Brazil, Canada, Argentina, Germany, France, Belgium, Sweden, Spain, Iceland, Israel, Hungary, and in the United Kingdom. 
   Maestro Pearce will now concentrate upon his activities as a pianist, arranger and composer, his recordings of contemporary works, and upon guest conducting from his home in Dublin. 
   Colman leaves the Mississippi Symphony Orchestra financially sound, having established record setting season ticket sales and significantly broadened the orchestra's constituency. 
   When Colman came to Mississippi twelve years ago, he immediately accepted and embraced the best in Mississippians and set about adding value to the state through his development of the orchestra. With his Irish charm, good humor, talent, artistic commitment, and resourceful programming, he has also won the hearts of many Mississippians who now bid him ``Goodbye, and Godspeed.''

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend and distinguished colleague, the Senator from Arizona, in introducing this resolution. It seems to me very important at this juncture that the Senate express itself on the subject of our obligation to use whatever force is available to our alliance in NATO to win the conflict quickly and decisively and not to be a party to dragging it out unnecessarily by telling our adversary what military actions we will not use in the conflict. 
   It seems to me that an appropriate analogy to the administration's strategy is someone who gets himself into a fight, a boxing match, and says, ``I am just going to use a left jab in this match, I am never going to use the right hand.'' No one would do that with any expectation of being successful in that conflict, in that encounter. It seems to me that that is exactly what the United States has been doing, and it has been a mistake. 
   This resolution suggests by its clear language that the President of the United States is authorized to use all necessary force and other means, in concert with United States allies, to accomplish United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization objectives in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
   It also spells out in the resolution what those objectives are. It suggests that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia withdraw its forces from Kosovo, permitting the ethnic Albanians to return to their homes and the establishment of a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Those are our objectives. 
   To accomplish that, we must convince Milosevic that we are very serious that this war will be waged with all necessary force unless he surrenders his efforts to intimidate, kill, and 
   otherwise terrify this region of Europe, and that he stop this military action, and stop it now, or he is going to suffer the most serious military consequences. 
   That is the message he should get from the NATO alliance and from the U.S. leadership. That is what the Senate is saying by adopting this resolution. And I hope the Senate will adopt this resolution. 
   It is unfortunate that we are involved in this military action. It is very unpleasant. It is not something that any of us would have wished to have occurred. We do have to recognize, though, that our NATO allies are very actively involved in this conflict as well. Great Britain, France, Germany, and Italy are all taking--and others--very active roles in the prosecution of this military conflict to achieve the goals that are recited in this resolution. It is an honorable course of action to stop the killing and to stop the atrocities and restore stability in this region of Europe. 
   The NATO alliance was begun on the premise that Europe should be free, with an opportunity for people to live their lives in freedom, without threat from military intimidation or harm. The alliance has decided that this is an appropriate means for achieving that goal, waging a conflict against a person who has proven to be totally disrespectful of human rights, of the right to life, of the right to live in peace with his neighbors. We can no longer tolerate this under any circumstances. 
   So the NATO alliance is involved. And I am hopeful that the Senate will spell out our views on this issue at the earliest possible time. 
   Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.

    Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I bring to the Senate's attention the retirement of Mr. David Wolfe, the Deputy District Engineer for Project Management at the Memphis District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
   Mr. Wolf held several positions during his 39 years with the District, including Assistant Chief of Planning Division, Chief of the Information Management Office, and Chief of the Planning Division. He has served as Deputy District Engineer since 1994. 
   During his time at the Memphis District, Mr. Wolf initiated several projects unique to the District and the Corps of Engineers. The Grand Prairie Region and Bayou Meto Basin, Arkansas Project provides irrigation for agriculture and reverses the depletion of groundwater supply in central Arkansas. The Magnolia Street Project in Hickman, Kentucky is a soil-saving, bluff stability project. Serving as a member of the Mississippi Valley Division's Resource Management Board, Mr. Wolfe led the merging of Memphis District's Planning Division with the Programs and Project Management Division. 
   Mr. Wolfe's outstanding technical and leadership capabilities have made him a vital resource for my office and the people of Mississippi. In particular, he should be recognized for his assistance to the flood control needs of northwest Mississippi. 
   Upon his retirement on March 31, 1999, Mr. Wolfe was presented with the Bronze de Fleury Medal in recognition of his contributions to the Engineer Regiment. 
   I know that all Senators join me in thanking David for his many years of service and in wishing him our best for his retirement.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, before the Senate adjourned for the Easter recess, my State of Mississippi suffered the loss of one of its finest citizens, Richard Baxter Wilson, who died on Monday, March 15. He was a national leader in the electric power industry. He served as a member of the board of directors of Middle South Utilities, Inc., the Edison Electric Institute, and the National Association of Electric Companies. 
   In addition to serving as president and chairman of the board of Mississippi Power & Light Company, he was also a member of many other corporate, charitable, civic, and educational institution boards. 
   He was a personal friend of mine whose advice and counsel I appreciated and relied upon, to my great benefit. His two children, Richard B. Wilson, Jr. and Miriam Weems, are two of my closest and dearest friends. And I extend to them, and all the members of the family, my sincerest condolences.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today one of my State's most famous citizens of all time celebrates her 90th birthday. Eudora Welty is known around the world as a writer of enormous talent and accomplishment. She has lived for most of her life in Jackson, MS, and she enjoys a level of popularity in our State that a politician can envy but not match. 
   I invite the attention of all Senators to the May issue of Vanity Fair which contains a toast to Eudora by my friend and fellow Mississippian, Willie Morris. 
   In today's edition of the Jackson Clarion-Ledger, an article describes other activities that will be taking place in our State to honor Miss Welty on her 90th birthday.

For the information of all Senators, the Senate will reconvene on Wednesday at 11:30 a.m. and begin a period of morning business until 1 p.m. 
   Following morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 767, a bill introduced by Senator COVERDELL and others regarding tax filing extensions for certain members of the uniformed services. Following passage of that bill, it will be the leader's intention to begin consideration of the budget resolution conference report. There are 10 hours for debate on the conference report, but it is hoped that a significant portion of that time will be yielded back. 
   Members should, therefore, expect rollcall votes throughout Wednesday's session of the Senate in relation to the Coverdell bill or any other legislative or executive items cleared for action.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I regret that because of my father's funeral in Mississippi yesterday, I was not present in the Senate to vote on S. Con. Res. 21, authorizing the President of the United States to conduct military air operations and missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). Had I been present, I would have voted ``aye'' on the resolution. 
   The authorization is carefully limited and is designed to permit the participation of military forces of the United States, in concert with NATO allies, in an action to respond to a clear threat to the security and stability of Europe and indirectly to our own security interests. 
   It is my hope that this action will serve to signal the willingness of the United States government to keep its commitments under the NATO treaty and to be a force for peace and freedom in the region sought to be protected by the alliance.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we were all saddened by the accident involving the City of New Orleans Amtrak train in Illinois on Monday night. 
   Several Mississippians lost their lives in the accident including June Bonnin of Nesbit, and Raney and Lacey Lipscomb of Lake Cormorant. I know my colleagues join me in extending our sympathy to their families. 
   Mr. President, as is so often the case, tragedies such as this can bring out the best in individuals. Based on information provided to my office, it appears that three of the students from Covenant Christian High School in Clinton, Mississippi, who were on the train, became heroes. 
   These students were part of a group of 15 students returning from a spring break trip to Canada. According to persons on the scene, Michael Freeman, Caleb McNair, and Jeffrey Sartor, all 17-year-old Clinton residents, quickly reacted to the situation. 
   With fire quickly approaching from a nearby car, Michael and Caleb opened a window and began rescuing people trapped inside the train. Jeffrey and Mrs. Phyllis Hurley, a chaperone who was injured herself, began helping people get out of the train too. 
   Caleb also assisted firefighters in getting elderly people to safety and getting a young girl freed from the wreckage. When firefighters and other help arrived, Michael was still on top of a car helping people from other cars over to the closest ladder and down from the train. Even after the young men were escorted to the side, they continued to help carry stretchers of wounded to safety. 
   Mr. President, I extend my sympathy to all the victims and their families affected by the tragedy, and I commend the efforts of these young people and the many firefighters and emergency personnel who acted to save lives and assist the victims.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, it seems to me clear from the language in the bill that we contemplate the development of a system that is effective. We use that word--an ``effective'' ballistic missile defense, and that the deployment would take place when it is technologically possible. So when the technology is matured, it is proven to work, and we know the missile system would be effective to defend against ballistic missile attack. That is what the sentiment is. That is the policy that is reflected in the language that is used in the bill. 
   So that is consistent with the intent that this Senator has, as an author of  the bill. And in discussing it with other cosponsors, I think that is the sentiment of the Senate and would be reflected in future authorization and appropriations measures. That is another part to this as well. And one of the concerns, I think, with the amendment that the Senator has sent to the desk is that it could be construed, with a delegation of authority to the executive branch, to remove Congress from the decisionmaking process. We think Congress has a very important role to play in oversight and also in the authorization of deployment and the funding of deployment decisions that will be made in this weapons system development and deployment. 
   So those are my reactions, my sentiments. I hope that they are not inconsistent with the concerns of the Senator from New Mexico. And I really do not think they are.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, I appreciate his allowing me to comment further. 
   So the RECORD is complete, I would like to read into the RECORD some comments that I wrote down after considering the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico. 
   This bill is intended to establish a broad policy, stating the intent of the United States to defend itself against limited ballistic missile attack. 
   It does not seek to micromanage the Defense Department's conduct of the program. It gives the Department of Defense flexibility in determining whether the national missile defense system is effective and technologically ready for deployment. That decision will be made with congressional involvement and oversight provided by the appropriate committees. 
   The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology has stated in testimony before the Armed Services Committee that the criteria to be used by the Defense Department in making such determinations are tailored to the needs of individual programs and the urgency of the threat they are intended to address. 
   So I think with those further statements we show what we consider to be the meaning of the bill, the effect of the bill, and its relationship between the Congress and the administration.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, with respect to the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, I thank him for discussing the amendment with managers before offering it. As I understand the amendment, it calls for a report on a wide variety of threats facing the United States. S. 257, the pending legislation, is intended to address one of these threats--a limited ballistic missile attack against us for which we have no defense. 
   While these other threats are important, they are not the subject of this bill. We have tried to keep this bill focused on a specific policy question--whether the United States will defend itself against ballistic missile attack. We have tried not to entangle this question in the details of other defense issues, however important they may be. 
   If a report on the many other threats from weapons of mass destruction would be useful, the defense authorization or appropriations bills would be appropriate vehicles for directing such reporting requirements. As a matter of fact, it is our understanding that a similar requirement for a study is being conducted and is being complied with in response to a directive in the intelligence authorization bill for fiscal year 1999. 
   In conclusion, just because there are some threats that we cannot defend against perfectly doesn't mean we should not defend against others. 
   So, while being sympathetic with the suggestion that the Senator is making, we think this can be accomplished; the goal can be accomplished that he has pointed out by using the vehicles of the Intelligence Committee authorization, as is now being done to some extent, and the authorization and appropriations bills that will later be considered by the Senate this year.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for that kind gesture and express again my appreciation for his assistance in the development of the legislation and the passage of this bill. 
   By this vote, the Senate has done what has never been done before. It has passed legislation making it the policy of the United States to deploy a national missile defense system capable against rogue-state threats as soon as the technology to do so is ready. 
   By this action, the Senate has sent an unmistakable message around the world: 
   To rogue states, that America will marshal its technological resources and refuse to be vulnerable to their ballistic missile threats of coercion; 
   To our allies, that the United States will continue to be a reliable alliance partner; 
   To other nations, that no country will have any form of veto over America protecting its security interests; 
   To those working on the development of a national missile defense, that their work is valued and the system will be deployed just as soon as it is ready to protect America; 
   And most of all, to the American people, who will no longer have cause to wonder if their Government intends to fulfill its most fundamental responsibility. 
   In my opening statement I said we have heard many statements that have been made to reassure us about the willingness of the United States to defend itself. But there is always an ``if'' attached--if the threat appears, if we can afford it, if other nations give us their permission. By our actions today, we have removed what Winston Churchill called ``the terrible ifs.'' 
   Without doubt, there will be other challenges ahead for national missile defense. There will be test failures as well as successes, but we will not be deterred from continuing to test until we develop a system that works. 
   There will be discussions with other nations on arms control issues. But now these discussions will not begin with the question of whether America will protect itself. By this vote we have taken the necessary first step to protecting the United States from long-range ballistic missile attack. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN, the ranking minority member on the Armed Services Committee, for his cooperation as floor manager for the minority. I also thank all Senators who came to the floor to speak on the bill, and especially those Senators who cosponsored the bill. And finally, I thank my staff members, Mitch Kugler and Dennis Ward, whose excellent assistance to me  and other supporters of this legislation has been very helpful indeed. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

I am certainly not, in any way, sad that we didn't spend the time that we had earlier set aside for the Missile Defense Act. I am very glad the Senate acted as it did to make this very important statement about his service and his contribution during that period in our country's history. He has certainly earned the respect not only of the Senate for his service but of the American people as well. I am glad to join with those who pay tribute to him this morning.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, yesterday, we began debate of the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. We have reached a point where we will soon be voting on an amendment that seeks to more clearly define the context for this legislation and the purpose we see that it will serve. This legislation is a statement of a new policy for our Government with respect to the need to develop and deploy a national missile defense system as soon as technology permits. 
   It is very clear from recent developments that we identified yesterday that we are confronted with a very real threat to our national security interests from ballistic missile technology, the proliferation of this technology, and the capacity of other countries to use it to deliver weapons of mass destruction against the territory of the United States. 
   Americans today are completely vulnerable to a ballistic missile attack. We need to see that that is changed. We need to see that the technology that we have available to us is used to develop and deploy a defense against ballistic missile attack to protect American security interests and American citizens. 
   During the discussion yesterday, there was some suggestion that administration officials and military officials in our country were opposed to this legislation. I must say that I heard some of these officials testify at hearings, and I disagree with that conclusion. I think there is ample evidence in the record of our Defense Appropriations Subcommittee hearings, and in other statements that officials have made, both civilian and military officials, to the media about their views on this subject, that we can draw a completely different conclusion from the conclusion that was expressed yesterday by some of those who participated in this debate. 
   Let me give you one example. The other day, on March 3, I was in a meeting of our Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. We were having a hearing reviewing the request for funds for the Department of Defense for the next fiscal year. The Deputy Secretary of Defense, Dr. Hamre, was a witness, and we started a discussion about whether or not the administration interpreted this legislation that is pending now in the Senate to mean that the Department of Defense should disregard measures relating to the operational effectiveness of developmental testing in determining whether the national missile defense system is technologically ready  to provide an effective defense against limited ballistic missile attack. 
   I asked Dr. Hamre, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, what his interpretation of that legislation was, and if he read the language in a way that suggested we would be deploying an operationally ineffective system or would require the administration to do so. Here is what the Deputy Secretary of Defense said. I am quoting.  
   No, sir ..... I read the language that it says that you would still expect us to be good program managers. You would still expect us to do testing, disciplined rigorous testing. Not slowing things up just to test for test's sake but to do disciplined testing and know that it really would be effective and that it really would work.  
   So it is clear from that response to my question that in the mind of the Deputy Secretary of Defense this bill does not require deployment of a missile defense system that is operationally ineffective. On the contrary, he understands clearly, as do the cosponsors of this legislation, that we would put in place a policy and a practice that is common and ordinary in the acquisition process in our Department of Defense. 
   Finally, to those who suggest that a deployment decision should wait yet another evaluation of the threat, which was one of the four additional criteria outlined yesterday by the distinguished Senator from Michigan, I think a quote attributed to General Lyles, who is the Director of the Ballistic Missile Organization, might be helpful. He was asked again at a January press conference whether another evaluation of the threat would be necessary when the administration gave the go-ahead for production of the national missile defense system. This is what he said. I quote: 
   The key decision will be on the technological readiness. My statement about looking at the threat, that's something we do for all programs all the time. So yes, we will again look at the threat. But as the Secretary stated, we are affirming today that the threat is real and growing, so that's not an issue. But we will always look at the threat to see has it changed, is it coming from a different source, etc.? That's part of anything we do for any program.  
   So there is really no question in the minds of the military managers and the civilian leadership at the Department of Defense about the threat. In General Lyles' view, or in the view of Dr. Hamre, and as stated, as Senators know, by the Secretary of Defense, our former colleague, former Senator Cohen, it is routine and a matter of course that there will be a continued evaluation and a monitoring of the threat. But the question as to whether the threat of ballistic missile attack exists now against the United States has been more clearly demonstrated by the actions of North Korea than any other thing anybody can say. The evidence is hard and clear and obvious. There is a capability now in North Korea to launch a missile--multiple stage--with a solid fuel, third stage, with a capacity to reach the territory of the United States. 
   As Secretary Cohen said when he came to talk to Senators not too long ago, ``We have checked the threat box.'' ``We have checked the threat box.'' The threat is clear. It is present. The threat exists. 
   That is why the administration's policy of waiting to see whether a threat develops to then decide whether we deploy a system that we have developed is an outdated policy and needs to be replaced with a current policy that matches the facts and the realities of our situation. 
   That is why this legislation is needed, and that is why this amendment is important, because it restates that the policy will be subject to the annual review of the authorization committees, of the appropriations committees, as every defense acquisition system is under current practices. That is what this pending amendment suggests--that we will see the jurisdictional responsibilities for authorizing a deployment, and funding the deployment will be constrained by budget considerations, by the realities of the threat as it then exists on the regular annual processes that this Congress follows each year. 
   The administration will have an opportunity to sign those bills, or veto them. So we are not changing the policies, or practices, or rules, or the laws that govern the appropriations and the authorization processes of Congress. That is what this amendment clearly suggests. 
   I am hopeful that with this further information that is available to the Senate as we proceed to wind up debate on this amendment Senators will ask whatever questions they have, and we will be glad to try to respond to them. 
   We appreciate having the cosponsorship for this amendment of the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Senator INOUYE, who is the senior member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator WARNER, who is the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Senator LIEBERMAN, who is also active in the review and assistance on this issue. 
   Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as I indicated earlier, I support the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Louisiana and thank her for her contribution to strengthening the legislation. Like the statement of policy already contained in S. 257, this is a straightforward statement of an important national security goal. 
   The high levels of strategic forces deployed during the cold war are no longer necessary in today's vastly changed strategic environment. Already our two countries have reduced levels significantly through START I and will reduce them further under START II. Both policies articulated here, our determination to deploy a missile defense against limited threats and our continued interest in further offensive reductions, are in our interests. Of course, inclusion of both in this bill does not imply that one is contingent upon the other, but that is completely consistent with what we have been saying all along--that defensive and offensive reductions are not incompatible. I urge all Senators to support the amendment. 
   I also urge Senators, if they have other amendments, to let us know about them. I am hoping that we can get an agreement that would identify any other amendments and that we can have a time limit agreed upon with respect to those amendments. If there are no other amendments, it would be our expectation that we could go to third reading within a short period of time. Senators communicating that to the managers or their intentions to the managers would be appreciated very much so we could go forward with the expeditious handling and conclusion of the bill. 
   I yield back whatever time remains, and I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 will make it the policy of the United States to deploy an effective missile defense system to defend against a limited ballistic missile attack as soon as technologically possible. Today, American citizens are completely vulnerable to ballistic missile attack. 
   Last year, when the Senate debated similar legislation, some suggested that our bill was premature, that there was not yet any reason to suspect that we were confronted with a ballistic missile threat. Now, however, there is no disagreement about the nature of the threat. Consider these recent developments:

<TEXT>
   Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, it is interesting to hear the comments of my good friend from Michigan. It reminds me, though, of someone who has heard what this bill is about but really hasn't read the fine print yet. That is one reason why when the bill was reported I was hopeful that we could start off by reading the bill. It is very short. Unlike the legislation that was debated last year in the Senate, this bill has really a very small operative section. It is so small and clear and concise that I could almost recite it. I am sure I would leave out something. But the operative words are that it will be the policy upon the passage of this legislation for the United States to deploy a missile defense system--an effective missile defense system--that would be capable of defending the United States against limited ballistic missile attack as soon as technologically possible, and that that attack would include missiles that were launched either intentionally, accidentally or unauthorized. That is the bill that we are debating here. 
   The suggestion that we are insisting on the passage of this bill that the administration immediately deploy a system that may not be workable, that may not be operationally effective, ignores the clear wording of the legislation. It describes the missile defense system that we are directing be deployed as an effective ballistic missile system. So that is taken care of. 
   The amendment that has been submitted, which I hope will be adopted by the Senate on a voice vote--it certainly is not controversial or it should not be controversial--says that the deployment would be subject to the authorization of appropriations and the appropriation of funds by the committees of jurisdiction of the Congress. 
   Like any other defense system or new acquisition of weapons system by the Department of Defense, the deployment of a national missile defense system will be subject to the review of the committees with jurisdiction over that subject in the Congress, and bills to authorize the deployment and to fund the deployment will have to be passed and they will have to be signed by the President. 
   The suggestion that the passage of this bill is the final step in the process misses the point completely. It is the first step in the process. We are trying to correct an outdated, outmoded, irrelevant policy of wait and see--wait and see if a threat to the security interests of the United 
   States develops from ballistic missiles. 
   We have waited, and we have seen. We have seen the testing of a multistage rocket by North Korea which they said was launched for the purpose of putting a satellite in orbit. Our analysts have been reported as saying that missile system used a solid fuel in its last stage. It would be capable of striking the territory of Hawaii and Alaska, and the last time I checked, they were part of the United States. 
   At the present time, we have no defense against such a ballistic missile attack from a rocket like that or from a missile. The design or possible uses are virtually the same. 
   We are also puzzled over the fact that the Senator seems to suggest in his statement that our relationship with Russia is going to be put at risk if we adopt this bill, the first step in a process to correct an outdated policy. This is our policy. This is our policy to defend the security interests of the United States and American citizens who might be at risk from a ballistic missile attack and weapons of mass destruction that could be delivered by long-range, speedier missiles. 
   We have known for some time that our administration has been trying to negotiate a so-called demarcation agreement with Russia, distinguishing between theater missile defense capability and other kinds of missile defense capabilities. It has been an excruciating process to watch, and we basically have watched in the Congress as the administration has reached agreements or suggestions of agreements reduced to memoranda of understanding, not submitted to the Senate for ratification as amendments to the ABM Treaty, but changes, nonetheless, in the definition of what is permissible and possible for us to do as a matter of our own national security interests with respect to theater defensive missiles. It limits the speed at which our interceptors can be tested against targets. 
   The point of this is, this administration has gone to great lengths to try to manage the relationship with Russia so as not to ruffle any feathers, not to upset Russia. Ask Mr. Primakov when he comes to the United States why hasn't his government, his government parliamentarians, ratified START II. 
   This is an effort to reach an agreement and an arrangement with Russia to reduce and limit strategic arms, missiles systems and nuclear weapons capabilities. We ratified that agreement 3 years ago in the Senate. Russia has not kept its part of the bargain by ratifying that agreement. 
   My point in saying this is that the relationship between the Russians and the United States is of great importance to us, to me, to this Senate. We cannot ignore the fact that Russia remains heavily armed with nuclear weapons and missile capabilities like no other country in the world, other than the United States. We do have concerns about that relationship. We should take care to try to reach understandings with the Russians on these matters, and I think we will continue to work closely with our administration officials as they negotiate, discuss and try to reach understandings about what are our intentions. 
   We are not trying to upset the strategic balance between the United States and Russia on missile capability or nuclear weapons or the like. We are trying to change a policy about our relationship with other States that are developing weapons that are capable of threatening our security where we do not have a history of much success. 
   North Korea is an example. There are other nation states that are now engaged in developing missile capabilities where their missiles can go much farther and much faster than they have in the past, and we have to take that into account. We would be derelict in our duty if we did not. 
   We think this administration is behind the curve on the policy decisions with respect to ballistic missile defense, and it is putting the security interests of the United States at risk. That is what we are trying to correct. 
   We are not trying to answer every question that can be raised or every issue involved in ballistic missile defense in this one bill. It just cannot be done. But that is the test that my good friend is trying to measure this bill against. Does it answer every question? Does it answer the question of whether or not a system will be adequately tested? No. But before the Congress will authorize the deployment of a system, it is bound to insist that there be some indication that it is workable, that it is effective. That is why we use the phrase ``effective ballistic missile defense system'' in this bill. We also want to make sure it is ``technologically feasible or possible'' for us to  field a system. And that is why we use that phrase in this bill. 
   What we are hoping to accomplish is to make this administration recognize that there is a legitimate concern. The threat exists today to the security interests because of developments we have seen over the last several years. Senators will remember that our subcommittee had 2 years of hearings analyzing the problems of proliferation of missile technology, other technologies, computer technology, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the easy access that some countries have to information here in the United States, over the Internet, at universities, at laboratories--we have heard a lot about that recently--at laboratories here in the United States. You can get information from those sources, and you can use them then if you are a country that needs to upgrade its missile capability or nuclear weapons capability. There are suggestions that that has been happening. Are we to just close our eyes to that? Are we to ignore that and say, ``Well, let's wait and see what happens''? 
   We have been waiting, and we have seen what has happened in North Korea, in Iran, in China, in other countries as well. All of these facts now convince us, the authors and the sponsors of this legislation, that it is time to change our policy. That is what the passage of this bill will do. It will put an end to the outdated wait-and-see policy of the Clinton administration on this issue, and it will say that as a matter of national policy we will deploy an effective ballistic missile defense system as soon as technologically possible to defend our country against limited ballistic missile attack--whether unintentional, unauthorized, or deliberate. 
   I suggest we keep in mind that we dedicated that proliferation report from our 2 years of hearings to the 28 U.S. servicemen who were killed in the gulf war with a Scud missile. That was several years ago. We have 8 years of experience to build on from that event. But that got the attention of the American people and the families of those soldiers who were killed that the United States is vulnerable and its service men and women and its citizens and its embassies all around the world are very vulnerable to missile attack and other attacks by weapons of mass destruction. 
   This bill does not solve all those problems but it states as a matter of national policy that we are not going to sit back and wait and see any longer. We are going to move, and as quickly as technologically possible, we are going to deploy a national missile defense system. 
   I am convinced that that is the right policy. We are not going to disregard our obligations to work toward improving relationships with Russia or China or other countries. That is a part of our responsibility, too. But 
   neither are we going to sacrifice the security of our citizens to those relationships. We are, first of all, going to protect the security interests of this country. That is the highest priority we have as Members of this body. 
   We have every reason to believe that there are clear and present dangers to the security of American citizens and our country. This is a step, a first step, toward changing that policy and doing what has to be done to fully protect our security interests.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished majority leader for calling up the national missile defense bill and also compliment the Democratic leader for refraining from objecting to proceeding to consider this bill at this time. 
   Senators may remember that this is the bill that was brought up on two occasions during the last session of the Senate and objections were made to considering the bill, a motion to proceed to consider the bill was filed, and then it was necessary to file a cloture motion to shut off debate to get to the bill. On both of those occasions we fell one vote short of invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to consider the bill. So this Senate has agreed to take up this legislation without objection. This is progress, and we are very proud to see this momentum to address this issue that is so important for the national security interests of the United States.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to amend the Foreign Language Assistance Program which is administered under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  
   The Foreign Language Education Improvement Amendments of 1999 make changes that encourage and make possible the teaching of a second language to students in elementary and secondary schools with limited resources--in particular, those schools heavily impacted by the unique problems of educating a high population of disadvantaged students. 
   My bill also provides schools an incentive to initiate foreign language programs, promotes technology, distance learning, and other innovative activities in the effective instruction of a foreign language. 
   Recent research about the human brain and language acquisition, which we've heard a lot about in connection to the teaching of reading and early childhood development, revealed that the ability to learn new languages is highest between birth and age six. ``Windows of opportunity'' is how a February 3, 1997, Time article described this neurological function, which effectively is open and pliable during the early years of life and closes by the age of ten. 
   We all know, from personal and other practical experience, that of course, people learn foreign languages beyond the age of ten. But, the enlightening fact of the research is that humans learn languages easier, and best at an early age. 
   The National School Boards Association publication, School Board News, printed an article in July, 1997 that describes early foreign language programs, and the benefits of learning languages early:  
   According to the Center for Applied Linguistics (CAL) in Washington, D.C., the early study of a second language offers many benefits for students, including gains in academic achievement, positive attitudes toward diversity, increased flexibility in thinking, greater sensitivity to language, and a better ear for listening and pronunciation. Foreign language study also improves children's understanding of their native language, increase creativity, helps students get better SAT scores, and increase their job opportunities.  
   The evidence shows that children who learn foreign languages score higher in all academic subjects than those who speak only English. Most developed countries recognize this and, according to the National Foreign Language Center, the United States is alone in not teaching foreign languages routinely before the age of twelve. Congress recognized the need for foreign language study when it passed Goals 2000 in 1994, making foreign language acquisition an education priority. 
   In February of this year, the Center for Applied Linguistics released the results of a U.S. Department of Education funded survey of foreign language teaching in preschool through 12th grade in the United States. The results show a rising awareness and increase in the teaching of foreign languages, but in the 31 percent of elementary schools that offer foreign language instruction, only 21 percent have proficiency as the goal of the program. Among the most frequently cited problems facing foreign language programs were inadequate funding, inadequate in-service teacher training, teacher shortages and a lack of sequencing from elementary to secondary school. 
   This survey is a good snapshot of the state of the teaching of foreign languages K-12 in our country. It can be read as encouraging: that we know we should be teaching languages earlier; that more schools are attempting to teach foreign languages; and that more languages are being taught. It also clearly shows where we need improvement: that we need to show accomplishment in teaching our students foreign languages; that more schools need to have the resources to offer the necessary course work for attaining this skill; and, that foreign languages should be a priority. 
   The advantages of having foreign language ability range from greater opportunities for college admission to fulfilling national security needs. The National Council for Languages and International Studies found that the top attainable skill cited as a determining factor for likely college admission is foreign language proficiency. There are also social and cultural tolerance advantages that the National Council for Languages and International Studies and others cite, which most of us can appreciate. According to a February 1998, USA Today survey, top executives of America's businesses cited a need for and lack of foreign language skills twice as great as any other skill in demand. 
   The National Foreign Language Center published a 1999 report titled, Language and National Security for the 21st Century: The Federal Role in Supporting National Language Capacity. This report is very compelling in its review of the need for military and civilian personnel with foreign language capability, and the lack thereof in our current and rising workforces. Here are some quotes from that report:  
   For example, the admission of a DEA official in September, 1997 that the agency lacks sufficient Russian language expertise to combat organized crime in groups from the former Soviet Union indicates a shortfall in supply of such expertise. * * * * * 
   The Foreign Service reports that only 60% of its billets requiring language are at present filled, with waivers applied to the other 35%. * * * * * 
   Clearly, the academic system falls short in producing speakers minimally qualified to hold jobs requiring the use of foreign language, which is why the federal language programs exist and why the language training business in the private sector is so successful.  
   The same report further explains that the language training business is estimated to be $20 billion internationally. That is money spent by our government, our businesses and individuals to teach adults a skill essential in the global relationships of industry, diplomacy, defense, and higher education. 
   The evidence of need is great, and yet there is a lack of sufficient foreign language training at the K-12 level. We have one program in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act aimed at providing incentives and giving grants to schools for this purpose. It is a program that is currently funded at just $5 million for a few matching grants in a handful of states. However, the section of this law providing a grant for schools that offer foreign language instruction programs has never been funded. A frustrating aspect of this good program is that the schools in the most need of the assistance can't afford the ante. My amendments establish a 50 percent set aside for schools serving the most disadvantaged students, and eliminates the matching share requirement for those schools. This bill also increases the annual authorization for the program from $55,000,000 to $75,000,000. 
   I hope that we will give greater attention to this program when we make funding decisions, so that schools without the advantages of plentiful resources can provide their students with a high quality and competitive education. 
   My amendments to the ESEA Foreign Language Assistance Program will provide new opportunities and encouragement to our school children, teachers, and parents, so we can better meet our global business challenges and national security needs.

    Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of the Senate the recent celebration of a special anniversary of one of our finest national treasures and most historic sites--the Vicksburg National Military Park. 
   On February 20, 1999, ceremonies were held at the Vicksburg National Military Park in Vicksburg, Mississippi, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the park. The statues of the first two superintendents of the park, Stephen D. Lee and William T. Rigby, were rededicated with several of their descendants in attendance. 
   This park was the seventh National Park established, and is the site of the campaign and siege of Vicksburg. On February 21, 1899, President William McKinley signed the legislation which created the park. Although originally envisioned to include 4,000 acres, today the park is comprised of over 1,800 acres with 1,324 monuments, markers and tablets. There are twenty-seven state monuments. In July of this year, the Kentucky monument will be dedicated.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to reauthorize the National Writing Project, the only Federal program to improve the teaching of writing in America's classrooms. 
   Literacy is at the foundation of school and workspace success, of citizenship in a democracy, and of learning in all disciplines. The National Writing Project has been instrumental in helping teachers develop better teaching skills so they can help our children improve their ability to read, write, and think. 
   As the United States continues to face a crisis in wiring in school heightened by the growing number of at-risk students due to limited English proficiency and the shortage of adequately trained teachers, continued Federal support for a program that works such as the National Writing Project is imperative. 
   The National Writing Project is a national network of university-based teacher training programs designed to improve the teaching of writing and student achievement in writing. 
   Through its professional development model, the National Writing Project recognizes the primary importance of teacher knowledge, expertise, and leadership. The National Writing Project operates on a teachers-teaching teachers model. Successful writing teachers attend Invitational Summer Institutes at their local universities. During the school year these teachers provide workshops for other teachers in the schools. 
   Teachers of all subjects benefit from the training, and the success of students who are taught by Writing Project teachers is evident: they score better not just on writing examinations, but in reading, mathematics, and in other subjects. 
   Since 1973, the National Writing Project has served over 1.8 million teaches and administrators. Each year over 150,000 participants benefit from the National Writing Project programs in 1 of 156 United States sites located in 46 States and Puerto Rico. The National Writing Project generates $6.47 for every Federal dollar. 
   I am pleased, that for the first time since the National Writing Project was authorized for federal funding in 1991, the President has requested funds to expand the National Writing Project in his budget for Fiscal Year 2000. 
   This program has proven to be one of the most effective in education today. I am proud to be associated with it, and I compliment those who have made it so successful across the nation. 
   When I first introduced this bill in 1990, it was cosponsored by 40 Senators, both Republicans and Democrats. I hope it will receive equal or greater support in the 106th Congress. I invite other Senators to join me in sponsoring this legislation.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. THURMOND, in cosponsoring his resolution expressing the gratitude of the Senate for the service of the Senate Legislative Counsel, Frank Burk. 
   Many people outside the Senate do not know the office of the Legislative Counsel even exists. However, the legislative business of the Senate could not be accomplished without the able assistance of the office of the Legislative Counsel. 
   A graduate of Dartmouth College and George Washington University Law School, Mr. Burk served as an Army officer in Korea. Mr. Burk has worked in the Legislative Counsel's office for more than 28 years, beginning as a law assistant in 1970 and rising to hold the office's top position, Legislative Counsel in 1991. 
   As many know, attorneys in the legislative counsel's office have specific areas of expertise and responsibility. For more than 25 years, Mr. Burk's responsibilities included banking, securities, transportation, housing and small business. After becoming Legislative Counsel, he assumed the duty of drafting legislation relating to the operations and rules of the Senate. 
   I am very pleased to join my colleagues today in expressing our gratitude and in extending our best wishes to Frank Burk.

   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce today we are introducing, again, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, a bill to make it the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, a system to defend the United States against limited ballistic missile attack. I am happy to be joined by my friend, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. INOUYE, in introducing this bill. And I am pleased that we have just heard that the Secretary of Defense has announced that funds will be included in this year's budget to pay for deployment of the National Missile Defense System, acknowledging that the threat does exist, or soon will. So the administration is changing its policy now, faced with this push that was begun in the last Congress and is culminating now in the reintroduction of this legislation. 
   Ballistic missiles are being developed and tested by a growing number of nations, some of which are hostile to the United States. 
   Iran has declared itself self-sufficient in missile technology and expertise. It is building a missile system capable of striking Central Europe. 
   Last year, North Korea surprised experts with its test of the Taepo Dong-1, a three-stage missile which, according to published reports, may be capable of reaching Alaska. Last July, the Rumsfeld Commission concluded that the United States may have ``little or no warning'' of the development of intercontinental ballistic missile capability by a rogue state. 
   The United States has no defense against long-range ballistic missiles, and administration policy had been limited to development of a missile defense system and deployment only if a threat developed. Now the threat has become obvious to the administration. 
   I welcome the announcement this morning by the Secretary of Defense that the administration is acknowledging the need to proceed with a program to develop a missile defense system to meet this threat and to deploy it. The time has come to remove all doubts about the resolve of the United States on this issue. The National Missile Defense Act of 1999 confirms this resolve as national policy.
