Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I begin by thanking my colleague from Louisiana Senator Breaux, a cosponsor on this measure, as well as Senator Murkowski, Senator Lott, Senator D'Amato, Senator Cleland, Senator Johnson, Senator Cochran, Senator Sessions and Senator Mikulski as cosponsors of this measure, and also thank the many leaders on the House side that are today introducing this bill on the House side. 
Surely, with the time so short, we will not be considering this bill in this session, but we plan for a very lively debate as the 106th Congress meets in January on this very important piece of environmental legislation for our country. 
I will take a few minutes to outline in a highlighted form what this bill will attempt to do, something that we have worked on, a group of us, earnestly and very excitedly for the last year. Then my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, will say a few words about the bill. 
This is the Reinvestment and Environmental Restoration Act of 1998. It is going to attempt to take 50 percent of the moneys that are now flowing into the Federal Treasury from offshore oil and gas revenues--which have been very significant; $120 billion since 1955--and redistribute those revenues in a smarter way, in a better way, and in a way that our country can be proud of. 
We are going to ask that 27 percent of those revenues be distributed to coastal States for coastal conservation impact assistance, 16 percent to fund more fully the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and 7 percent to fund the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Act. These are the major titles of this bill. Let me very briefly hit on each one. 
I am from Louisiana, a State that has supported, proudly supported, oil and gas drilling and exploration. It has created many jobs in our State. We try to do it in a more environmentally sensitive way each and every year, and every decade we make tremendous progress. Other States like Texas, Mississippi, and to a certain degree, Alabama, although not as much, and Alaska, join in that effort. 
There are many States that do not have drilling and many States that have a moratorium on drilling. This bill is not a pro-drilling bill or anti-drilling bill. The purpose is to say that the production of those resources off the shores of our States, although they are offshore, have tremendous impact--both positive and negative--on the States that host drilling. 
Louisiana has contributed since the 1950s over 90 percent of these revenues that I spoke about, the $120 billion, and we have gotten less than 1 percent back. It is time to correct that inequity. That is what the first title of this bill does. It says to Louisiana, thank you for your commitment to our energy security and for the way that you have contributed to this oil and gas drilling. We believe that some of this money should go back to help your State and the coastal areas to shore up our wetlands and to reinvest in our environment. That is Title I of this bill. It will distribute funds to all coastal States, whether they have drilling or not. 
As I said, there are no incentives; there are no disincentives. It is a revenue-sharing bill to all the coastal States. These revenues are collected from a nonrenewable resource. One day these oil and gas wells will be dried up. It might be 10 years from now or 20 years from now, but some day they will be dried up, and we want to make sure that a portion of this money is reinvested back into our States for environmental infrastructure and wetland conservation so that we have something to show for it.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, after two and a half months of debate on the economic and disaster crisis facing rural America and thousands of farm families, we are voting on a measure that provides $4.2 billion in economic relief to our farmers. 
During the course of this debate, we have heard from our Democratic Leader, who I want to commend for his leadership on this issue, our President, and many others who believe that much more assistance is needed to adequately address the serious situation facing rural America. I fully agree that the relief provided in this legislation is far less than meaningful for Louisiana and other Southern states who are suffering one of the worst droughts in 100 years. Already, we have thousands of farmers whose crops and pasture land have been burnt up by the heat and an estimated $450 million in crop losses in Louisiana alone. These same farmers are also facing some of the worst commodity prices in over a decade. Not only are Louisiana farmers hit with low prices, they also have no crop. Therefore, I have argued and strongly supported additional funding to address this crisis. This funding is justified and should be provided. 
However, Mr. President, we also have a conference report before us, a bill that provides a total of $55.7 billion in essential funding for some very important agriculture, rural development, and nutrition programs. Additionally, included in this measure is over $25 million for much needed research and education projects in Louisiana. 
Mr. President, the senior Senator from Louisiana and I have both advocated for additional funding for our farmers. However, the bottom line is that many members in the House and Senate have differing views about how this assistance should be delivered. Furthermore, many members have strong philosophical reasons for opposing even the $4.2 billion provided in this relief package. Therefore, with only a few days remaining, before the Congress adjourns and the $450 million in associated crop damages facing Louisiana, the $4.2 billion provided in this legislation, is the best option on the table for providing immediate assistance to my state. Therefore, I am rising in support of this measure, which as stated by the Chairman and Senator Bumpers has been one of the most difficult conference reports ever considered by the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. 
Mr. President, before I conclude my remarks I want to make two additional points. While I recognize that this is not the appropriate bill to reform crop insurance, I want to make a prediction that if this issue along with revisions to the current loan rate structure are not addressed early next year, we will be back on the Senate floor debating an even greater economic farm crisis. Then, we will not only be hearing from farmers, but bankers, retail store owners and state chambers of commerce. 
I know that many of my colleagues strongly support crop insurance reform. However, many Senators are opposed to revisiting any of the loan rate provisions included in the 1996 Farm Bill. From my discussions with several reputable farmers in Louisiana this issue should be reconsidered. 
Mr. President, with the many complicated issues facing farmers, only through a bipartisan effort can we begin to address these matters. Therefore, I hope that the Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate will take the additional steps needed early next year to address and resolve this pending economic agriculture crisis. 
I thank the Chairman for yielding his time and I yield the floor.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate adopted the conference report on H.R. 4103, the Department of Defense Appropriations bill. I wanted to take this opportunity to discuss a relatively small part of this budget which has a huge impact on my state. 
Outside of the City of New Orleans, we have one of the few remaining shipyards in the country that still builds ocean-going ships for the Navy. Avondale Shipyards is a key employer in the area. With over 5,000 working men and women, it is the largest private employer in the region. Louisiana has a proud maritime tradition, and has a particular expertise in ship building. As a shipyard of tremendous capacity and infrastructure, and the host of the Maritime Excellence Center, Avondale has played an important part in the development of this industry. 
However, Avondale has also maintained a record of labor relations which Judge Evans of the National Labor Relations Board termed `outrageous and pervasive.' This is not the image of Louisiana's growing maritime industry that I want projected. I believe that Louisiana should be the world leader in shipbuilding, but I also believe that we cannot attain that status through substandard wages and unsafe working conditions. Many manufacturing sectors in our country have been faced with international competition that created difficult times. The way these industries rebounded was not to turn back the clock on progress made in working conditions and wages. Instead, our industrial sector did just the opposite: they grew more hi-tech and more specialized; they invested in their workers, and they invested in new technologies. This is the only route to true success and leadership. Louisiana's shipyards will never be able to compete with countries like China and the Phillippines on the basis of wages--the key is to concentrate on American strengths: technology, craftsmanship and quality. 
That is my goal for Avondale. To help them become a world leader, and transition away from practices which threaten that objective. The seemingly endless dispute between management and labor at Avondale is a huge impediment to the process. I am ready to work with anyone who in good faith seeks to resolve the problem. In this spirit, I have talked to the Navy about Avondale and inquired about the significance of labor relations in Navy contracts. Let me be clear, I did not make these inquires to block contracts from being awarded to Avondale. It benefits no one to have workers loose their jobs and the state diminish its industrial base in order to make a point. This is especially true when we should have a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision on the union election in the near future. 
I voted for the Defense Appropriations bill, because I believe in a strong defense. I also voted for the Defense Appropriations bill because I believe in a strong Avondale. The government provides over eighty percent of Avondale's contracts. The shipyard cannot function without them. I have no intention of jeopardizing Avondale's future. My sole objective is to facilitate my state's future success in the maritime field. Avondale must be part of that success. This long-standing labor dispute should be resolved at the earliest possible time to achieve that end.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, over the past several weeks the senior Senator from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, and I have expressed grave concerns about the pending economic crisis that Louisiana and other Southern states face as a result of the worst drought in Louisiana and the South's history. Earlier this week, more disturbing information was brought to our attention by Terry Smith, a second generation farmer, cotton gin manager and marketing consultant from Jonesville, Louisiana who testified before a hearing called by Senator Daschle on the farm crisis. The plea by Mr. Smith and others in Louisiana is a wake up call. If the Congress fails to respond to the natural disaster crisis in the South for this crop year, not only will farmers be forced into bankruptcy, but banks, hundreds of small businesses and the rural economy that is supported by the agriculture industry will suffer greatly. 
Mr. President, Louisiana began the year with record rainfall during the Winter and early Spring followed by the hottest Summer on record. Just during the last three months, Louisiana has had 71 days of 97 degree or higher temperatures with 36 days higher than 100 degrees. Things are not looking any better and we are told that with the past and current extreme weather conditions the current loss estimates of $450 million are expected to increase even more during the coming weeks. This is not good news especially for Louisiana corn, cotton, soybean and livestock producers in North Louisiana who have been hit hardest. 
To explain the difficulties that Louisiana farmers are experiencing I would like to take a few moments to highlight some of the high points of Terry's remarks. His recent statement very clearly tells the story of the projected impact this natural disaster has had on thousands of family farms and the future economy of some of the poorest areas in Louisiana. Specifically, his testimony focuses on the economic losses projected for Louisiana's major row crops--corn, cotton and soybeans. 
Mr. President, corn farmers in Louisiana under normal weather patterns are able to produce about 100-200 bushels per acre for non-irrigated corn. To date, the best corn yields in Louisiana have been in the 40-50 bushel per acre range. In addition, a large percentage of Louisiana's corn crop is infested with aflatoxin, a toxic mold that results from heat stress and is harmful to humans and animals at certain levels. Due to the toxic nature of this mold, corn harvested with aflatoxin in excess of 20 parts per billion can not be sold to most grain elevators. The grain elevators that will except infested corn is only paying $1.00 per bushel--less than half of what is needed to cover the farmer's production costs. Therefore, the farmer has two options--(1) sell the crop at discounted price of $1.00 an acre or (2) leave it in the field to rot and collect about the same amount, if the farmer has Catastrophic Crop Insurance. Most farmers with aflatoxin in their corn above 20 billion parts per million are finding it unpractical to even harvest. Those farmers who are lucky enough to have corn without aflatoxin will not be able to cover even half of their production costs due to low yields and low prices. What is the result of this situation? The Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service recently estimated that corn farmers in one North Louisiana Parish will lose about $154 per acre or about $3.85 million this year. 
Our cotton farmers just began their harvest last week, but the outlook is not much better. Cotton yields in Louisiana generally average about 800 to 1000 pounds per acre. As of last week, cotton yields have been averaging 100 to 650 pounds per acre, one third to one half of normal production yields. Also, the quality has been extremely poor due to the hot dry summer and will discount the price the farmer gets for his crop by several cents per pound. With production costs of cotton in Louisiana ranging from $500 to $600 per acre, it is estimated that the average cotton farmer will lose approximately $131,000 this year. 
Soybean harvest has also just begun. Yields thus far are less than 10 bushels per acre, which is down approximately 65% from normal. Most fields in North Louisiana are averaging about 4-5 bushels per acre. Also, because of the hot, dry weather, chemicals have not been preforming and weeds have been a tremendous problem. With the extreme low prices of soybeans and low yields, farmers in hardest hit areas can expect to lose approximately $85 per acre or about $42,500 this year. 
These are just a few examples of how the major row crops will be impacted. In addition, our larger agriculture lending institutions are expecting very low repayments this year. One of the larger banks in the state says that of $18 million in crop loans, they are expecting to be repaid only 30-35% of the outstanding loans. Another bank expects that 40-50% of the agricultural loans will not be totally paid this year. Not only will crop loans not be repaid, but outstanding bills for crop inputs such as chemicals, fertilizer and fuel may not be paid in full. In the words of one banker `spendable income will be down 75% of normal. This is the money used to buy clothing, household goods and for paying the utilities.' 
Mr. President, these are real examples of the economic hardships facing farmers, their families and the rural communities they support. Many farm families do not know what they are going to do in order to make it another year. Many may end up in the local unemployment office. I hope that this Congress does not let this happen. 
Farmers in Louisiana and other Southern states need disaster assistance, and they need it before the Congress adjourns. They need this assistance delivered in a manner that is fair. Thus, this relief should only be provided to those farmers with demonstrated crop losses. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support of direct disaster payments to the thousands of farmers who provide us with three square meals a day. This source is so often taken for granted every day when we feed our families. 
Mr. President, before I conclude my remarks, I would like to talk about some specific relief measures needed to address the 1998 crop losses in Louisiana and other Southern states that have lost a large portion of their crops due to the drought and associated disease. These measures include: 
1. The Secretary should deliver direct disaster payments to compensate all farmers for 1998 crop losses through the Farm Service Agency (FSA). 
2. Payments should be based on actual farm yields using the past five years of actual production history, excluding the crop year with the lowest yields per harvested acre and any crop year in which the crop was not planted on the farm. Actual production losses should be adjusted because of quality losses caused by damaging weather and related conditions, including diseases such as aflatoxin. If no five year history is available, the Secretary should use the average county yields. 
3. With respect to livestock producers, direct payments should cover the cost of feed, the establishment of supplemental pastures and other losses due to natural disasters, including livestock and poultry weight losses, poultry mortality and livestock milk production losses. 
4. With respect to tree farmers, direct payments should cover the cost of replanting seedlings and cover production costs of pecan and peach farmers who suffered losses due to a natural disaster during the 1998 crop year. 
5. Presently, any farmer who collected a Catastrophic Crop Insurance Payment (CAT) or Non-Insured Crop Insurance Payment (NAP) is ineligible for a low-interest Emergency Loan. This should be amended. 
6. Also, there is presently a seven year limit on the amount of credit that can be extended through the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA). On an emergency basis, the Secretary of Agriculture should be granted the authority to waive the current limitation. 
7. Finally, Mr. President, all the farmers that I have spoken with tell me the crop insurance program is not working. I think we do have some serious problems that can not be addressed in three weeks and should be revisited next year. However, one valid problem that can be addressed this year is to require USDA not to exclude from coverage approved existing planting methods. Currently, all broadcast soybeans planted in Louisiana are ineligible for crop insurance coverage due to the fact that they are seeded by broadcasting means such as aerial application. This is wrong and should be amended.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I say to my wonderful colleague from Arkansas before I get into the substance of my remarks, I have tremendous respect for him for his tremendous fight over such a long period of time on issues like this. Yesterday, we were together in our arguments because we have very similar feelings, which I think is shared by many in this body, about paying the taxpayer their fair share when it comes to minerals. I say to Senator Bumpers, he is going to be missed. I am going to pick up the fight, as I told him before, on hard rock mining, but there are some big differences between what we talked about on mining yesterday and what we are speaking about today. 
One of those big differences is in hard rock mining there are no royalties paid. It is a system that cries out for reform and change. In this instance--and I know you say, `Well, there is Landrieu; she's from an oil and gas State. We knew she was going to say this.' Trust me, when this issue first came up, I didn't know what I was going to say, for a number of reasons. Maybe I should say something about that first. 
Before you came here, you were a Governor, but I was a State treasurer and I managed a billion dollars that came from the Outer Continental Shelf. Because we are a poor State, because we haven't managed our resources as well as we could have in the past, and because of other issues--we didn't have computers in the classrooms--I managed that money more carefully than I manage my own. It came from these royalties, and I treasured every single penny, because with every dime, we could then hire a new teacher or put a computer in a classroom or buy software for kids. I am there with you on that 100 percent. We had that billion dollars, and it is growing every day and we are happy for it in Louisiana. 
I believe as deeply as I can express that we want the taxpayers to receive their absolute fair share to the penny because these dollars can be put to good use, and I hope they will be put to better use, because the other point I want to make is I am getting ready to introduce--I hope with Senator Bumpers and others and Senator Hutchison from Texas--a bill that will help redistribute these royalties that we get and have been getting since 1955 to the tune of $120 billion, which the Federal Government has received from these royalties; to redistribute it in a better way; to invest it in our environment; to invest it in the expansion of our national parks; to invest it for the expansion of our urban parks; to prevent species from becoming endangered, a real investment in our environment, a real payback in the right and noble sense to the taxpayer. 
I am 100 percent on the record for just royalties being paid, for substantial royalties being paid when appropriate, so I don't want there to be a question--and I so much respect the Senator for his fight--but this issue is about really litigation and lawsuits and unclear regulations. It is not necessarily an environmental or antienvironmental issue, and it shouldn't be a drilling or a nondrilling issue. 
It is about whether we should adopt a rule that is either going to stop the litigation, or we are going to adopt this new rule that isn't going to stop the litigation. The rule that we have to consider for which we are now asking for a suspension is not going to do anything, as much respect as I have for Senator Boxer, in stopping the litigation. 
To put this in perspective, let me say to my colleagues that last year, Minerals Management Service received $6 billion from royalties. At issue here is $66 million, which is less than 1 percent of the total. This isn't about oil companies not wanting to pay royalties. I say to the distinguished Senator from California, they sent to the Federal Treasury $6 billion last year, and the year before it was $4 billion, and since 1955 it has been $120 billion. They are not opposed to sending their fair share, but because the regulations are complicated, they are difficult--the oil industry is reorganizing itself, driven by technology and the pressures--may I have 2 more minutes?

Ms. LANDRIEU. The oil industry is reorganizing itself in such a way that all it is asking for, I say to the Senator from California and others, is a fair rule that is clearly understood so that they can pay their fair share, get out of the courtrooms, cut their cost of their lawyers and accountants, pay the taxpayers their fair share, and get on with their business. 
It is in nobody's interest for this to continue in this way--not for business, not for jobs, not for the taxpayer. That is what this argument is about, with all due respect to everyone who has said, I think, very tough things about oil companies wanting to cheat. 
Most of the oil companies I know do not want to cheat. Most of the oil companies are happy to pay their tab, they just would like a clear signal about what tab it is that they owe. And they do not want to spend their time in court. 
I am afraid if we let this rule go through, we are going to spend more time in court, waste more taxpayer money and not move us 5 feet down the ballfield on this subject. So that is why I am opposing Senator Boxer's amendment and supporting to give us additional time to work out some language so that everybody can pay their fair share, and the taxpayers can benefit, and we can all get out of the courtrooms and get on to running our businesses. 
Thank you so much. 
Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague from Arkansas to add just a moment of my thoughts to the tremendous argument he has made to strike this language from the Interior appropriations bill and to try to move us on in a path of real reform on this issue, reform that is so long overdue. Since 1971, attempt after attempt after attempt has been made, either to pass laws to reform the 1872 statute--attempts that have failed because there is not enough support--or we have tried to take some steps through regulations. Yet delay after delay after delay has taken place.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, two months ago, I joined my colleagues in requesting assistance for our Nation's farmers in Louisiana and other parts of the Nation who are on the brink of bankruptcy. Not because they are bad farmers but as a result of natural disasters and prices that they cannot control. 
In Louisiana, farmers are experiencing the most severe agriculture disaster it has been subjected to in the last 100 years. The Louisiana State University (LSU) Agricultural Center has estimated crop losses at $391 million. When losses due to aflatoxin in corn and livestock losses are added, the State is projecting escalated losses of $450 million. If no effective disaster relief is provided, Louisiana will lose 35-40 percent of its farmers. Without these farmers the State projects that its economy will lose an additional $1 billion. 
Mr. President, this is a very serious situation, one that warrants an effective solution for the disaster situation facing the South and the income losses facing the Midwest. For Louisiana, relief needed is twofold: One, production loss related to the drought and heat and two, economic. For other areas, income loss assistance needed is different. 
The major problem in providing equitable relief is that while the Midwest has bumper crops and no price, the South has no crops and no price. Therefore, I am very concerned that while this amendment will provide help to some, it does not go near far enough to ensure that Louisiana farmers are provided the emergency disaster assistance that they need to make it another year. 
For example, under the current legislation being debated a corn farmer in the Midwest who produces a normal yield of 120 bushels per acre under a loan rate of 30 cents per bushel would receive a Loan Deficiency Payment (LDP) of $36 per acre. In the South, a corn farmer who produced only 50 bushels per acre, due to the drought, under the same loan rate would only receive a LDP of $15 per acre. A corn farmer in the South whose corn had to be destroyed due to aflatoxin would receive no LDP whatsoever. 
The bottom line is that higher loan rates only benefit producers on actual production sold. The only way higher loan rates would benefit producers whose production was substantially reduced would be to make an economic payment on the lost production in addition to the bushels harvested. Therefore, while this may help farmers in the Midwest, it provides little to no assistance to farmers in the South. 
The other provision in the underlying amendment that may be more helpful in providing disaster assistance to Louisiana is the $1.5 billion included in the amendment to replenish the national disaster reserve. However, the details in how USDA would implement this measure to provide disaster assistance to farmers with only one year losses, such as in the case of Louisiana, is unclear. 
As I have previously stated, the reasons for the income loss related problems facing farmers in Louisiana and other parts of the U.S. are quite different, but the results are the same. Only through direct assistance, can Louisiana farmers be helped. 
For Louisiana and other Southern States, many farmers will not see next year and grow the crops that provide Americans with the safest food supply in the world. Time and time again, when a natural disaster has struck, the Congress has provided the help needed to rebuild our cities and towns. Should we provide help to family farms that are facing an economic disaster beyond their control? Absolutely. It is now time that the Congress work on the bipartisan basis to provide direct financial assistance to our farmers just like we provide assistance to other individuals who have faced disasters beyond their control. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me and my senior colleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, in working to ensure this assistance is provided fairly to all farmers, including farmers in Louisiana and the South.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me join my distinguished colleague from New Jersey in thanking our distinguished colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, for bringing this issue to the floor today for comments. In addition, let me thank Senator Craig and Senator Graham for their sponsorship of this bill. I wanted to add a few words, because this has been said so eloquently by these two Senators before me, but I would only add just a few thoughts. 
We celebrate many things in America. We have many special days to commemorate many special individuals and events. We have many months that we set aside to celebrate all sorts of things that are important. This particular 30-day period from September 15 to October 15 is important because it recognizes the Hispanic community and allows us to celebrate together the great contributions that Hispanic-Americans have made to our country as a group and as individuals. They have made valuable contributions decade after decade and century after century, from explorers to pioneers to inventors to entrepreneurs to statesmen and stateswomen who have served our country so admirably. It would take me all day--all year--to stand up and enumerate all the many contributions. But that is what this month is about, to take a moment to recognize the great strengths that the Hispanic community brings to America. It's also to recognize that is in fact what makes our country so different, what makes it uniquely admirable, what makes it the strongest country in the world. It is our diversity and our respect for diversity that makes us so different. 
In that light, we could give many emotional and moving speeches about these individuals and communities. But I frankly think, as one Senator, that actions speak louder than words. 
One thing that we could do to take specific action that could express in no uncertain terms our acknowledgment of these contributions, our gratitude toward the Hispanic community, our acknowledgment that we all share responsibilities, obligations and duties equally to make this country strong and also to equally enjoy the protections of our Constitution and what our flag represents than to let Puerto Rico decide it's own political future. There would be no greater, or better, or more appropriate action than to pass the Craig-Graham bill for the status of Puerto Rico, to allow the people to make a choice between either commonwealth or statehood or independence; but, Mr. President, to allow them, when they make that choice, to know the details of what each of those choices will actually mean, to not be unclear. 
So this is something we have to do together. The people of Puerto Rico have to vote. But this Congress--and the House has already recognized this by a vote of only one, but still a decisive victory, a victory in the House--must recognize that only those efforts are not enough for the people of Puerto Rico, but we have to act to have a bill with the definitions of commonwealth and statehood and independence, so the consequences of their choices would be clear to them and to us and to all the people that we represent. That is why it is important for this bill to pass, regardless of individual Members' feelings about what the outcome should be. Passing this bill would be the best action we could take. 
I know my constituents are well aware that the 4 million citizens in Puerto Rico do not enjoy the right to vote in Presidential elections, although they do share the obligation of military service and the draft. They do not pay income tax, but they do pay other obligations. The situation needs to be clarified. We can do that by passing this bill and giving them a chance to vote so their responsibilities and duties and protections can become more equal in their alignment. 
Finally, I reiterate that this group of patriots from Puerto Rico have fought and died for the United States in wars beginning, not just a few years ago, but since the Revolutionary War. For Louisiana it is especially significant, for our first Governor, Bernardo de Galvez, led soldiers that included men from Puerto Rico in an effort to thwart the British in the territory of Florida, which extended from the State of my distinguished colleague, Senator Graham of Florida, all the way to what is now Louisiana and the territory and State which we know in present day as Louisiana. So for our State there is a particular, emotional, long-standing attachment to this issue. 
With all of what my colleagues have said--and I reiterate, we can give all the great speeches we want, but actions speak louder than words--in light of that, the truth of that, in the light of fairness and what is appropriate, I urge my colleagues to take this month to do something meaningful and real, something more than words, that could have a lasting effect on millions of Puerto Ricans and Americans, and the strength of our country.

 Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I note with sadness the passing of a leading citizen of my hometown, New Orleans, Louisiana. Carolyn Gay Labouisse, a community leader and civic activist for many decades, died this past weekend at the age of 83. She was the daughter of Edward James Gay, a Senator from Louisiana from 1918 until 1921. 
Known to everyone as `Blondie,' she was the classic Southern woman who, when she saw something lacking in the community, would immediately step forward, roll up her sleeves, and set about making things right. For example, when she saw that New Orleans had an inadequate, out-of-date library facility, she immediately began to spearhead efforts to build a new, modern Main Library. She also worked to develop and expand public affairs programming at our local public television station (WYES). She was an active participant in several task force committees dealing with education in New Orleans. 
Blondie was dedicated to progressive politics. In the 1940's and 1950's, she was part of a circle of young people in New Orleans who fought hard to eliminate corruption from politics and to make state and local government more responsive to the needs of its citizens. She campaigned to elect reform candidates as governor of Louisiana and mayor of New Orleans. She was one of the founding members of the Independent Women's Organization, which is a leading reform organization in New Orleans. 
She received the 1991 Times-Picayune Loving Cup, the single most prestigious award given annually in New Orleans for community service. The selection committee, in recommending her, noted that `few show more care and compassion for community and fellow man.' 
I extend my sympathies to her family. Blondie Labouisse meant a great deal to the people of New Orleans. She will be missed.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleague in thanking the Subcommittee for its action last year in providing funding for this vital initiative. I fully agree with my distinguished colleague that the completion of the new communications system for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office is a high priority project that deserves funding under the FY 1999 COPS Technology Grant Program. The Sheriff's Department has committed to at least a 50-50 cost share with the federal government for this initiative which can serve as a national model. Further, the new communications system will help meet a clear public safety need by supporting interoperability and thus enhancing communication between the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Department and a number of other local and national law enforcement and public safety agencies throughout the region. This interoperability will enhance the Sheriff's Department's effectiveness in combating crime and responding to area-wide public safety emergencies. 
I would also like to add that funding is needed in order for the Sheriff's Office to meet FCC requirements and the procurement implementation schedule for the new system.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand that the amendment by my distinguished colleague, Mr. Wellstone, has been accepted. I wanted to say how much I admire him for bringing this issue to the attention of the Senate and for his eloquent presentation on what I think is a real problem in our Nation. As he outlined, in Louisiana, during his last visit, he found that one of our facilities sure could stand great improvement. I am also positive that there are many facilities in other States in our Nation that can also use improvement and attention. 
I wanted to say for the Record that we talk, in campaigns particularly and finally when we get here to this body, a lot about being `tough on crime.' We talk about being smart and tough because it takes a combination of that to really drive down these juvenile crime rates, drive down crime rates in America. We need to remain tough, with tough penalties; but we also have to be smart. This was a smart amendment that we accepted just a few minutes ago. This was maybe one of the smartest things we have done in a couple of weeks here--and maybe for a long time --because we have allowed States to take some of their money for construction and use it for mental health services. 
It does us no good, Mr. President, as we know, to keep juveniles in facilities that are inappropriate and don't offer the proper training and counseling, only to turn them into hardened criminals--for them to then be released to go back into our neighborhoods and communities and wreak havoc when we could have done the smart thing, which Senator Wellstone has urged us to do, and what we have now done, by intervening earlier and providing this counseling, which would prevent us from spending extra money. But it is not just the extra money that we spend, it is also the loss of life, the loss of property, the pain and suffering that is caused when we don't do these things early on. So spending a small amount of money for the proper mental health counseling would go a long way, I think, in our Nation toward getting us to our goal of reducing crime across the board in America. 
I want to thank the Senator for his visit to Louisiana. I am familiar with this facility. I had some dealings with this and three other facilities when I was State treasurer in Louisiana. At that time, many years ago, I objected to the construction of these facilities based on the thought that it was profits driving them and not good policies about how to incarcerate, when to incarcerate, and what kind of counseling these juveniles would get. Sometimes they are first offenders, sometimes they are nonviolent offenders. The lack of those services has provided a prospective. I did not prevail, obviously, because these facilities were built. We can clearly see now that there are problems when our policies are driven by profits, not good crime-fighting policies and good prevention. I am thankful and glad that we adopted this amendment. I want to voice my support for what we are doing. Hopefully, we can do more of it.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank our leader for yielding time to me. 
I wanted to speak earlier for the Record to give my distinguished colleague from Iowa some words from Louisiana. We talk a lot about the Midwest and the Northwest, and the difficulty that our farmers are experiencing, actually all over our country. And the South, Mr. President, is no different. 
I had a very lengthy conference call with the leaders of many of our commodity groups. I am sorry to bring to this floor that the situation is fairly urgent in Louisiana. I am sure that is true in other places in the South. They are facing economic hardships, unparalleled in many instances. In fact, I asked Ken Methavin, one of our cotton producers from Natchitoches, LA, if he could describe the situation. He said, `Ms. Landrieu, there ain't nobody alive that has ever seen anything like this for a hundred years.' We are experiencing in Louisiana a 100-year drought, and for us with usually an ample supply of water it is hard for me even to be able to speak here about the situation that the farmers are experiencing. It is very unusual. 
Over the past 3 and a half months, our State has received virtually no measurable rainfall in the crop-growing regions of the State. As of this week, the average rainfall totaled 13 inches below our State average. 
In addition to facing one of the worst droughts in our history, the State is experiencing very high temperatures, over 100 degrees. The combination has resulted in extensive damage to our corn crop. 
Our soybean farmers, in addition, tell me that about a third of their crop will be in jeopardy. 
Our dairy farmers continue to face not only the weather conditions--the lack of water and the high temperatures--but depressed prices are also driving many of them out of business. Milk production has decreased more than 50 percent, in addition, due to damaged pastureland. 
Our cotton and rice farmers are also expecting to suffer from the drought. In addition, the Asian financial crisis, which has not yet completely hit, threatens to further complicate the situation. 
Our forest production report is equally disturbing. We planted 100 million seedlings this last year and to date have lost over 50 million, and 15,000 acres of forest in Louisiana have burned, resulting in fire not to be compared to what is happening in Florida, but still a significant amount of acres has been lost. 
In parish after parish, I am hearing nothing but grim news about the impact of the drought on depressed prices in some areas, and the extreme heat. I am told that even with crop insurance under the current Crop Insurance Program, many of our farmers will not be able to recoup any measurable portion of their input costs. Other farmers who are not eligible for crop insurance have no similar assistance at all to avail themselves of. 
So I am pleased to be here today on the floor to join our leader, Senator Daschle, in his plea--his urgent plea--for this Congress to come together and to give appropriate assurance and appropriate measures to our farmers at this time. It is not enough, Mr. President, I don't think, to pass a sense of the Senate. What is appropriate is to give meaning to that resolution that we passed yesterday. We should have specific, concrete relief and a safety net for our farmers to get them through a difficult time and to realize that perhaps the laws that we have outlined are not perfect and could be improved with some changes that our leader has put forward. 
So I am happy to join him today, and Senator Harkin, to continue to fight and to support our farmers not only in Louisiana but around the Nation. 
Thank you, and I yield the remainder of my time. 
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I have not often found myself at odds with my distinguished colleague from Vermont whom I have come to respect and admire a great deal in every aspect of his work. But I do rise in support of this bill, in opposition to the comments made by the distinguished Senator from Vermont. 
I will, however, agree with him on one point, and that is we most certainly need to have our positions in our Federal courts filled in a timely manner. This is not the only issue in our country that needs attention. This is not the only issue where people, individuals and parties, are aggrieved and need their grievances remedied in a timely manner. So I do join him and thank him for his valiant efforts to try to get the nominations of many qualified individuals, nominated for our Federal bench, certified and voted on so that these matters can be handled in a more timely fashion. 
But I am pleased to rise in support of S. 2271, to join my distinguished colleagues from Utah and Georgia. The reason I rise to support this bill is because this is about fairness. It is about access to justice for the rich and for the poor, for people who have a lot of property, for people who have little property. In fact, this is a bill for people who don't own any property yet, but one day hope or dream or have planned or have saved, or perhaps inherit some property, perhaps the first ever owned in generations in their family, from having their rights of ownership trampled on. It is what I think the Democratic Party is about. It is why I am a Democrat. It is about the fundamental principles that the Democratic Party of which I am so proud stands for, and which I have spent, as have many on our side, a great deal of our lives and our political careers--fighting for the principles of these cornerstones of fairness and justice. 
I know my distinguished colleague pointed out corporate America. I am not sure exactly this is the picture he had in mind, because this is a picture, here, of Ann and Richard Reahard from Lee County, FL. I don't--perhaps he does, but I don't--see a corporate headquarters here in this picture or cell phones or limousines or Christian Dior suits. I just see two people who look like they love each other and have worked hard. They inherited 40 acres of land in Florida. 
I will not go through all the heartache that is listed here, but the point is, this is not corporate America. These are two people from Florida who inherited some land, and because of the lack of clearness in this law, in this unconstitutional law, have literally lived a nightmare since 1984, even with the most reasonable suggestions made to this county about what to do to develop their property. 
But the point is, this is not about the rich. This is, in fact, about the poor and the rich, and about people who have property and people who one day hope to. This bill is not just important because it promotes these worthy goals. It is important because it provides practical relief for the small landowners of Louisiana and across the country. 
Opponents of this legislation assert that the bill will only help large developers and will put small localities at a disadvantage. To view S. 2271 that way is to actually put this situation on its head. Large land developers do not need our help to enforce their rights. They are the only plaintiffs that can actually afford to go all the way through the State court and then to Federal court, 
because under the current situation, you need to have plenty money, plenty time and plenty patience. 
Even so, large developers are not likely to be the people bringing these cases. If you are a development corporation with a half dozen projects in a certain area, what sense does it make for you to aggravate the local authorities by challenging their decision in Federal court? None, because it makes no sense. 
This bill is not about corporate America, large landowners, rich lawyers. Its much more likely scenario is a large developer will use its economic power and leverage to sail through the approval process, as complicated as it is, free from any trouble from local authorities, and they often do. The people who need this bill are private landowners, small business persons, small landowners who don't have a lot of money, who don't have economic clout, who can't hire a 100-person law firm to defend their rights in court and who don't have the resources that are at the disposal of some of our large developers. 
If your greatest asset is your home--and that is the greatest asset of the vast majority of people in our country who own nothing else; if they own something, they own their home and their land--they simply don't have the resources necessary to defend their constitutional rights against a local, State or Federal agency determined to delay and wait out your court claim. 
That is why I assert that this bill is about fairness. We change no substantive law under the fifth amendment. You have the same rights today as you will have when this bill passes. They will, however, be more clear. The change occurs with respect to the process by which you can enforce those rights. As it stands now, if I am a small property owner and I believe my land has been taken, I will be forced into a morass of administrative and legal procedures which studies show will take on the average of 9 1/2 years. 
Let me repeat that: 9 1/2 years to be resolved; not 3 months, not 6 months, not 2 years. There are not too many people who can afford an attorney for several months, let alone for 9 years. If you are a multimillion-dollar development corporation, you can afford to wait, but if you are a family building a business for the first time or building your first family home, you will be financially ruined in that amount of time. 
Which brings us to the second principle upheld by this legislation: access to justice. A 1997 study by Linowes and Blocher showed that even if you had spent the necessary time and money to go to local hearings and State court, in 81 percent of the cases brought to Federal court, the judges will still decline to hear the case on procedural grounds. In 81 percent of the cases they are being declined, not on the merits or the substance of their claim, but on procedural cases because the laws are so unclear in the jurisprudence, and that is what we are hoping to remedy today. Essentially, property owners have a constitutional right which they have no practical way of exercising. 
Everyone, Madam President, is entitled to their day in court. I strongly support access to the courts for environmental concerns. I support municipalities who use the courts to enforce their zoning ordinances. But it would be hypocritical of me, I say to my colleagues, to turn my back on the other side of the argument and allow property owners to go without any remedy for their legitimate complaints. 
Small property owners and large municipal governments, county governments and State governments--everyone--needs to have their day in court, and that is what this bill does, nothing more, nothing less. 
The central principle which underlies this bill is that we do not have a two-tiered system of constitutional rights. Chief Justice Rehnquist stated that the fifth amendment should not be the forgotten stepchild of the Bill of Rights. However, that is precisely the situation we confront. 
Under the fifth amendment, it states that private property shall not be taken for a public purpose without just compensation. To repeat: The fifth amendment says that private property shall not be taken for public use without a just compensation. 
Nevertheless, we have inadvertently, I believe, constructed a system which precludes the vast majority of people from ever seeing the inside of a Federal court to defend their rights and to give meaning to these words. They are actually useless without proper procedures to allow someone to state their claim. 
The free enjoyment of property is not only enshrined in the Constitution, it was one of the core motivations of our American Revolution. The difficulty is that while we have created a national right, the essence of land use and decisions are local, as they should be. For that reason, we have worked very hard to craft a bill which addresses the problems of property owners while maintaining the local decisionmaking structures. 
This bill does not affect--although the opponents have said it from day one--it does not affect local zoning. It grants no new rights. It preserves the authority of zoning boards and city councils. Specifically, I point to page 16, lines 1 through 4 that establish clearly in this bill that no one is entitled, when this bill passes, to challenge the authority of a local government to set local zoning ordinances as enabled by their State constitution or State laws or the laws of their territory. I want to be very clear, because the opponents have argued that this upsets local zoning laws, and it does not. 
In short, this is no overarching bill which will change land use laws. Rather, we will provide a chance for people who have real grievances to get their day in court in a timely manner. 
This bill, in fact, Madam President, reminds me a great deal of the IRS reform bill, which this body just passed 98 to 2. When you put all the cards in the hands of an administrative agency, you ensure abuse. That is what is occurring in these land use cases today. 
If you had read the horror stories that I have, you would feel the same outrage that compelled this Chamber to pass the IRS reform bill nearly unanimously. 
From my own State, let me just share one of these stories. Dean and Rita Beard of Lafitte broke ground 2 years ago. They began building their dream home. They put all their savings into it and picked out a spot that had been pastureland for more than 100 years. The Beards hoped to turn this property over to their children and their grandchildren. 
What ensued, however, was their worst nightmare, as the Army Corps of Engineers put their dream on hold by taking 10 acres of land for mitigation projects due to projects elsewhere. Now the nearly completed home of the Beards, which they were ready to enter, sits as a monument to the failure of our land use process. 
The Beards' attorney advises them it may be 10 years before this issue is resolved. They may have a case, they may have a claim, they may have been harmed, but it will take them 10 years because of the complications of when the administrative decision is final is not clear. 
In the meantime, they have invested their life savings into an unusable home and every extra penny has gone towards lawyers. I doubt after 9 years they will have, considering their situation, any money left. 
That, Madam President, is what this bill is trying to address. It is not going to say how the courts should rule, it is just to say that this family, who built their dream home in hopes of turning it over to their children and grandchildren, can get their day in court more quickly after exhausting their local remedies. 
This bill is important to the Beards, it is important to my State, it is important to the implementation of our Constitution. I hope my colleagues will take a close look--I know this vote is going to be very close today--I hope that they will take a close look at what is actually in this bill to see past the outlandish rhetoric thrown about by its opponents. 
Should this bill pass, it will not be a panacea to all the problems and regulations faced by landowners and the difficulties faced by municipalities in zoning. 
However, it will be a negotiating tool that property owners do not now have. And it will take a small step in the right direction. It is a modest step.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you. Another 5 minutes. 
So I urge my colleagues to support cloture so that we can get to the merits of this legislation and debate it, to give it a full debate, because it most certainly is necessary. 
In closing, let me just say a few words. My distinguished colleague from Vermont painted a most beautiful picture of the way Vermont looks. I hope to get to see it for myself someday. I sure have seen it in pictures, and I want to take my children there. Now, myself, I have spent many days on the shores of Lake Pontchartrain and flying over the marshes of Louisiana, seeing the beautiful sunsets, and have spent time on the west coast and on the east coast. And just this past weekend I was at a beautiful place in Maryland. I am well aware, as all of our colleagues are, how beautiful this land is and how grateful we should be to God for the land that He has given us. 
But I do not think there is anything really, Madam President, that is more beautiful than the Constitution of the United States, and particularly the Bill of Rights. And I just want to remind our colleagues of the beautiful words of the amendments, the 10 amendments that make up the Bill of Rights, of which this is one that we speak today--the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the right of people to peacefully assemble, the right of people to petition their Government for redress of grievances, the right to life, liberty, and property, due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation. 
These are beautiful words. And it is our job to make sure that these words have meaning, that they are not just written on a piece of paper to be talked about or referred to in speeches, but that they actually work. And that is what this bill is--a modest attempt to clarify something that most certainly needs clarification. 
Let me quote from the Washington Post editorial that my distinguished colleague from Vermont also referred to, an editorial opposing this bill. It takes exceptions with this bill. Actually, when I read this article, I thought it was a great example or outlined the three points of why this bill should be passed. And I would like to quote: 
Current takings law is murky [the Washington Post says], but its murkiness strikes a useful balance, allowing government to implement zoning, environmental and other rules that can restrict the use of private property while still permitting compensation where that property is physically invaded or grievously devalued. That balance [it says] should not be altered [because it is murky]. 
Madam President, I do not think our constitutional rights should be murky. I do not think people in America think that our constitutional rights should be murky--the right of free speech, the right of free press, the right to own your own property. And if it is taken from you, and totally eliminated of its value, you should be compensated. And everyone in America has their right for their day in court. I do not believe, Madam President, that our rights should be murky. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture later this afternoon. 
Thank you, Madam President, and I yield the balance of my time.

 Ms. LANDRIEU. 
Mr. President, today I introduce legislation on behalf of myself and Senator Breaux that is very important to the States of Texas and Louisiana, as well as to our neighboring country of Mexico. This bill will designate the El Camino Real de los Tejas Trail in Texas and Louisiana as a National Historic Trail. This legislation is the culmination of efforts by interested parties in Texas, Louisiana and Mexico, including legislators and members of academia, to study the feasibility and suitability of designating this exceptional complex of roads as part of the National Trails System. 
El Camino Real, comprised of economically important roads in Mexico and the United States, was used by Native Americans and the colonial powers of Spain, France and England during the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. These viceregal roads were used for exploration, conquest, mission supply, settlement, cultural exchange and military campaigns, connecting a series of Spanish missions and posts between Monclova, Mexico and Los Adaes, the first capital of the province of Texas, now located in the Red River Valley of Louisiana. In the late seventeenth century, French interests expanded westward from the Mississippi River Valley into Spanish Texas. The official Spanish response was retaliatory. As a result, routes were extended from Mexico north and east into Louisiana. The historic remnants of these efforts can be found today at the Spanish outpost of Los Adaes in northwest Louisiana and the French frontier post of Fort St. Jean the Baptiste near Natchitoches, Louisiana. 
El Camino Real de los Tejas, named for the Indian tribes living in what is now east Texas and northwest Louisiana, begins in Maverick County, Texas and extends into Sabine and Natchitoches Parishes in Louisiana. Historically, the trail was composed of several routes, including Camino Pita, Upper Presidio Road, Upper Road, Lower Road, Lower Presidio Road, Camino de en Medio, and the Laredo Road. These roads were established beginning in 1689. The Old San Antonio Road, sometimes called the Camino de Arriba, the nineteenth century route between San Antonio and Natchitoches, is a separate road system that in part followed El Camino Real and overlaps it in many segments. It was used by famous politicians and expansionists, such as Sam Houston and Davy Crockett. Altogether, the roads in the United States make up approximately 2,500 miles of changing routes in Texas and eighty miles in Louisiana. As an important observation, there may well be evidence procured in the future that will show that El Camino Real de los Tejas extended all the way to the Natchez Trace. 
In July, the National Park Service will complete its study of the El Camino Real de los Tejas with a positive determination of suitability and feasibility for establishment of a national historic trail. This comes after enthusiastic support from the Natchitoches community, including Northwestern State University and the Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism. Strong support and contribution to the research and potential of trail designation came from the Texas Department of Transportation, the Texas Historical Commission, consultants, and many others. Trail designation would make possible coordination of activities along the length of the trail. It also would mean increased opportunities for coordination with the Mexican government on respective resource preservation and research, as well as enhanced opportunities for cooperative educational programs and tourism related to El Camino Real de los Tejas. The study anticipates little, if any, federal acquisition of private land, and only on a willing seller basis. Instead, the management of the trail would depend on cooperative partnerships between the National Park Service and other administering agencies, interested property owners or land managers, and other entities.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I introduce a measure to extend the authorization for appropriations for the National Historic Preservation Fund, as established in the Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1976. On September 30, 1997, the authorization for deposits into the Historic Preservation Fund from revenues due and payable to the United States under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act expired. I am introducing this legislation today with the purpose in mind of re-authorizing the deposits at the same level of $150,000,000 annually through the year 2004. 
The Historic Preservation Fund is based on the idea that a part of proceeds from depletion of a non-renewable resource, off shore gas and oil, should be invested in the enhancement of other non-renewable resources: historic properties. The Historic Preservation Fund account supports roughly half the cost of the Nation's historic preservation program as created by the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470). State governments contribute the other half of the cost. This is a true Federal-State partnership. 
States and certain local governments and Indian tribes carry out the Nation's historic preservation program under the Act for the Secretary of the Interior and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. The historic preservation program involves the identification of historic places, working with property owners in nominating significant places to the National Register, consulting with federal agencies on projects that may adversely impact historic places, advising investors on tax credits for the rehabilitation of historic buildings, and offering information and educational opportunities to the private and public sectors on historic preservation. 
The national historic preservation program, made possible by the Historic Preservation Fund (plus the State match), contributes significantly to community revitalization for the benefit of residents, to heritage tourism by identifying places people want to visit, and to economic development through the rehabilitation of commercial buildings and rental housing ($1.7 billion in construction costs in fiscal year 1997). 
I believe this is an extremely worthwhile program that works. We should re-authorize this fund so that important restoration and revitalization efforts may continue across the country, done with the assistance of State Historic Preservation Offices and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be entered into the Record.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Dodd from Connecticut, and commend him, Senator Bond, and Senator Kerry for offering this very important amendment to this very important bill. I want to say a few words, if I could, as a supporter. 
The issue that has been most contentious about this tobacco legislation has been how do we really stop people--children, 
adults and young people--from smoking? We have debated that. Many of us feel like the best way, the surest way to stop people from smoking, from using a dangerous product that has now been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt to be dangerous, is to raise the price of a pack of cigarettes high enough to discourage as many young people as possible from even starting to smoke and, frankly, discourage adults, who most certainly have a choice, from continuing a habit. It is a purposeful levy. If we could stop people from smoking by not raising the price of a pack of cigarettes, perhaps we should consider that. But I am convinced, as many Members of this Chamber are, that this is the best and most effective way, along with counteradvertising, advertising restrictions, and other restrictions, which, in fact, will be effective. 
The question becomes, what do we do with the proceeds generated? Because it is going to fall regressively, in a sense, on poorer people, I think we should try to get the money back to those who are going to pay the tax. We can do that in a number of ways. One way is to target a general tax relief, which, as this bill moves through, I hope we can do. But another way that my colleagues have come up with is targeting some of this money back to hard-working American families--in most instances, with both parents working full time and, in some instances, there is only one parent--to help them with the great costs they are incurring and the great challenge that they have, which is how to be good workers and how to be good parents. It is incumbent upon us to try to get some of this money back to these families that are going to pay this tax and their children for one reason: Because children were targeted by the industry. There is no question about it. They were targeted by the industry. In my opinion, they should benefit from the proceeds generated in this tobacco settlement. To leave the children out and not specifically designate a portion for them, even though they are going to get some benefit from their research that is done, would be a shame. 
It still gives States discretion about how they would like to spend a part of the money coming in. But it says that we want you to use at least 50 percent of your restricted funds to support child initiatives, child care particularly, and to improve the quality of child care. Because children were targeted, they should benefit. Because families who are paying the tax--poor families primarily, lower-income families--this amendment targets this benefit to them and allows them to get accessible, affordable, and quality child care. 
Let me say one other thing that in some way angers me as a working mom myself. Some people would like to maybe make judgments about families that choose to work, or parents outside of the home, or inside of the home. I would like to say maybe ideally it would be great for every child in America to have two parents, and perhaps it would be ideal if one of those parents would stay home full time. But this is not an ideal world; this is a world where families have to make tough choices. 
Frankly, we have an economy now in America that depends on almost every able-bodied person over 18 to work. If people haven't noticed, there is a worker shortage in America for skilled work, for talented work. Our businesses can't survive unless there are workers working. So we have to do both. We have to work outside of the home. We have to be good parents to our children, and one way is to have the Government help parents who are doing everything that they can do. One way we can do that is to help them, be a partner with them, to find good-quality child care, because investing in our children is the best thing we can do to help our families, to help our country, to keep our economy strong, and do what is right with the proceeds of this tobacco bill. 
So I urge all of my colleagues. I think this has great bipartisan support. It would be a shame to pass this bill without this amendment on it and to fall down in our commitment to the children and working families of our country. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me ask my colleagues to join me in voting against the second-degree amendment to my underlying amendment on blue ribbon schools. This is a do-nothing amendment.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this amendment is a do-nothing amendment. In some ways it could be harmful to the current blue ribbon program that is so excellent now in our country, because if this amendment would pass, you would not be able to reward private and parochial schools who are doing an excellent job. A wonderful thing about our blue ribbon school program is that it recognizes excellence across the board and helps us. It will give them more than a blue ribbon and a plaque; it will give them some financial incentive to continue to do good work. 
I ask my colleagues to vote `no' on the Kempthorne amendment and then to support our blue ribbon amendment, which is the underlying amendment. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as this body knows, many on both sides of this aisle support blue ribbon schools because we believe that we should begin rewarding excellence, funding results, and we should stop funding failures. Blue ribbon schools are chosen by their States every year. Some of them are public--many of them. Some of them are private. Some of them are parochial. When they achieve against the odds and when their students succeed, we call them to Washington and they come, 250 of them every year. We give them a beautiful, shiny plaque and a big blue ribbon and we send them home with nothing else but the plaque and the blue ribbon. They are happy to get it, but what they really want and need are some resources to continue doing their good work. 
So I think this is a better way to spend the $1.5 billion. Instead of helping just a few people in America, we can help all of our schools and begin rewarding results. That is what this amendment does, the blue ribbon school amendment. I ask my colleagues to support it.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Today, Mr. President, and colleagues, is a very special day in America. We are celebrating here in the Senate, and millions of people around our Nation are celebrating this special day. It is `Take Our Daughters to Work Day.' And mothers and fathers and aunts and uncles and friends are taking their special charges to work with them to see perhaps a side of life that some young girls do not get to see. 
It is the sixth year that our Nation has celebrated in this way. I wanted to just say for the record that we have made a lot of progress in our Nation in the past 30 years. In 1968, only 20 percent of 18- to 24-year-old women were enrolled in college. Today, thank goodness that number is climbing, and we are at 36 percent. 
The median earnings for women in 1968 was only $18,500. Today, women earn an average of $23,000. We are making progress, but not enough. 
I saw a statistic the other day that still 80 percent of all women who work out of the home earn less than $25,000, earning 74 cents on every dollar earned by their male counterparts. 
In 1968, women owned fewer than 5 percent of the Nation's businesses. That number has doubled, and I am proud to say that there are more people employed by women-owned businesses than all the Fortune 500 companies in the country. So we are making progress. 
Today is a day to honor the progress that is being made. But it is also a day to encourage our young girls, particularly in the ages of 9 to 15, to reach for their dreams, to expand their horizons, to consider all the great options that are available for them as they think about beginning to make choices about their careers. They can balance home life and work life and they can chose careers that were unheard of just a few years ago. 
I hope some of these young girls who are here today with us will think about the Senate, I say to our colleague from Michigan, to think about encouraging more young women to run here for the Senate. 
So I thank my colleagues for giving me this time to recognize this day. I want to welcome my niece with me today, Gracie Landrieu, who came up--my daughter is only 10 months old, so she is a little too young to appreciate today. But she is going to be with me for a few minutes later today. But my niece, who is 10, can most certainly appreciate the great challenges before her. And I wish her all the best, as we do all of our daughters across America. 
Thank you.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I send this amendment to the desk to offer an alternative to my distinguished colleague from Georgia, an alternative in the way we would spend this $1.6 billion that we have been debating and have been debating for some time now. 
Let me thank my colleague from Georgia for at least getting the Senate to begin a significant debate about the ways in which we can improve the status of education in our Nation. I, frankly, am one Senator who believes that there is nothing really more important that we can spend our time on now than talking about this important issue. I think the debate has been very lively. It has come with controversy. But I thank my colleague from Georgia for at least offering this idea, so that we can have a debate about the best way to spend our money when it comes to trying to improve our schools, which, in my opinion, is the number one priority of all Americans, regardless of whether they have children in school or not. We all know as a nation the value of our education system, both public as well as private. 
I was very open to this idea initially as it was presented. I have, I think, demonstrated in the year I have been here an ability to be open to new ideas about how to solve this problem. I don't think the old ways work. I don't believe the American public wants us to just throw more money at a problem. I think they are looking at innovation and creativity in improving our schools. I think the American people, particularly people in Louisiana, have witnessed many schools that are working, many pilot programs and initiatives, whether it is charter schools and more accountability, teacher training, teacher testing, or higher student achievement and things that are working. 
So I looked, with hope perhaps, at this bill, now called the Coverdell-Torricelli proposal, but after looking at the studies that have come in about who would really benefit from this initiative to spend $1.5 billion, it is clear to me from the GAO report and other economists reporting that the major benefit of this $1.5 billion to be spent over 5 years would go to a very small segment of parents and families who have their children in private or nonpublic schools. 
I want to be part of a team of Senators and leaders who support efforts that help all schools as fairly as they can. There are some in this body and in Congress who do not want to do very much at all to help parochial or private schools. I am not in that group. I believe our Government within the framework of our Constitution should try to help all of our schools and all of our students. But this is not the best way we can go about this, and that is why I am not going to be able to support the bill and would offer this amendment as a substitute, if you will.

Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, if I can continue, my amendment is called the blue ribbon schools amendment. It is quite simple. It would take the money we would otherwise be setting aside for these very small savings accounts that would reach only a small group of beneficiaries and spread it over all 50 States, to many schools in those States that have been designated basically by their peers to be blue ribbon schools and schools of excellence. It is time that we in this country stop at the Federal level--and I hope we can encourage States and local governments to stop--funding failure and start rewarding results and success. 
That is what this amendment does. This amendment will take the money otherwise spent by the distinguished Senator from Georgia and give $100,000 grants to all of the schools designated, and there are 250 so designated each year, as the most excellent schools in America. They are public; they are parochial; they are private. There have been 3,000 schools that have achieved this designation since this program started 10 years ago. 
It is currently operating this way. The schools are rigorously evaluated and 250 are chosen. They are invited to come to Washington. They are given a plaque and a pat on the back and they are basically sent home. I think we need to do more than give them a pat on the back and a plaque to hang on their school wall, as proud as they are to display this plaque, 
and begin to reward success and say, congratulations, a job well done and here is $100,000 to help you continue that good job. 
Many of these schools are succeeding despite the odds because they have bitten the bullet; they have made tough choices; they are making good decisions at the local level. I think the most important thing we in the Federal Government can do is to begin acknowledging success and rewarding success. 
That is what this amendment does. It also provides a small amount of money to help the States administer this very cost-effective program because it is a locally based initiative. It is a panel of their peers who makes these choices. It would be a great way to spend this $1 billion to reward these schools. 
Madam President, that is simply what this amendment does. It is a blue ribbon school amendment. I think it will go a long way to encouraging schools that are beating the odds to continue to do so, and we will reward them with something significant. So they can take that $100,000 and apply it to technology, teacher training, and other opportunities for students. And this is available, I want to stress, for parochial and private schools, as well as public, within the constitutional framework so that we are better reaching across all of the Nation to many of the schools and doing it in a fair way. That is what my amendment does, and I offer it as a substitute. 
In closing, let me say this is only 1 of 10 or 15 ways on which I personally think it is better to spend this $1.5 billion, that will have a longer and a greater impact on improving education than establishing these savings accounts. 
I did not get to speak on Senator Glenn's amendment, but I will just say another way to spend this $1 billion would be to expand the IRA from $500 to $2,000, which he so eloquently talked about yesterday. It would be another good way to have a positive effect in encouraging people to save early for their children's college education, which is so expensive. 
So with all due respect to my colleague from Georgia for all of the good remarks he has made, there are just better ways to spend the money. This blue ribbon school amendment is only one, but I commend it and recommend it to this body to consider.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, the Senator from Massachusetts understands this correctly and has articulated it very accurately. The reason that I am unable to support Senator Coverdell's proposal is because it is clear from the studies that the vast majority of the benefit would go to just a small portion of those in parochial or private schools. 
I believe that we need to be more balanced in our approach to help all of our schools and all of our families, as balanced as we can be, and not try to put one above the other. 
So, this amendment gives funding to parochial schools, to private schools, and to public schools, based on their efforts to be excellent. And, as the Senator knows, sometimes against great odds, in very poor districts, these schools--many parochial schools--are doing a great job. I believe they should be rewarded within the framework of the Constitution, which is clearly appropriate with this program. 
So it is my hope that the Senate and the Congress will strongly consider this approach, because this is exactly what we need to be doing, rewarding and encouraging success.

Ms. LANDRIEU. That is the objective. If I could read into the Record the way the schools are chosen now, it is if they are student focused and have great student support, if their standards are challenging and their curricula challenging, if they are teaching active learning, if they have developed partnerships with their communities, and if they have strong leadership. Those are just some of the measures that are used. 
So, yes, the Senator is correct. As they receive their blue ribbons and their plaques, they are being honored now in our Nation and they are held up to high esteem. The problem is, they basically leave here emptyhanded, because we send them back with a plaque and a ribbon. I think we need send them home with some money and some real help, to put our money where our mouth is and say, `Good job; here's some money to help you continue to do that good job. You make us proud. You have done it against the odds.' 
We want to be a more reliable partner. That is what I think the greatness is with this amendment. There are other approaches we could use, but this is, I think, getting us on the right track. 
I thank the Senator, and I yield back whatever time I have remaining.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I will use the remainder of my time to thank my distinguished colleague from Tennessee for agreeing that this amendment is, in fact, on the right track and for saying that it is about time we begin rewarding success and innovation, it is about time we become a reliable partner with our local schools that are achieving, despite sometimes great difficulty, and to begin rewarding them. I thank him for his comments. 
I do not disagree with him as he laid out all of the problems associated currently with our public and general education system in the United States. No one in this Chamber disagrees with the sad statistics about lack of achievement, lack of discipline, et cetera, although I want to say for the Record that there are many, many, many good public schools, private and parochial schools in this Nation, of which we should be proud. The fact is that we need to have every one to be excellent, but we are falling from the mark. 
Let me, if I can, Madam President, in the 1 minute I have left, call to your attention one of the real failings of the Coverdell proposal. 
In order to save money, obviously, you have to save it for a long period of time for it to generate any benefit to the saver. One of the problems with setting aside $500 to begin using in kindergarten is that you don't have the money set aside long enough for there to be a benefit to a family. So what we are saying is a $30 benefit is not really that great a benefit. There are so many better ways we can spend this money to really improve education. 
If we want to have a savings plan, which I would support, and prepaid college tuition, which is certainly one I support, then let's do some real saving in this country. Let's really save $500 or $2,000, which is part of the Coverdell proposal that I do agree with. Let's set aside money, increase it--which is what Senator Glenn tried to do--from $500 to $2,000 a year to enable families, from when their child is 1, if they save until 17 at a 6 percent yield, to save $60,000. If they received a 12 percent return, they could save over $110,000 approximately. Then you are talking about real money, and you are talking about real benefit, and you are talking about real savings, and you are talking about a Tax Code that really might work and do something good. If we had adopted John Glenn's amendment, this is what people in America would be doing, and I would be proud to sign my name to it.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to lend my strong support to the efforts of my colleague from Ohio, Senator Glenn. Our colleague from Georgia has introduced a bill which he claims will improve savings for education. Unfortunately, the evidence from economists seems to disagree with him. The average American family would save only $37 under Senator Coverdell's approach. 
The reason for this is simple to understand. In order to experience real economic benefit from a tax free savings plan, the principle and interest must stay untouched for significant periods of time in order to have a chance to grow. With H.R. 2646, parents would be allowed to deposit up to $2,000 into an educational IRA, which is a significant increase over the $500 they are currently allowed to contribute. However, Senator Coverdell would also allow these families to withdraw funds from the education accounts for the annual costs of elementary and secondary education. So in essence, you would have families depositing $2,000 into an educational savings account, accruing some limited tax savings, and withdrawing it the next year. 
Under this scenario, there are no long terms savings, no accumulated interest and none of the real benefits that we are attempting to create with these educational IRAs. That is why I am so pleased with the approach taken by my friend, John Glenn. Through Senate Amendment 2017, families would be able to contribute more to their tax free savings accounts, however, it would be reserved for higher education expenses. By increasing the contribution limit to $2,000, Americans can all reap the benefit of increased savings for education. They will see their principle grow with compound interest and Congress will preserve the true intention of this newly created IRA.

Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for his great and tireless leadership on this important issue. 
Mr. President, it has been well stated, the need for child care in the United States. But the point I want to make is that the child care that is just barely there now in our system is not really affordable to working families. As much as there is not enough of it, and not enough spots, we have a real crisis, as my colleague from Connecticut and others realize, because even if it were available under the current system, it is not really affordable to working families. 
We have the majority, 65 percent of moms--and I am in that 65 percent; I am a working mom here in the Senate. I have a 6-year-old and an 8-month-old, so I can really speak to all those mothers and fathers who are working with children at home. Some of us work out of choice, but many of us work out of necessity. Many, many parents have to work; they don't have a choice to be at home. Because of some laws that we just recently passed--welfare-to-work and welfare reform, which I generally supported--we have now mandated it. It is not a choice that many poor women have now; we have actually mandated that they leave home and go to work. So we have made what was a problem 2 years ago even greater by forcing many women, who were home, out to work. 
It seems to me that in our efforts towards welfare reform--which, again, I support--some Members of this Congress might be somewhat hypocritical in mandating poor women to go to work, wanting to give tax breaks for middle class women to stay home, and then not providing child care to anybody that is affordable to anybody. Mr. President, that is really the situation we are in, which is a crying shame for the working families in our country. 
I know my colleague from Connecticut knows the average cost of out-of-home care is $6,000. For even two parents who are working at a minimum wage 40 hours a week, their income is $21,000. By the time they pay whatever taxes and other requirements for that paycheck, they don't even take home enough money to pay for the child care. 
So what are some of the options? Some of the options have been outlined, mostly on this side of the aisle. Tax credits for businesses--we have to do a better job as an employer, ourselves, in the Senate, in the Federal Government, to make our systems and our centers more affordable to all of our employees, from our highest paid to our lowest paid. We can do that. We can also provide some direct subsidies, some tax credits, and then some block grants, in addition, to States to expand the slots that they have. 
But my final point on this is to say to this Senate and to our colleagues that we can talk about family values, talk about how much we love our children, talk about how important families are, but, really, our checkbooks reflect our priorities. In this budget, it doesn't reflect that our priorities are our families or our children. Only Government, through some action--not by doing it all--can pull this system in our country together for child care and reward, if we will, the families who are working and have made the best choices they can for their families. 
I hope we can adopt the amendment of Senator Dodd and many other amendments that speak to this issue, because there is a crisis in this country and one that we should not ignore and one that our checkbook--not our words but our checkbook--should reflect. 
I thank the Senator from Connecticut.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, by implementing such a program we will enhance our region's national economic competitiveness, especially in our natural resource sector which has been the backbone of our economy; contribute to the revitalization and growth of both suburban and central city business engaged in global trade; provide new opportunities for job creation throughout metropolitan and rural areas; and promote national efficiency. With hundreds of major navigable waterways, ports and rail systems throughout Louisiana, we are favored by many in the Midwest and Eastern United States as the gateway to the Southern Hemisphere. Louisiana is of vital importance to the United States as such a gateway and very supportive of additional federal funding to better connect their water, rail and transportation systems that are vital to enhancing international trading opportunities for our nation. 
While I understand that the managers of S. 1173 will not include additional funding amendments in this bill, such as the one Senator Breaux and I propose, I hope to work on this proposal with Senate leaders during conference with the House to promote intermodalism in those places where we can gain the greatest national benefit.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of Louisiana's own true American heroes, Major General Ansel M. Stroud, Jr., Adjutant General for the State of Louisiana. 
A native of Shreveport, Louisiana, General Stroud began his distinguished career in April of 1944, when he enlisted in the United States Army and was commissioned a second lieutenant following completion of Officer Candidate School in 1946. After serving active duty, he joined the Louisiana National Guard in June of 1947. During his service with the National Guard, he has served as a reconnaissance officer, company commander, regimental supply officer, aide to the commanding general of the 39th Infantry Division, and battalion commander. In 1968, he was assigned as Chief of Staff for the State Emergency Operations Center, and became commander of the 356th Support Center (RAO) in 1971. He was appointed to the position of Assistant Adjutant General on May 9, 1972, and in August 1978 accepted a dual assignment as the commander of the 256th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized). In October 1980, General Stroud accepted his current position of Adjutant General for Louisiana. 
When reminiscing about General Stroud's career, one could easily point to his many military decoration and awards: most notably included are the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Meritorious Service Medal with one Oak Leaf Cluster, the Army Commendation Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, the Louisiana Distinguished Service Medal, the Louisiana Cross of Merit and the Louisiana Emergency Service Medal with 19 Fleurs-de-lis just to name a few of the honors bestowed upon him. One can also see the direct impact his time in the Armed Services has made with such works as the `Stroud Study.' When General Stroud was selected to conduct a Department of Army study on full-time training and administration for the Guard and Reserve, his Study was accepted as a guideline for requirements of the National Guard and Army Reserve for full-time manning programs and was the basis for launching the AGR program. 
In addition to his duties as Adjutant General, there are many other areas of service in which he has fulfilled with great distinction: the Boy Scouts of America in which he earned the Silver Beaver Award and the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award; past-president of the Adjutants General Association of the United States; past-president of the National Guard Association of the United States; and service as a member of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Advisory Board representing the National Guard Association of the United States. 
Mr. President, I would, however, be remiss if I did not mention what I feel has been one of the most important aspects of the General's service to Louisiana: serving as the Director of the Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness (LOEP). Throughout the years, Louisianas have become all too familiar with life-threatening dangers presented by mother nature at her worst. General Stroud has certainly taken the motto `be prepared' to heart by ensuring that Louisiana is capable of handling the impact of natural disasters with order and efficiency. Under his supervision, operations at LOEP have undergone state-of-the art advances which have allowed personnel to provide immediate assistance to citizens affected by nature's fury. 
Mr. President, many individuals have a calling to serve the public in a variety of ways. They make sacrifices to contribute their talents to the safety, security and well-being of others. These are the individuals whose commitment to excellence and selfless dedication are evident through their leadership and the challenges they choose to accept. On November 8, 1997, General Ansel Stroud will relinquish his present position as Adjutant General, a position he has dutifully held for over seventeen years of his fifty-three years of service to our country. Although he is leaving the realm of public service, the contributions he has made to the greater good of the State of Louisiana will continue to have affect for years to come. It is my most sincere wish that General Stroud and Jane, his wife, will reap all the best which life has to offer, May God bless and God speed.

As you know, the Federal Government, through the Minerals Management Service and the Bureau of Land Management at the Department of the Interior shares with the States 50 percent of the mineral revenues from Federal lands inside the boundary of States, to offset the impacts of onshore mineral development. Unlike the States that support onshore development of Federal mineral resources, Louisiana, particularly, and Texas, Alaska, California, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida receive comparatively little of the revenues received by the Federal Government for offshore oil and gas development on the Outer Continental Shelf. 
I intend very shortly to introduce legislation to realign the OCS revenues to reflect a more fair and more just allocation. This legislation will also address historical and anticipated impacts on infrastructure and environmental needs that have been identified over the course of time. I raise this issue as the Senate today, Mr. President, will be voting on the Interior and related agencies appropriations conference report this afternoon. That bill contains funding for land and water conservation and the National Historic Preservation Fund. All of those moneys, almost up to $1 billion authorized, comes from OCS revenues. So the Federal Treasury has been a great beneficiary, and many States, of course, have shared in these revenues. 
This year also marks the 50th anniversary of oil and gas exploration and production in the United States off the gulf coast. We have come a long way from the early days when a few intrepid souls dared to combine their resources to take a risk on a black pitch-like substance that was seeping out of the hills of Pennsylvania. They discovered that this substance would burn. From that substance kerosene was derived and then came gasoline and numerous other petroleum products that support the American economy and the American lifestyle today. 
Oil and gas development has long been the lifeblood of my State--through good times and bad, through the early years of this century and the bust years of the 1980's. In Louisiana, as in other oil-patch States, there was an abundance of oil and gas. Many people dug wells, plugged them, and made and lost fortunes. 
In the 1970's, there was an oil boom that no one thought would end, but it did. During that time, businesses sprang up in Oklahoma and Texas and throughout the oil patch with businesses building headquarters in cities like Tulsa, Houston, and Dallas. In the Gulf of Mexico, oil and gas platforms appeared. People discovered a wealth of reserves in coastal waters and, later, in Federal waters, particularly off the coast of Louisiana. 
Mr. President, I want to share with you today, and many Members of the Senate, that all of the production in the gulf identified is by these squares that are blocked off. You can see that almost 90 percent, from approximately this line to all the way over is off Louisiana's coast. About 90 percent of the production is supported off Louisiana's coast, and that is the point I want to make today. It is not all the coastal States supporting it equally. Louisiana is contributing a huge amount to this development, which is contributing a huge amount of money to the Federal Treasury. 
The history of OCS development and State versus Federal ownership was defined in the time of President Truman. There was a great deal of discussion on this issue between interested parties, with no real solution as to how these proceeds should be fairly divided. The controversy continued briefly through the forties and fifties. Finally, legislation came in 1953. This act established a 3-mile State water boundary for Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and, for historical reasons, a 10-mile border for Texas and the gulf coast of Florida. 
The understanding was that States would own the resources up to 3 miles out from their coastal boundaries, and the Federal Government would own the resources beyond the 3-mile mark, and that lasted for years. In addition, in 1985, a new zone was created through an amendment to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the 
8g zone. So between 3 and 6 miles, the States on the coast can now benefit in some additional ways, but rather minor, from the oil and gas derived from that 3- to 6-mile zone. 
The most recent Federal law to apply to the Outer Continental Shelf was passed in the last Congress, through the leadership of my predecessor, former Senator Bennett Johnston. This measure, the Outer Continental Shelf Deepwater Royalty Relief Act, provided a royalty incentive for companies that wished to explore in deep waters off the continental shelf but were constrained by the cost of deepwater drilling. 
Today, as a result of this act, you can see from the previous chart that there have been record sales and bids off the gulf coast, particularly in Louisiana. In March of this year, lease sale No. 166 was held in the central gulf, and 103 companies bid on over 5,000 blocks comprising 27 million acres offshore Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The companies made record bids. Fifty-one percent of these blocks were in 800 meters of water. The deepest block was in 9,000 feet of water. 
The mind-boggling total value of these bids was in excess of $800 million. Mr. President, five additional sales are planned beginning in March. All of this is due to the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act which has created thousands of good paying jobs in the energy industry, both onshore and offshore. The Federal Treasury has benefited substantially. The Federal Treasury received an amount of $2.8 billion from these leases in 1995. Louisiana contributed $2.1 billion. These figures do not include corporate taxes and taxes that were also collected for the Federal Treasury. 
I need to clarify the funding situation for those who are listening today. When there is onshore oil and gas production, States are entitled to 50 percent of the royalties. Alaska gets 90 percent onshore. For coastal States with offshore production in 8g, States receive only 27 percent, and beyond the 6-mile mark for Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, States are not entitled to any percentage. That is the point of this discussion. 
In conclusion, let me say that we need to make this distribution more fair and more equitable. With the amounts of money that are being distributed based on 50 percent for onshore, based on 90 percent for Alaska, but now under the current law, outside of this 6 miles, the coastal States receive almost nothing. The amount of money being generated is greater and greater every year. Just last year, as I mentioned, it was up to $2.8 billion received by the Federal Treasury. And of that amount, Louisiana received less than $16 million from contributing over 90 percent of the production totaling almost $3 billion. We received only $15.9 million. 
For 50 years, Louisiana has borne the brunt of the impacts associated with oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. While we acknowledge that hosting offshore production has provided some economic rewards in the State, Louisiana cannot tax the production on the OCS, nor do we receive a share of the governmental payments on the OCS. There has been damage to onshore staging areas, damage from activities by the Corps of Engineers, and deterioration of infrastructure such as roads and highways that are used to get equipment and workers to the offshore fields. The State of Louisiana has not received appropriate compensation for the use of its land and the environmental impacts of this production. 
Moreover, Mr. President, we have a very fragile environment in south Louisiana. I have visited Port Fouchon, in La Fourche Parish many times. La Fourche Parish is a rural, relatively isolated parish at the bottom of the `L' in Louisiana, if you picture the State in the form of the letter `L.' The people there are of modest means, and do their best to make a good living. Port Fouchon is Louisiana's only port on the Gulf of Mexico. Its proximity to the deepwater oil and gas discoveries makes it the port of choice for an increasing number of businesses. Over 6,000 people depend on the port as an avenue to and from offshore facilities. In just 3 years, Port Fouchon has tripled 
the amount of cargo it handles--from 10 million to over 30 million tons in 1996. 
Near Port Fouchon is the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port [LOOP]. LOOP is a state of the art offshore facility located 20 miles south of Port Fouchon. LOOP is connected through five pipelines to over 30 percent of the Nation's refining capacity. Recently, the deepwater platform Mars, by Shell Oil, was connected by pipeline to LOOP. Consequently, LOOP will be handling a significant portion of the Gulf of Mexico's domestic deepwater oil production. Couple this with the recently announced goal that the MMS would like to increase oil production in the gulf from 1.7 to 2 million barrels of oil a day. This is an extremely ambitious schedule. Such an increase would amount to an additional $600 million in royalties by the year 2000. Yet, there has been little attention to infrastructure in La Fourche Parish, and little attention to the environment. According to Bob Thompson, president of LOOP, `Nearly all of LOOP's logistical support for offshore operations comes directly through Port Fouchon, and hence across substandard roadways. We must improve our highway infrastructure to accommodate this new business.' Currently, over 80 deepwater prospects are identified off coastal Louisiana. An astounding 75 percent of these are in the Port Fouchon service area. Terrebonne and St. Mary Parishes, St. Bernard, and Jefferson which are adjacent to La Fourche, will also support industry activity. Many of the parishes need additional help as well as other coastal States. These new demands will put a great deal of stress on an already besieged environment. Mr. President, these areas and their fragile environments in Louisiana were sacrificed long ago for the benefit of industry investment and development. I intend to ensure that these areas will be ignored no longer. 
Since the early 1990's, the Minerals Management Service at the Department of the Interior and various heads of environment and natural resource departments from a number of States have been holding talks and negotiations over revenue sharing from the funds collected from activity in the gulf. This month, in fact, tomorrow, the OCS Policy Committee will be meeting in Galveston, TX, to vote on a revenue sharing initiative. I commend this method of consensus building that the Department, industry, and the States have undertaken to address revenue sharing and its implementation. But I want to go further than just recognizing their actions, Mr. President. 
In the next few weeks, I will be filing the bill to bring this issue to the attention of the U.S. Senate to ask for a greater distribution and a more fair distribution to those States impacted so that we can continue to support this industry, but in return this industry can and the Federal Treasury can invest back into Louisiana and other coastal States so we can continue this drilling in an environmentally sensitive way. 
Through advances in technology and favorable laws, we have come upon a great resource for this Nation, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. At the same time, we must take advantage of this economic boon to reinvest in our environment, to repair damage to our wetlands, and to take stock of our natural resources and their value as we benefit in the coming years from activity in the gulf. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I thank you for the time.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, in introducing the Property Owners Access to Justice Act of 1997. 
Mr. President, in my view, this bill is particularly aptly named. Justice and fairness are what this bill is all about. Unlike other countries, when this Nation was created, we did so with a contract between the people and the Government. It is not very long, but the freedoms it guarantees are quite profound. Among its provisions is a simple promise from the Government to the people. Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. These very few words included in our Constitution provide one of the strongest defenses we have against arbitrary government. The certainty that our property cannot be expropriated by government without our being compensated, provides the essential infrastructure for America's great economic strength. We could never be the world's largest market without such an assurance. 
However, for often well-intentioned reasons, all levels of government have made claims on private property which conflict with the protections of the fifth amendment. Whether through zoning, environmental protections, or claims of eminent domain, people have found their property rights under increasing assault. Unfortunately, not only are their rights under assault, but then they have inadequate protection in our legal system. 
We should not be confused as to whom this bill helps. Large corporations and wealthy landowners and developers do not need our help in Congress. They can hire a legion of lawyers and lobbyists to take up their case at city hall, at the statehouse, or even here in Washington. Whether this bill passes or not, their interests will be protected. The people we help with this bill are the small landowners and family farmers who lack the means to expedite the administrative process. It will help first-time home buyers in my State, who are trying to build their first home but have to put their plans on hold because they run into administrative deadlocks. 
Our bill will help these people and countless others in two ways. First, it will clarify when a person has exhausted their administrative remedies. Right now, property owners spend countless hours and great expense in fruitless litigation over this subject. Legislation to end this unproductive debate should be welcomed by all parties. 
Second, the bill would allow property owners to choose between bringing their claim for relief before Federal or State courts. As it stands, we all possess a fifth amendment right which we have no practical way of enforcing. The Supreme Court has interpreted the fifth amendment as applying to the States under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. However, the Federal courts have left it to State courts to adjudicate fifth amendment claims in this area. Only if issues of State law are resolved in the case, may plaintiffs have their constitutional claim heard in Federal court. Working people simply cannot afford a process that would require them to go all the way through the State court system and then into the federal courts to enforce their constitutional rights. 
Mr. President, it is my hope that our colleagues will join this bipartisan effort and take a concrete step to provide real relief to middle class people. We will all benefit by a judicial process that is more equitable and transparent.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know we will probably soon be voting on this important amendment and on this important issue. 
I was sitting in my office and listening to my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, my friend and neighbor, and thought that I might come down and try to give him some help and support, not that he needs any more help in articulating the issue and speaking about it and outlining it, which he does so beautifully, but to let him know that as a new member of the Energy Committee, one that just arrived here and has not spent even a year here, and with him getting ready to retire and having announced his retirement, that 
I want to let him know I am going to pick up this ball wherever it may land today, I say to Senator Bumpers. 
I come from a State that has obviously some mining interests, but I come from a State that has had oil and gas development and exploration for many years. 
I am from a position of understanding that when it is done correctly how much of a benefit it can be in terms of jobs and economic development and helping people and enriching the corporations and businesses as well as the average working man and woman. 
But I can also see from knowing about our history in Louisiana that when the laws are not fair, when they are not written with the taxpayer in mind, that the taxpayers can be shortchanged. When taxpayers are shortchanged, families are shortchanged, and when families are shortchanged, children are shortchanged. When I think of the hundreds of millions and billions of dollars that could have been allocated differently perhaps in the history of our State as we took out oil and gas, that would have been more fair to everyone. 
I have to sympathize in a great way with what the Senator from Arkansas is speaking about regarding many of our Western States. 
To my great colleague and chairman of the Energy Committee, from a State very far from ours, I do not want him to think that I am meddling in other States' business. I have been in the legislature for many years in my own State. But it is an issue that should concern every taxpayer in America. 
As we look for dollars to send our children to the best of schools that we can provide, when we look and scrape for dollars to provide immunization shots for them so that they can live a healthy life, when we are looking for dollars every day to try to literally make decisions about life and death, to not have these laws and rules and regulations established in such a way to just give fairness to the taxpayer is why I am here. 
I am going to support this amendment. I am coauthoring this amendment. I am going to work diligently with Senator Bumpers and other Members on both sides of this aisle to learn more about the specifics, to be a strong advocate for reform and change, to make sure that this allocation is done fairly for the taxpayers, and for somebody in these rooms to start dealing the deal for the taxpayer for a change and not specifically for a particular company or a particular entity. I know that my colleagues from these other States will keep that in mind as we move along with this amendment and this bill. 
So I thank my colleague from Arkansas for his great work, for 8 years of his impassioned speeches, and hope that many Members of our Senate will become more knowledgeable about this issue because I can understand by looking at this amendment, not even having read all of the details of it, what is causing the consternation. 
We are not talking about $2.50 or $1 or $15. We are talking about $750 and $550 million. When you talk about serious dollars, people wake up and get exercised about it. But it is about time maybe some of this money got into the hands of our children and families that need it that could use it for other things that would be important, not to mention the environmental concerns which are also of great concern to everyone. 
So I am proud to support the amendment. I am happy for my name to be listed as a coauthor. Since I just got here, I plan to spend a lot of time working on the Energy Committee and look forward to working with members of the Energy Committee and others.  
Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, before we vote, I want to make just a couple of additional remarks for the Record. 
Listening to my colleagues speak about the Constitution and the intricacies of whether this is appropriate or not, compels me to say that the most important thing about our Constitution in the United States is the essential component written in that document about justice and fairness. That is what our Constitution is about. That is all this issue is about. It is about fairness and justice to the taxpayers and to the families and to children in our country. 
To the children who come to me now and in the future, and perhaps look a little sad, telling me they come from families that may be poor, they don't have what they need, I remind them that they are not poor, that they live in a State and in a country with bountiful resources. They actually own gold and silver that belong to them. 
But for some reason that I am finding hard to understand, for over 100 years this Senate and the House of Representatives refuses to acknowledge that this is not something we own, the 100 of us sitting here; this is something that the public owns. It belongs not to us, not to a few companies, nor to many companies. It belongs to the children of America. This is their land. It is their gold. It is their silver. And it is our job to make sure they get a fair portion--not all of it--but a fair portion of it. It is clear to me that they have not for 130 years gotten their fair portion of what is theirs, what was given to them--not by us, but by God, and others. 
So I want to make that point for the Record. 
I hope we will vote soon. 
Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise before you today to express my support for the NEA and to articulate the importance of preserving the arts in America. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly describe to my colleagues how the NEA, in it's unique capacity, has strengthened the values and cultural education of the people in my state. Specifically, it has played a critical role in enhancing the local talent and in funding community education activities for all Louisiana families and children. Mr. President, not only has the NEA provided access to the arts for the less advantaged in all of the 64 parishes, reaching a total audience of 7.5 million Louisianians by funding programs like philharmonics, ballets and training for young talented inner-city artists, but NEA has also played a vital role in supporting cultural tourism. The NEA-funded arts programs have remained a consistent source of economic revenue for Louisiana with our rich musical and cultural history. We have a brilliant history of talented local artists and renowned musicians that people from all over the world come to Louisiana to experience. Mr. President, as a nation that values the promotion of individual creative talent and these contributions to our cultural fabric, I encourage and respectfully ask my colleagues not to abandon our national responsibility and to support an equitable balance of grant distribution to the NEA. We have all seen the NEA adhere to the valid concerns of my colleagues, Senator Helms and Senator Sessions. I give Jane Alexander her due credit for putting in place a new organizational structure--including the elimination of all sub-grants and grants to individual artists. Yes, there are clear examples in the past where the NEA should have used better judgment, but I ask my colleagues to concur that this is by no means grounds to deny our children the right to access the arts--and not just on the state level in the form of block grants--but with a national commitment. Mr. President, I do not want to debate the past nor do I think I can define what is art and what is not art. However, there are clear examples across the nation where NEA funding has supported the very talented and worthy people we all represent. I support my colleagues' efforts to continue to fund the NEA and to establish a permanent endowment fund that, matched with private funds, would continue the successful private/public partnerships the NEA has created. I look forward to the opportunity to work with my colleagues to find an agreeable funding formula that will show the American people that this Congress values and supports American culture, our creative talent and the arts.

Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. 
I rise to thank my colleague from Washington State for her admirable work in this area and for her persistence in year after year presenting this amendment that so clearly is deserving on its merits, and coming back again for the third time to this body, which has already expressed strong support for this clarification of this waiver because this body, on both sides of the aisle, Mr. President, I think, understands the great trauma and pain of families experiencing violence, both to the woman primarily and also to the children. 
I rise because I supported the welfare reform effort. I was not here as a new Senator, so I was not able to vote. But I want to say for the record that I support our efforts to change the welfare system in America, as long as those changes allow for job training and day care opportunities and transition. We do need to do a better job in this country of moving people from welfare to work. We need to do a better job of honoring work, particularly for those working at the minimum wage. So I support the changes. 
My colleague from Washington has expressed beautifully that there are some modifications and clarifications that are essential. This one is essential. 
With the suffering that is incurred by millions of children --and I say millions of children--who are in homes where this violence is occurring, the screams in the night, the begging for someone to help, the years of torture and abuse that many children suffer and many spouses suffer, we have to do more. Let us not add to their pain and suffering by letting this remain unclear in the law, when it is so clear that we want to say that the States simply have the right to design temporary relief for them so that they do not have to give certain information that would put them in jeopardy and put their children's lives at risk. 
I can only say how hopeful I am that when we pass this amendment, which looks as if it will pass by a large margin, it will this time stay in this bill for the children of the Nation, who literally--and I wish I could play a tape that I heard just this week by a chief of police who stood up before a group of us and said, `This is a tape that I use for training my officers.' It was horrifying to listen to this child scream in the night for a dispatcher, an operator to send help quickly to the home where a male--I do not know if it was the father or a friend--was beating this child's mother. To close your eyes and listen to this tape and this child's screams was almost more than I and others in the room could stand. 
So let us not add to the suffering. Let us be clear. Let us give the States a chance to do the humane thing. 
I thank the Senator from Washington and I urge our colleagues to support this amendment. 
I thank the Chair.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill. As the Members of the Senate are aware, nearly one-half million children in this country languish in foster care instead of permanent placement. We have had little success in coping with the problem. While the numbers of children in foster care multiply, children trickle into adoptive homes. Last year only a little over 20,000 children were formally adopted. 
Mr. President, these numbers are unacceptable. Recent advances in science and psychology have indicated that early childhood is the critical stage for human development. The nurturing and attention that infants need can only be provided by a loving family. Studies have indicated that the holding, touching, and play that good parents take for granted, actually affects a child's brain size and activity. Sadly, the children most in need of this kind of human warmth, our abused and neglected children, are ill-served by our Nation's adoption placement system. 
Equally distressing is the fact that these same problems in the adoption system are reflected in our budget priorities. In the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill we propose to spend over $4.3 billion on support to foster care. At the same time, we are devoting only $13 million to encourage innovation in state adoption systems. This is a little more than one-third of 1 percent of all the money we are devoting to foster care. 
Our spending priorities are another stark example of our spending billions of dollars in a way that perpetuates a problem instead of resolving it. We need to reprioritize how we address the thousands of children in foster care. This amendment takes a modest step in the right direction. By reallocating $5 million from the administrative costs of the bill to help fund State initiatives in adoption, we can begin the process of addressing the source of the problem rather than its symptoms. 
Presently, the Children's Bureau has 40 grants to States that were either approved but unfunded, or underfunded due to shortfalls. Among the States with unfunded grant applications are Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and the District of Columbia. These grants would affect States large and small and in every region of the country. 
It is my hope that the programs that we fund by providing State grant support may one day provide a national model. Only through innovations like those funded by these grants can we hope to resolve the foster care crisis. I hope you will join me in supporting this amendment. 
I thank my colleague again for the time. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be temporarily set aside for its determination at the appropriate time for a vote.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to share just a few remarks about this important budget reconciliation and adoption. I first thank and congratulate the leaders on both sides of the aisle, to the chairman and to our ranking member of the Finance Committee and the Budget Committee, for all of their hard work and leadership. Nothing of this magnitude is accomplished without good, strong, well informed leadership. I think we have it in our leaders here. 
This bill is not everything that I hoped for. It is not everything that any one individual Member would have wanted. And it is not perfect. But it is a good bill. It is a good start to getting our fiscal house in order. Getting our fiscal house in order and making sure we are spending our money wisely, saving where we can and giving tax relief, is something that I personally feel is supported by the vast majority of Americans, regardless of party, and so many people in Louisiana feel this way. On these difficult problems, such as balancing the budget, neither party can get the job done by themselves. It is going to take both parties to get the job done in the right way for the American people. 
I am very proud, though, of a couple of points in this bill. Again, I show the Meyers family from Shreveport. Because of the good work that we did here in the Senate, and with the leadership of the President--and I will say many of the Democrats supported the expansion of this $500 child tax credit to hard-working, not welfare but hard-working middle-class and moderate-income families--this family, Lois and Scott Meyers, of Shreveport, will be able to take part in the $500 tax credit. Families with earnings up to $110,000 will be able to benefit, which, in Louisiana, covers just about all of our families. The household incomes of 95 percent of our families are under $75,000. So the work that we did, and the fight to make this child credit available to working families like this, I think is something we can all be very proud of. 
Mr. President, 46 percent of Louisiana taxpayers earn less than $20,000 a year--not get less than $20,000, they work hard and only get $20,000 a year. This will really help almost 50 percent of the families in my State and that of Senator Breaux, and we are happy for that victory. 
I also want to say how pleased I am to see our first step, but I hope not our last step, in providing health care to uninsured children. Again, these are children who are of working families, whose parents have jobs--sometimes not just one, sometimes not two, but three jobs--and are still without health insurance for their children. We could, as a country, make no better investment than providing critical health care to zero to 3, zero to 6--helping children to develop in ways that will save us all, as taxpayers, millions and millions of dollars down the line for other expenses like criminal justice or special education. I am looking forward to working with my State leaders to design the kind of health care program for them that is cost-effective, quality oriented, child centered and family centered. I am looking forward to that. 
I also want to say how thrilled I am about the investment in education. Because, really, with President Clinton's lead, we have now invested more money in education than since President Johnson was in the White House. Why is that important? It's important because our country doesn't have a future if our children and our workers are not well educated and well trained, to take advantage of the jobs and challenges that the next century will hold. So the Hope scholarships, the Pell grant expansions, and the student loan deductions, I think, are excellent provisions, to say we believe in education. It is the foundation of our economic development plan for the Nation and we are going to put our money where our mouth is. 
Let me also say to my senior colleague from Louisiana, who worked so hard on expanding the IRA, I have heard many of our colleagues say that giving people money to spend is what it's about. I do believe people can make good choices about the way they spend their money. But I think the real need is to encourage people to save their money. Our savings rate in this country is much lower than it needs to be. If we can encourage people to save for the right things--to purchase a home, for catastrophic health care needs, for education to improve their productivity and to give hope to their children--that is really what this is about. 
I thank the members of the committee for fighting hard for expanding IRAs. It is important to people everywhere, and very important to people in Louisiana. 
Finally, just a word on the estate tax and small business and farmers. We believe, on this side of the aisle, and there are many on the other side who thought it was important, if a grandmother, grandfather, great-grandfather built a farm on the sweat of their brow, invested in their land, invested in their equipment, they should be able to pass that farm down to the next generation without having to sell off the land or sell off the equipment to pay the taxes to our Government. We heard that. We have responded, and we have now given a tax incentive to be able to pass those small businesses and farms on, to people in our country. 
Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to address the body, to say this is not a perfect bill but it is a very good step toward getting our fiscal house in order, to providing much-needed tax relief to hard-working, middle-class families in our country and to making the kind of investments that are going to make our country even stronger and more productive in the future. 
On behalf of the Meyers family, to the 236,000 children that will be able to benefit from health care, and to the almost 400,000 children that will be able to benefit from this tax credit, and for others, I thank you so much and I yield the floor.  
Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator makes a fine point, and I would like to add that the new communications system would also support inter-operability with most of the adjoining parishes and the city of New Orleans. This would mean expanded emergency capabilities throughout the region which are vital to the entire State of Louisiana.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office has demonstrated its commitment to this project by allocating over 50 percent of the cost of this initiative in a dedicated escrow account. In a competition for funds, the sheriff's office, with its well developed procurement strategy and available matching funds, would no doubt prevail as a deserving candidate.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I am happy to be here this morning to join my colleague from Washington State and so many of our colleagues to talk about the issues regarding this tax package and the budget that 
we are debating. 
I will be setting up in just a moment a picture of a family, Mr. President, from Shreveport, LA, the Meyers family. It is Lois and Scott Meyers, their son, Clayton, and Jessica, their daughter, who is 17. Their son Clayton is 5, the same age as my son Connor. This family works very hard, Mr. President. They only make, however, $17,000 a year. She, Mrs. Meyers, has a master's degree, but she works at a homeless shelter as a counselor. He has a $7-an-hour job. Of course, it is not full-time, but he also is a counselor and does not work a full 40 hours, but under contract has a flexible schedule. They are struggling hard to raise these two children. 
If we do not make this change that so many of us have talked about, expanding this $500 tax credit, this family in Louisiana, the Meyers family, and so many families like them in your State, in the State of Washington, in Texas, in South Carolina, will simply be left out. I believe, as so many of our colleagues do, that everyone in America, frankly, deserves a tax break. I really believe that, and I believe there are ways for us to provide tax breaks for those at the higher end, for those at the middle end, and for those working hard and struggling to make ends meet at the lower income levels. This family is not a welfare family. They are a hard-working, lower income family. 
In Louisiana, 95 percent of the people in my State--95 percent--make less than $75,000. Ninety-five percent of the households in Louisiana make less than $75,000. As their Senator, it is my job to argue that all of them, I believe, deserve some sort of tax relief. If we do not make this child credit stackable against the earned income tax credit, families like this, the Meyers family, will simply be left out. I just think that is not right. I believe they need to have tax relief. 
Now, this family, at $17,000 income, is frankly not going to be able to take much advantage of the capital gains tax relief, although I support capital gains tax relief. They are not going to take advantage of the estate tax relief. Their estate is not anywhere close to $600,000 in assets. They will be able to take advantage of, hopefully, the HOPE scholarship for Jessica as she gets ready to go into college, but if they don't get the $500 tax credit, they will not be a part of this tax plan. 
Now, it is true that they did only pay $200 in income tax last year because of the earned-income tax credit. They received a credit of about $1,200, but this family paid approximately $1,300 in payroll taxes, and that is what is important--for them to get this child tax credit against their payroll taxes, as well as the credit against the income tax. 
The President is fighting very hard, along with many, many of the Democrats. I hope some of the Republicans will join us in saying that we want tax relief for these families. 
In other States, the average schoolteacher salary, preschool and kindergarten teacher, is $18,700. The average sales occupation in America today is $24,000. Bookkeepers and accountants make on an average $20,000. Dental assistant, about $18,000. If this tax credit is not corrected in the way we believe it should be in conference, all of these families that I have mentioned--firefighters, bookkeepers, teachers, and this Meyers family--will not get the tax relief I think they deserve. 
I am here this morning to speak for them. They are not able to speak on this floor. They are only able to write letters and to call in. I am here this morning, along with many of my colleagues, to speak for these families, to say, `Let's make this tax package fair.' 
We also need, as you know, Mr. President, and so many of our colleagues, to make sure that we move toward a balanced budget, that we do it in a fair way, by giving tax relief broadly in the ways that we can, also cutting back where we can to make sure that we are running this Government in a very fiscally responsible way that promotes growth, that promotes job development, but also promotes fairness. 
When we can give a tax cut, let's give it to the families that deserve it. This is a hard-working family. They are not on welfare. They never have been on welfare, and they deserve a break today. 
Another subject of the tax bill that is important to me and so many on both sides of the aisle is the provision for a tax exemption for the State-sponsored savings plans. Florida has an extensive plan: 450,000 families have been able to join the Florida prepaid tuition plan. Senator Graham has been very supportive of this provision. 
In Louisiana, before I was elected to the Senate, as State treasurer I helped to institute a Start Smart plan, where families of all incomes up to $100,000--which includes just about everybody in Louisiana--would be able to set aside a small amount of money, as much as they were able to, sometimes as little at $10 a week, into a savings plan, and in our State, our general fund in Louisiana matches. For every $1 that a family is able to put up--it can be a parent, a guardian, a grandparent, a corporation can set up a savings plan for a child 
so they could go to college--whatever amount they are able to save, the State general fund matches that savings. For those at the lower income level, as the Meyers family, $18,000 to $20,000, the State makes a greater match, but the State gives some help or match to families making up to $100,000 on a progressive scale. 
The bottom line, in our conference, we have a possibility, which I understand the President supports--and I hope the American people will support this, too--to give tax-exempt status to those savings plans. We want more children, Mr. President, to be able to go to college. We want everyone to have the education they need to compete in a world very different than the world we grew up in. They need those technical skills. If they are not able to go to a 4-year college or a 2-year community college to at least get the technical training, post high school--12 years of education is no longer what is required. They need to go the extra 2 or 4 years to get the education they need to compete. Families need to be able to save. 
One of the other great provisions in this tax bill, but it is not a done deal yet, another great provision, which will cost about $1 billion, but it will be the best $1 billion we will ever spend, is leveraging the great will and great hope and great aspiration that families have to be able to have their children and grandchildren do better than themselves, to enable them to set up these savings accounts. I hope we will urge the President and urge the Republicans and Democrats to support this one provision in this tax bill that will make these savings plans tax exempt, encourage more States outside of Florida and Louisiana--and only a few others have set up these programs--urge them to set them up. 
This is supported by the National Treasurers Association, which has been a very strong advocate for this savings plan. This is not a handout, Mr. President. This is a handup. This says to families, if you are willing to set aside $10 a week or $50 a month or even $100 a month, we will match that effort, we will allow that fund to grow, tax exempt, so you will have that money. 
Mr. President, $500 a year, $17,000 a family would be able to save, almost $30,000 under a savings plan, even a modest savings plan, which is a good amount of money, actually a very large amount of money to be able to have that young person attend school. Also, this is for adults who set up in Louisiana this savings plan which allows them to go back to school to get the degree they need to have a higher salary and a more productive income level. 
So, besides the $500 tax credit that we on this side feel so strongly about making fair, this provision that allows and actually encourages families to save and increases the savings rate of America--which any economist and any person that is involved in the financial sector will tell you, America's savings rate is too low. It is not good for our country. 
So we do two things at once. We help families do the right thing by saving for their children. We also increase the savings rate for America, which helps our business to have more capital to invest. It is a win-win for everyone. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the change in the $500 child tax credit, as well as the provision for the statewide savings plans which would be so helpful to thousands, millions, of American families.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking my colleagues for their great patience. It has been a long day. I thank our ranking member for his great attention to this matter. 
I also want to thank Senators Kerry, Johnson, and Durbin for joining me in cosponsoring this amendment. 
Mr. President, this amendment would allow the $500 child tax credit that we have talked so much about in the last few days to be available to 20 million families in America that are working very hard. 
Mr. President, under the current draft of the bill, these working families only get to keep about half of this credit. In my State that means 27 percent of the families in my State who are working very hard will not be able to keep the full amount of this credit. 
I know this has been considered carefully. But I feel compelled to offer this amendment today. I know that in this bill we are giving tax relief to many Americans. I believe that these Americans should have the opportunity to keep the full $500 tax credit. I ask my colleagues to give favorable consideration. It is budget neutral.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem and support the resolution offered by my distinguished colleagues from New York and Florida in marking this auspicious occasion. Psalm 122 admonishes us to `pray for the peace of Jerusalem.' This biblical verse is as apt now, on the 30th anniversary of the Holy City's reunification, as it was 3,000, years ago. 
Jerusalem knew little peace in the 19 years before 1967. The end of Israel's War of Independence left an obscene no-man's land of barbed wire, tank traps, sniper posts, and minefields. Israel's former adversary left almost no vestige of Jewish history in the historic old city untouched, including the destruction of 58 synagogues; Jewish gravestones from the Mount of Olives were used to build roads and latrines for occupying troops. 
Mr. President, Israel's foes had as much regard for the rights of religious pilgrims as they did for religious sites: Jews could not visit the Western Wall, and Israeli Muslims were denied access to the Dome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa Mosque. During the occupation, the Christian population of Jerusalem declined from 25,000 to 10,000. 
On the morning of June 7, 1967, our entire world changed. Israeli commandos stormed through St. Stephen's Gate on the northeast side of the old city walls and took control over the old city and its centerpiece, the Temple Mount. They discovered that occupying troops had used the Temple Mount area, including the Dome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa mosque, as a huge ammunition dump. Mr. President, what might have happened if the ammunition would have exploded, destroying the Temple Mount and perhaps the nearby Church of the Holy Sepulcher? How great would our spiritual loss have been? 
For the first time since the Romans leveled the city in AD 70, Jews controlled the Western Wall--the surviving remnant of Herod's Temple. 
Mr. President, shortly after the end of the Six Day War, Israel did something astonishing for a victorious power. Israeli officials assured Arab leaders that the Muslims would keep control of the Islamic holy places on the Temple Mount. That inspired decision began Jerusalem on the road to reunification and began to heal the wounds of centuries. 
Mr. President, I traveled to Israel with my father when I was 21 and saw a city transformed from that which had seen pain and anguish for thousands of years. Where barbed wire and armed soldiers had once stood was a magnificent area of trees and grass that now surrounds the renovated walls of the old city. I saw a rebuilt Jewish Quarter in the old city. But Mr. President, most importantly, I saw for myself that free and open access to their holy places for people of all faiths was not merely the goal in Jerusalem, it was the rule. 
The city's parks were revitalized. Schools and museums and hospitals sprang up. Music and poetry once again rose into Israel's evening sky. The people came together as artists, architects, lawyers, and theologians in an effort that resulted in a city that no longer just survived but lived and breathed. The Talmud proclaims that `of the 10 measures of beauty that came down to the world, Jerusalem took nine.' Mr. President, for the first time since those prophetic words were first formed, those `measures of beauty' saw the light of day. 
Mr. President, the question that those brave, industrious people tried to answer is one that we still ask today: How can Jerusalem, which means `city of peace,' an ancient symbol of humanity's aspirations for redemption, become a living city that does not betray the promise of its name? An answer tragically eludes us, still today, 30 years after Jerusalem's reunification. 
The United States Congress has a long-standing commitment to a united Jerusalem governed by Israel. Seven years ago, Congress declared that Jerusalem `must remain an undivided city' and the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 unequivocally stated that Jerusalem should remain the undivided capital of Israel as a matter of U.S. policy. The resolution introduced by my friends Senator Moynihan and Senator Mack clearly expresses our conviction that it should be so. 
Mr. President, it is said that `one prayer in Jerusalem is worth 40,000 elsewhere.' This resolution offers the voice of Congress to those voices coming from all over our Nation and the world praying for peace and prosperity for this most special city of all cities on this truly important day. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Madam President. To my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts who has been such a strong and solid voice for working families and working people throughout this country, I appreciate his help on this issue. 
I am here today with my colleagues, Senator Baucus and Senator Kerrey, to offer some thoughts as to how we can make this particular bill more meaningful to working families. 
There is an architect, Bill McCuen, in South Carolina who is now running for Congress. He recently changed his political affiliation from the GOP to the Democratic Party. Mr. McCuen has suggested that the national GOP is `substituting rhetoric for wisdom and * * * building walls instead of opening windows.' With all due respect to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I have concluded that Mr. McCuen's analysis is applicable in this instance. Perhaps he has had an opportunity to study S. 4. 
This bill, in its current form, is not about families nor is it friendly. The issue before us today is about workplace fairness. The bill is harmful to families in its current form. Our distinguished majority leader says S. 4 provides much-needed flexibility to workers. But Madam President, this measure is not about giving flexibility to workers; this bill is about flexibility only to employers or bosses. The 40-hour work week and the protections it affords have been in place since 1938. Under S. 4, these protections are clearly abolished. I believe that as Members of this body we have a real obligation to create truly family-friendly legislation as opposed to the proposal being offered by the majority. 
There has also been a lot said Madam President about this bill helping women who are now working more than ever before. Today, 60 percent of mothers with young children are in the workplace. 
This bill does not offer any relief for mothers to spend more time with their children or to meet necessary family obligations. 
Madam President, this bill neither makes for a better workplace nor is it family friendly. This legislation is merely a comptime scheme that will hurt the hard-working families of America--it will cut their pay, decrease their benefits and pensions, and threaten their long-term plans. 
It will take decisions that should be made by a worker and give them to an employer and it abolishes a standard that this Nation has abided by for the last 60 years--the 40-hour work week. 
Madam President, my Democratic colleagues want real flexibility and choice that will protect the working families of this country. We Democrats understand and support the desire employees have for more flexibility between work and family. Democrats fought for an increase in the minimum wage and the Family and Medical Leave Act so that workers would not have to choose between serving their family and serving their employer. Between taking their child to the doctor or getting to work on time. 
However, we also recognize that we need to have innovative arrangements in the workplace so that both employers and employees can be sure that their basic interests are protected. Madam President, the Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu alternative would provide this real flexibility to working families because: Employees could decide when to accept overtime pay and when to accept comp time; employees could decide when to use their comptime; health and pension benefits for workers would be protected; and the 40-hour work week would be preserved. 
Madam President, the legislation that my distinguished Republican colleagues have introduced is wrong for working families and would be harmful to the continued economic success of this Nation because it does not offer workers any flexibility in meeting their obligations to their families and fulfilling their duties to their employers. 
Instead, S. 4 gives employees less control over both their time and their paychecks. Critical decisions that affect time spent at work, time spent at home, vacation, sick leave, and compensation are all in the hands of the employer instead of where they belong--with the employee.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, the bipartisan budget agreement as amended during the debate of the past few days. Mr. President, I believe that the Budget Resolution represents an important victory for this body and for the American people in that we can finally look forward to a balanced budget by 2002. Priorities like Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment have been protected. This agreement, the first true balanced budget in 28 years, delivers on a personal promise of mine to work to strengthen the economy, balance the budget and put families first. 
Mr. President, I salute the work of both parties as the primary reason this agreement was reached. Each side had to give and take to get us to this point. I commend the President and the congressional leadership, particularly Senator Domenici and Senator Lautenberg, for their responsible conduct throughout this entire process. We are in their debt. 
Mr. President, the budget agreement puts more resources into educating America's children--from Head Start to college--than the Federal government has done in 30 years. It secures Medicare's solvency for a decade, cleans up poisonous waste sites and will help move millions of Americans from welfare to work. Just as important, it accomplishes all this and gives needed tax relief to hard-working families and small businesses through capital gains and estate tax cuts and a $500 per child tax credit. 
Mr. President, this agreement only begins our work, it doesn't end it. I will go forward with my colleagues fighting for families--to strengthen our investment in children by repairing their crumbling schools, extending medical coverage to more children, and cutting juvenile crime--and to strengthen Social Security and make retirement secure for every working American.

Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. I begin by thanking my distinguished colleague from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, for his hard work and excellent work. He has been working for months, talking with medical doctors, advocates for children and families, and affected women to try to help us arrive at a balanced approach, that will resolve this very difficult of issues. 
To my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, who just spoke, I say that I am here today because I want to join with you in ending late-term abortions. The young woman about whom the Senator spoke so beautifully, would have a chance to live under our amendment because it will ban all procedures except in the very rarest of circumstances. With due respect, under the bill that the gentleman is supporting, that wonderful child could still be aborted, because the mother would still be free to choose another procedure. 
My colleagues on the opposite side continue to make reference to a Dr. Hern. I want to say again that when this bill passes, he will lose his license. He will not be able to practice. 
My distinguished colleague from New Hampshire has made the excellent argument for the minority of people in this country who believe that abortion should be banned at all times, in every circumstance, in every case, but the majority of Americans in my State of Louisiana and in this country want reason. They want to abide by the Constitution which gives the woman the right to terminate a pregnancy in the early stages, but they want most certainly to ban and prohibit late-term abortions. That is what this amendment does. 
We have heard all day about one or two doctors that might say they would never perform a late-term abortion. That is their right under the law. But the American Medical Association, 37,000 strong, has said, and I want to quote again for the debate:  
In recognition of the constitutional principles regarding the right to an abortion articulated by the Supreme Court and in keeping with the science and values of medicine, the AMA recommends that abortions not be performed in the third trimester except in the cases of serious fetal abnormalities, incompatible with life. Although third-trimester abortions can be performed to preserve the life or health of the mother, they are in fact generally not necessary for those purposes except in the most extraordinary circumstances. 
That is what my distinguished colleague from South Dakota along with the two Senators from Maine, have tried to craft, a very narrow health exception with tight restrictive language. 
Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Snowe-Daschle amendment to Senate Bill 6. 
Mr. President, the distinguished Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote: 
Great concepts like liberty were purposely left to gather meaning from experience. For they relate to the whole domain of social and economic fact, and the statesmen who founded this nation knew too well that only a stagnant society remains unchanged. 
We are not a stagnant society and changes in reality and our perceptions have brought us here today. It has been nearly 25 years since the Supreme Court decided Roe versus Wade. The Roe decision encompassed a lot of the experience and wisdom that our nation had acquired regarding personal liberty. In 1973, it affirmed the new understanding that Americans had developed about the role of women in society and the role of government in our personal lives. 
However, 25 years after Roe, our country has had more time to reflect on its experiences. Social and economic factors have altered the world in which we live. Breakthroughs in medicine have changed our understanding of human development and have allowed us to deliver premature babies at ages never before possible. We have reached the appropriate time to review our definition of liberty in the context of a woman's right to end a pregnancy. 
Those of us who support Roe versus Wade understand this was not a decision which allowed for abortion on demand, but rather it was a decision which balanced the rights of privacy and liberty on one hand--and State's authority to protect prenatal life on the other. In writing his decision, Justice Blackmun clearly stated: 
A state may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life. At some point in the pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision. 
One of the questions we face today is what is the approximate point at which prenatal life becomes sufficiently compelling and what are the appropriate regulations to the termination of pregnancy. 
In reviewing both Roe and Casey, it is clear that the Court has given us one sure point on which to balance individual liberty and prenatal life. That point is viability. Before a fetus is viable, the rights of privacy and personal liberty found in the Constitution require us to provide safe and accessible method to terminate a pregnancy. After viability, the State's interest in prenatal life should prevail. Our first woman on the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor, framed the delicate balance our society has reached in the Casey decision when she stated: 
While [Roe] has engendered disapproval, it has not been unworkable. An entire generation has come of age, free to assume Roe's concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions . . . and no changes of fact have rendered viability more or less appropriate as the point at which the balance of interests tips. 
Viability presents a bright line--a legal standard--that we can use to govern our decisions about regulating abortion. 
Mr. Santorum's bill violates the viability standard and does nothing to end late-term abortion. On the other hand, Mr. President, Senator Daschle and Senator Snowe's alternative method would indeed make clear that all late-term abortions by any procedure are prohibited. I thank them for their leadership in bringing this alternative to the floor. They have both displayed a willingness to reach across the aisle and provide us with a bill which reflects the consensus that the American people have already reached. 
A 1996 Gallup Poll indicated that 64 percent of Americans support a woman's right to have an abortion during the first 3 months of pregnancy. This is a strong indication of a national consensus that abortion should be an available, legal, and safe option for women in the early stages of pregnancy. 
When you ask those same people how they feel about abortions in the third trimester, the consensus flips the other way. Only 13 percent of those surveyed supported abortion, 82 percent would prohibit it. Those 82 percent of the people who oppose abortion in the third trimester are not just opposed to a particular procedure; they are opposed to all procedures. They believe that once a fetus reaches the point where it could sustain meaningful life, they are opposed to abortion. 
That is precisely what is accomplished by the Snowe-Daschle amendment. We make clear, with appropriate penalties, that late-term abortion by any procedure 
will not be allowed, except in the rare and extraordinary circumstances when a woman's life or physical health is gravely threatened. Yes, a doctor would certify the viability and health risk to the mother, but who else would be qualified to make such medical decisions? The local judge or city council? 
Without this amendment, S. 6 would accomplish very little. The partial birth abortion ban concentrates on banning only one procedure, it does nothing to stop late-term abortions. What possible good is accomplished by bringing this very heart-wrenching subject before the Congress and the American people, only to pass a bill that does not affect abortions? As written, this bill is simply an opportunity for people to congratulate themselves on having done something important, when in fact they have accomplished nothing. If we pass S. 6 unamended, it would be like outlawing armed robbery with an Uzi, but allowing criminals to hold you up with a handgun. The American people will see through this facade and be even more disillusioned with this institution and its members. 
Maybe the most significant advantage of the Snowe-Daschle amendment is that it can be passed, signed by the President and will meet constitutional scrutiny. The bipartisan approach of this amendment is our best chance to address post-viability abortions, while also preserving our understanding of liberty in the 25 years since Roe versus Wade. 
I would be remiss if I did not add that when the government acts to restrict abortions, as is its right in certain circumstances, it has an increased obligation to make the choice to support life more compelling. We cannot on one hand require women to forego the option of abortion and at the same time undermine all the programs that support a woman as she struggles to bring a child into the world. Since the Roe decision, a number of steps have been taken to make abortion safer and more accessible. We need to act affirmatively to make abortion more rare and less necessary. We can do that by vigorously supporting pregnancy prevention strategies that would minimize or preclude the need for abortion. 
A key component of this effort must be adoption. This Nation needs to make adoption more affordable through tax credits and Congress should work to implement State and Federal laws and regulations that encourage families to build through adoption. 
We must continue to reform our foster-care system to make permanent placement for children a reality and a loving family for every child an achievable goal. 
We should invest more in prenatal care and health insurance for our children so that young mothers deliver healthy babies, taxpayers save money, and children have a real chance at a decent life. 
We ought to concentrate on effective pregnancy prevention efforts in our schools. Our children need to understand the serious ramifications of sex outside of marriage so that we are faced with fewer unplanned pregnancies. We have had years of experience with sex education programs in this country. We should, state-by-state, replicate those successful programs nationwide. 
It is important that we in the Congress and in this Chamber understand that a commitment to life means more than just talk. In a time of tight budgets, the true test of peoples' priorities is where they are willing to commit scarce resources. We can all agree that we should make every effort to preserve human life. However, it is a hollow promise to bring life into the world and then abandon it when it arrives. If life is a priority for this Congress, we should reflect it by making our policies and pocketbooks available to nurture young lives. 
Mr. President, the debate surrounding late-term abortions has been a valuable opportunity for the American people to take stock of what we mean by liberty. I believe that the Snowe-Daschle amendment is an excellent reflection of what our experience has taught us since Roe. It restores a balance to our national dialogue about abortion and premises it upon the clear standard of viability. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
Thank you very much.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we have engaged in this debate on the nation's strategy to deal with temporary storage of high-level nuclear waste, I have come to several conclusions. Certainly storage is a troublesome issue that has remained unresolved for the past 16 years. As time has gone by, it has become clearer and clearer that the Nation needs a more comprehensive strategy, not a piecemeal strategy, to handle all the issues associated with long-term storage of nuclear waste. Furthermore, given the vehemently strong opinions expressed by citizens, administrators, State and local officials, and others who would be affected by a centralized storage plan, I believe we need to have the utmost confidence in the way we choose to dispose of spent fuel. 
When we began to consider the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, I was optimistic about our ability to work toward the common goal of providing guidance on this issue. Supporters of the bill made an extremely credible case to me that something needs to be done. The Nuclear Waste Act of 1982 set up a trust fund to help pay for the cost of a permanent geologic repository. As part of the deal, the Department of Energy was directed to contract with utilities to accept spent fuel at a permanent repository by 1998, but now it cannot. The Nation's nuclear reactors have begun to run out of space for spent fuel in pools at reactor sites. Soon, more and more utilities will have to build above ground storage casks. I am sympathetic to the frustrations expressed by State governments and utilities over this breach. I am sure many of my colleagues agree with me. 
Another issue that demands attention is the Nuclear Waste Fund. Congress has established 172 trust funds financed by taxpayers for specific purposes. Few have maintained their integrity in the spending process. The Nuclear Waste Fund is one of the few where the Government entered into an actual contract to perform a duty--to take on spent nuclear fuel by a time certain. Considering the history of this issue, I am opposed to the idea that ratepayers, who have already contributed over $12 billion to the Nuclear Waste Fund for the construction of a permanent repository, should also have the cost of on-site storage passed on to them. Louisianians have paid over $140 million into this fund since 1982, with no results. This is unacceptable. The public should be getting its money's worth. Otherwise, the money should not be spent. 
Conversely, and most importantly, I am hesitant to commit to the construction of an interim storage facility if there are uncertainties associated with the designated permanent repository site. So much rests on a decision to place an interim site near Yucca Mountain. Will we transport the waste more than once if Yucca Mountain is unsuitable? How wise is it to ignore 
this possible outcome? This body several years ago requested a study from the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. Their findings were illustrative of the complexity of this effort. It seems that a particular element was found in the exploratory tunnel at Yucca Mountain. This element is generally present when there is fast flowing water in a location. No one expected this finding. Nor did anyone expect the Board to determine that utilities could go on safely storing nuclear waste at reactor sites for another decade. Both these findings show that certainties are hard to come by, even when from all indications, a clear outcome is expected. Mr. President, we should not create a nuclear waste policy based on incomplete information. This issue is just too important. 
For these reasons, I am unable at this time to support S. 104. I believe that the rationale for a comprehensive approach to waste storage is evident. The working process I have witnessed over the last few weeks between the leaders on this issue, if continued, could result in a measure that addresses all of the concerns raised by industry, State and local administrators including tribes, and the administration. I have felt for some time that a compromise on the provisions of S. 104 exists. In fact, a compromise was nearly achieved. 
Mr. President, it is said that a rolling stone gathers no moss. I submit that we cannot afford to let moss grow. We need to adopt a clear policy sooner rather than later on this question. I am disappointed that compromise could not be found at this time, but I urge my colleagues to continue to work on finding solutions so that we can have a sensible nuclear waste policy for this Nation. 
In closing I will say that permanent storage of nuclear waste is something that we need to do--we need to do it once and only once. It is of paramount importance that it be done correctly and to the satisfaction of all.

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I believe that we should adopt a capital budget and I strongly urge its incorporation into Senate Joint Resolution 1. This amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, establishes a capital budget and should receive the support of every Member of this Chamber who truly wants to see a balanced budget become a reality. A capital budget will help us achieve that end and will bring more financial accountability to the Federal level. 
Many supporters of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution believe that the Federal Government should manage its funds like many hard-working families across our Nation. Families must balance their checkbooks or they face serious financial consequences. Why, amendment supporters ask, should the Federal Government be any different? 
The reason is clear, Mr. President. Families do not balance their budgets, they balance their checkbooks. They sit at the kitchen table once or twice a month to make sure that there is enough money to pay the bills. However, not all of their expenses are paid in full at the time they are purchased. Most Americans can only afford such items if they spread their payment obligations over a longer period of time, sometimes with the help of loans. People do not receive the benefits of such expenditures at one time, either--they drive their cars and live in their homes for years, perhaps decades. 
Most States operate in the same manner. While almost every State has some type of constitutional or statutory requirement to balance their budgets, such limitations normally apply to a state's operating budget--like a family's checkbook. State expenses for constructing such items as roads and buildings or purchasing land do not fall within the balanced budget requirements. 
The Federal Government, however, is being asked to balance its budget without a distinction between capital outlays and operating expenses. In fact, were the balanced budget amendment to pass without providing for the establishment of a capital budget, this country would place upon itself a restriction not followed by families, businesses or States. Furthermore, such a limitation would make the United States unique among the major economic powers in the world--not a single nation among the G-7 has such budget constraints. 
Federal outlays for capital investments are significantly different from outlays for operating expenses because they represent asset exchanges. When the United States spends money to purchase a building or land, the United States receives an appreciable asset in exchange for that expense. That asset will produce future streams of revenue to the United States either through the increase in the value of the property or simply as a place to conduct the Government's business. Such expenditures do not contribute to the deficit wholly because the resulting purchase or investment leaves the Government with calculations on both sides of the ledger. 
Additionally, a lack of such a distinction is an inadequate way for the Government to manage the Nation's funds. To use the example provided by Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist who served in both the Reagan and Bush administrations, a `$10 million building that will last 30 years must be fully accounted for in a single year's budget, the same as a $10 million outlay for airplane fuel or some other operating expense.' In Mr. Bartlett's view, in my own view, and in the opinion of hundreds of economists nationwide, `the lack of a [Federal] capital budget creates biases in the budget that lead to uneconomical decisions.'

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today is indeed a historic milestone for our Nation. For the majority of this country's history, a full half of our citizens were left without the right to vote therefore they were left without a voice, without a collective voice in the direction of domestic affairs or international affairs for our country. 
With the passage of the 19th amendment in 1920, this flawed policy was corrected, however since that time progress and change in this area has come, but very slowly. Today we take a great step forward for our country and the world in approving the nomination of Secretary of State designee Madeleine Albright. 
Although there is little controversy surrounding our vote today on this confirmation we should take a moment to note the historical significance of this occasion. 
There was a time not long ago when the nomination of any woman regardless of how qualified or experienced to lead our Nation's foreign policy would have been at the least controversial, and at the most unthinkable. Today, that time is over. 
Ambassador Albright's confirmation is all but certain in just a few moments with the vote of this Senate. She is a tribute to her gender, but it is not to her gender that this accomplishment is due, it is through her exemplary career in foreign service. 
To be here today on the floor of this historic Chamber to cast my first vote as a U.S. Senator is in itself a exhilarating experience, but to be able to cast that vote for Madeleine Albright the first woman ever to serve as Secretary of State of this great Nation makes it even more memorable. 
Thank you Mr. President for the opportunity to share these thoughts.
