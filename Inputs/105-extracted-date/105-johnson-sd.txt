Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I voted today for the omnibus appropriations bill that was pending before the Senate, in large part because, very frankly, of my great doubt that delaying what already has been an utterly abominable legislative process would, at this late point, improve the nature of the final product. 
It should be abundantly clear to us all, to even the most casual observers, that the first and most fundamental mistake made by this 105th Congress was the unwillingness, or perhaps the inability, of the Republican leadership to craft a budget resolution acceptable to a majority of Members of both parties. But, amazingly, the Republican leadership was then unable or unwilling to put together a budget resolution that could even muster the majority support of its own party. As a result, for the very first time since the current Budget Act was enacted, Congress was forced to proceed on with the 13 separate appropriations bills without the benefit of the direction of a budget resolution at all. 
In fairness, this body did pass its own version of a budget resolution, and much of the difficulty in reaching an agreement with the other body lies with the radical faction in the House, which was unwilling to support any measure unless it called for huge tax reductions funded out of a naked raid on the Social Security surplus. There were a few Members of this body as well who indicated they could not vote for a final resolution unless a tax cut/Social Security plunder plan was involved. So, April 15, the deadline for passage of a budget resolution, came and it went, and in the end no agreement was reached between the Senate and the other body and no serious effort at bipartisanship, frankly, was ever attempted. The budget process that has ensued, and we have witnessed its culmination today, is certainly a case of the Republican leadership having to reap what it sowed. 
Without the discipline of a budget resolution, this Congress then proceeded to make an utter mockery of the appropriations process. 
Rather than deliberate debate and careful consideration of the 13 separate appropriations bills needed to run the Federal Government, we wound up with an omnibus appropriations bill weighing some 40 pounds and going on for 3,825 pages as it compressed 8 of the appropriations bills, a supplemental appropriations bill, and miscellaneous matters all into one ill-considered mess. The bill we have had before us today is a consequence of massive, massive legislative mismanagement. 
All this is not to say that the legislation that was before this body today did not have some redeeming strengths. There will be no Federal Government shutdown, and as the American people rightfully celebrate the first balanced unified Federal budget in 30 years, the omnibus bill does stay within the previously agreed upon budget caps. Thanks to President Clinton and his earlier veto, this legislation does provide for significant assistance for farmers and ranchers suffering through an economic crisis throughout much of rural America and, again, thanks to the President's tenacity, this bill will provide for the hiring of additional teachers and the expansion of some key educational programs, such as Head Start. 
But even here, the omnibus bill is not as good as it ought to have been. The agricultural provisions failed to address the underlying problem of inadequate market prices for livestock and grain by neglecting to raise the marketing loan rates, and by eliminating price reporting and country of origin meat labeling, it does next to nothing for livestock producers. 
The educational provisions are inadequate in several areas, but most noticeably, the Republican leadership refused to permit a Federal-State-local partnership which would have allowed the cost of school construction and renovation bonds to have been significantly reduced for local taxpayers. 
To this Senator, it is simply outrageous for some on the far political right to claim, as they have, that this commonsense provision would have amounted to some sort of `federalization' of education. Clearly, the decisions as to whether to build or renovate a school would have remained at the local level, where such decisions belong, and the bulk of funding for such construction would likewise have remained appropriately enough with local taxpayers. 
Mr. President, it is not federalization for the Federal Government to help local citizens reduce the cost of their education decisions, decisions that they make at the local level, by partially writing down interest rates on the bonds which these school districts would then have to issue. 
There are some who are referring, with some justification, to the 105th Congress as the worst that has ever met in this Capitol Building. I don't know if that is true, but the mismanagement of this legislation, coupled with the refusal of the majority leader to even allow meaningful debate and progress on such issues as managed health care reform, campaign finance reform, and modernization of financial services, among others, ought to be a source of shame for this institution. 
Again, Mr. President, while some have voted against the omnibus bill as a protest gesture, motivated by any number of concerns, I wanted to do the responsible thing, and I voted to pass this faulty but, frankly, at this point in time very necessary legislation. It is my hope, however, that never again will Congress proceed without a budget resolution and without an opportunity to debate and deliberate on individual appropriations bills in a timely manner.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on October 2, 1998, South Dakotans honored one of their veterans with the dedication of the Michael J. Fitzmaurice State Veterans Home in Hot Springs. I believe this is a fitting tribute to a man who was willing to sacrifice his own life to defend the lives of his friends amidst the chaos of battle. 
Michael Fitzmaurice served in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne Division at Khe Sanh. On March 13, 1971, American forces at Khe Sanh were engaged by North Vietnamese troops. During the assault, North Vietnamese sappers threw three satchel charges into a bunker defended by Michael and other airborne troops. Michael Fitzmaurice was able to throw two of the explosive charges out of the bunker, and then showing no regard for his own life, used his flak jacket to smother the third charge. Despite receiving severe wounds, Michael Fitzmaurice refused medical attention and continued to defend the bunker from the North Vietnamese assault. Because of his unselfish action, Michael was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroism and for saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. 
Today, Michael Fitzmaurice works at the Sioux Falls Veterans Medical Center after serving twenty years with the South Dakota National Guard. He now lives in Hartford, South Dakota with his wife Patty and his children. The veterans home dedicated in Michael's honor will serve as a residence for veterans who saw combat. The facility also has a nursing home and a place where veterans can receive needed medical attention. 
From the battlefields of Lexington and Concord, to the beaches of Normandy, and to base camps such as Khe Sanh, our nation's history is replete with individuals who, during the savagery of battle, were willing to forgo their own survival not only to protect the lives of their comrades, but also to defend a people they did not know. Americans should never forget these men and women who served our nation with such dedication and patriotism. 
Mr. President, I offer my congratulations and gratitude to Michael and his family on this profound dedication. The Michael J. Fitzmaurice State Veterans Home will stand not only as a testament to Michael Fitzmaurice's bravery and leadership, but will remain a constant reminder of South Dakota's continued dedication in serving the needs of our veterans.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take the opportunity today to recognize the kind and generous people of western Massachusetts who donated exercise equipment to the Cheyenne River Reservation community in my home state of South Dakota. 
The participating YMCA's of Greenfield, Springfield, Holyoke, Northampton and Westfield Massachusetts organized a month long drive that collected 80 pieces of exercise equipment ranging from treadmills to exercise bikes. Robert Sunderland, Vincent Olinski, Harry Rock, Suzanne Walker, Stephen Clay, Kurt Kramer, and Mark St. Pierre all worked together to make this project a reality. Their vision, tireless dedication, and proactive efforts to mobilize the people of western Massachusetts should not go unnoticed. Additionally, I would like to recognize Keith Eichenholz of my staff, a native of Greenfield Massachusetts himself, for recognizing the effort of these participating YMCAs, as well as the needs of Indian country in South Dakota. 
As my Senate colleagues know, there are nine federally recognized tribes in South Dakota, whose members collectively make up one of the largest Native American populations in this country. At the same time, South Dakota has three of the ten poorest counties in the nation, all of which are within reservation boundaries. The severe poverty within these reservations makes it extremely difficult to secure valuable resources that can be used to fight the grave health situation plaguing the American Indian communities. 
The contributions of the western Massachusetts YMCAs will help overcome these alarming conditions. Native Americans die at younger ages than the general population: 13 percent of Indian deaths, compared to 4 percent of deaths for all races, occur before age 25. Tuberculosis as a cause of death for Native Americans is 4 times the national mortality rate for this disease, and the Native American mortality rate for diabetes out-paces the national average by 139 percent. Additionally, a 1997 Harvard/Centers for Disease Control study on life expectancy found that the lowest life expectancy in the nation for both men and women, including inner city populations, exists in the Indian population and are the worst rates of any nation in the western hemisphere except Haiti. American health care and medical science are far too advanced to allow such statistics to persist. 
Time and time again, regular exercise has been proven effective in reducing the occurrence of heart disease, diabetes, and early deaths. The five western Massachusetts communities will help provide the Cheyenne River Reservation community with the opportunity for a healthier lifestyle at practically no cost. Their contribution deserves recognition, and I thank them for all of their help. 
Throughout my service in Congress I have worked with Indian tribes to improve the quality of life on this nation's Indian reservations. I am glad that I have the generous people of Greenfield, Springfield, Holyoke, Northampton and Westfield Massachusetts as allies is this courageous effort. 
Again, I would like to offer my sincere gratitude for their collaborated effort, and wish them continued success in future endeavors.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the Surface Transportation Board (STB) was established in 1996 by act of Congress as a quasi-independent body within the Department of Transportation. The STB adjudicates disputes and regulates interstate surface transportation including the restructuring of railroad lines. 
Although the authorization of the STB expired this year, a reauthorization bill has not been scheduled. It was my intention to offer an amendment to the reauthorization relating to railroad lines, or at least engage in a colloquy with the manager of the bill. However, because no amendments, or even colloquies, will be agreed to by the managers of the reauthorization of the STB, I offer these comments for the record. 
It is my understanding that under section 10901 of title 49 of the U.S. Code, relating to the construction and operation of railroad lines, the STB is required to issue a certificate authorizing the construction or extension of a railroad line, unless it finds that such activity is `inconsistent with the public convenience and necessity.' 
Because the construction of railroad lines can cause significant adverse environmental impacts such as noise, safety and quality of life on local communities, my amendment would have sought to direct the STB to require applicants for the construction or extension of railroad lines to use all reasonable means to route them away from population centers in compliance with the above provision. 
Although I am disappointed that I will not be able to offer my amendment, I have been assured by the Chairman of the Surface Transportation Board that `regardless of whether or not language is inserted into our reauthorization bill, the Board must, and will, consider local interests in assessing the DM&E construction case.' 
Mr. President, I appreciate Chairman Morgan's assurances, and I look forward to working with the STB on this and other issues in the next Congress.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I introduce common-sense legislation which will greatly benefit America's manufacturers and consumers. My colleague, Senator DeWine of Ohio, is joining me as an original cosponsor of this bill. The `Made In America' Consumer Hotline bill will establish a toll free number in the Department of Commerce to assist consumers in determining whether the products they buy are American-made. The House has passed this legislation and I urge my colleagues to move this bill swiftly in our remaining days of the Congress. 
As the world economy becomes more inter-related, determining to what extent a product is `Made in America' is increasingly difficult for American consumers. We have come to expect access to information about so many of the products and services we rely on every day, information to help us make decisions about what's best for our families, our communities and our economy. With auto parts, computers, clothing, or appliances, American consumers know that the `Made in America' designation on products represents quality, reliability, and value. 
This legislation would establish a pilot program for the operation of a three-year, toll-free number to assist consumers in determining what products are `Made in America.' This legislation will have no cost to American taxpayers. Instead, fees collected from manufacturers who voluntarily choose to register their product will fully fund the toll-free line. In the past, I cosponsored this hotline legislation in the House and I applaud my House colleagues for passing this bill. 
Providing consumers access to accurate and reliable information on the content of the products they buy is common-sense legislation that is long overdue. Some may object to the creation of such an information hotline as a protectionist endeavor. On the contrary, I believe there is nothing more conducive to fair trade than providing consumers the freedom to decide what product is best for them. This legislation is not about telling consumers what to buy, it's about providing consumers the resources they need to make their own decisions. 
I have worked hard to advance the issue of freedom of information on country of origin labeling, but we need to do more to facilitate consumer access to information. As you and I know, we can easily determine which country manufactured the automobiles we drive. We trust the tags on our shirts or trousers and we can see where our computers, stereos, and telephones were made by simply looking at the products' label. But many areas remain void of information on product origin. For example, when we go to the grocery store to purchase meat products for our families to eat, we have no idea where that meat originated. 
Throughout my service in the United States Congress, I have been a strong believer in country of origin labeling for all types of consumer products. I have been an especially strong supporter of country of origin labeling for meat products because of its common-sense nature, its benefits to ranchers, farmers, and consumers, its strong bipartisan and agricultural group support, its cost-free benefit to taxpayers as scored by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and its trade friendly provisions. I don't intend to stop at agricultural products. The legislation I am introducing today targets general consumer products greater than $250 in value. 
Freedom of information about country of origin labeling is fair trade because it provides global consumers with freedom of choice. In today's global economy, consumers deserve access to information on where the products their families use are from. By passing this `Made in America' toll-free hotline legislation, Congress will help consumers assert their right to know.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I rise to express--in very stark terms--my deep and increasing concern for the future of family farming and ranching in this country. The truth is, our country's family farmers and ranchers are under increasing economic pressure from concentration in agriculture--concentration in meatpacking, concentration in food-retailing, concentration in rail and other forms of transportation, concentration in banking, concentration in the grain-trading companies, and concentration in production itself. 
The strands of these varied concentrations are tightening around the throats of family farmers and ranchers, threatening not only the farmers and ranchers themselves, but also their families, the small-town businesses that depend on them, their schools, their churches, and the very social fabric that makes rural America such a special and wonderful place to live--the reasons why we should do whatever we can to preserve and promote our system of family farming and ranching. 
But there is more at stake here than just our farmers and ranchers and their families, critically important as they are. What's also at stake is the very system that produces our food, that gives us life. Study after study shows that family agriculture is the most efficient way, the most environmentally safe way, to produce our food. And that is another reason why we should do whatever we can to preserve and promote our system of family farming and ranching. 
But, frankly, there is a troubling movement in our country toward the corporatization of family agriculture. Look at the pork industry--it has become increasingly dominated by giant corporate hog factories, a fact which has gone hand-in-glove with lower and lower prices for hogs, to the point that many family pork producers can't make a living at it anymore, and have simply given up. 
A case in point is the state of North Carolina, which has seen the biggest influx of corporate hog factories in the United States. In 1984, there were 24,000 hog farmers in that state, just before the growth of hog factories skyrocketed. Now, there are 7,000 hog farmers in North Carolina, almost all of them working on contract, little more than hired hands working for outside corporate investors. However, at the same time that independent family hog producers have almost disappeared in North Carolina, the number of hogs produced there has tripled, thus leading to enormous environmental problems--fish kills numbering in the tens of millions, rapidly rising nitrates in groundwater used for drinking, increasing levels in airborne ammonia, stench that makes the eyes water, and a corresponding and unsurprising drop in tourism. The North Carolina experiment has clearly not worked. 
What has happened in North Carolina, and what is happening in many other states, is nothing less than a human tragedy. My ancestors, and the ancestors of many people here today, left Europe to escape the feudal system of agriculture, a system of inequality and unfairness where a baron controlled the land and the peasants worked for him as little better than slaves. 
I do not want to return to a `new feudalism' in which the baron is replaced by out-of-state corporate investors, nor do I believe that the people of my state desire to do so, either. It is for that reason that I have opposed the concentration in agriculture at all levels, because it ultimately is fair to neither food producers nor food consumers. 
And it is also the reason that I plan to vote for `Amendment E,' an initiated measure that will appear on the November 3rd, 1998 South Dakota general election ballot. This measure corresponds very closely to a similar measure in Nebraska, which has been deemed constitutional by the United States Supreme Court, and has allowed Nebraska to maintain both market share and number of producers much better than its neighboring states, including South Dakota. I'm not telling any South Dakotan how to vote on this or any other issue, but I do want to add my voice to those who believe the move toward the corporatization of our family farming system has gone too far. We have far too much at stake to simply sit silently by while the best food producing system ever devised by humankind is allowed to die a slow and painful death.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take the opportunity today to honor Robert (Bob) Martin for his years of hard work and commitment to the people of South Dakota. I would also like to extend my warmest wishes and congratulate Bob on his upcoming retirement. 
Bob, a native of Estelline, South Dakota, graduated from high school in 1952. After his graduation Bob joined the United States Navy and proudly served from 1952-1956. Following his military service, he attended Dakota State University in Madison, South Dakota receiving a bachelors degree in 1960. With a degree in hand, Bob became a welcomed addition to the faculty in the Madison School System where I am certain he inspired many students to pursue their dreams. 
In 1965, Bob joined KEM Electric Cooperative, in Linton, North Dakota, serving as Public and Member Relations and Power Use Director. Coming back to his South Dakota roots, Bob returned to Madison in 1970 to become Member Service Director for East River Electric Power Cooperative and eventually Assistant to the General Manager at East River, a position he held until 1983. Ultimately, Bob became Manager of the Member Services and Public Affairs Division and remained in this position until 1990. In 1990, Bob left East River Electric to become General Manager of Rushmore Electric Power Cooperative located in Rapid City, South Dakota. 
Bob's lifetime of service to rural electric cooperatives is impressive and reflects his commitment to public power and the critically important role rural electric cooperatives play in rural America. Bob has been a leader on many different issues important to public power and rural electrics, from preventing the privatization of the Power Marketing Administrations to helping further rural water efforts in South Dakota. Rural electric cooperatives are an important factor in the economic development of their communities and in many cases, they are the best equipped to work to ensure small communities remain viable and continue to keep medical facilities, schools and other services available. I am convinced the importance of rural cooperatives will continue to grow, but it will require the dedication of more individuals like Bob Martin to ensure the future of public power. 
Today, Bob is a member of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology Citizens Advisory Committee; a Director on the Board of the Mid-West Electric Consumers Association; chairs the Rapid City Chamber of Commerce Agriculture Committee; and is Chairman of the Pennington County Extension Board. 
In addition to his military, scholastic, and professional achievements Bob and his wife, Kay have four grown children and five grandchildren. Again, I would like to thank Bob for all he has done to better South Dakota and I would like to wish him best of luck in his retirement. Although I imagine that keeping up with five grandchildren is not exactly retirement.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to recognize Philip and Marge Odeen of Virginia. These two natives of Yankton, South Dakota have been selected by the Northern Virginia Community Foundation to receive the 1998 Northern Virginia Community Founder's Award. The Founder's Award is presented each year to those citizens who have consistently demonstrated a commitment to both civic and humanitarian concerns, while making a substantial contribution to improving the quality of life in Northern Virginia. The Founder's Award is a tribute to the Odeens' leadership in all of these areas. 
From the time they moved east in 1960, the Odeens made an immediate impact in the areas of commerce, public affairs, the arts, and community improvement. Phil distinguished himself in the public sector at the National Security Council, later as a co-founder of the World Affairs Council, and most recently in his work with BDM International and TRW. Marge's endeavors on behalf of Northern Virginia Community College and the Women's Center have also been noted for their success. 
Throughout their professional careers Phil and Marge have always found a way to donate time and effort to worthy causes such as the Salvation Army, Childhelp USA, the Heart Association, and the Wolf Trap Foundation. They have given freely to non-profit organizations in terms of time and money, have consistently taken the lead in getting others involved, and most importantly have positively affected the lives of numerous men, women, and children in the Washington area. 
I would like to commend the Odeens for their numerous contributions to the Northern Virginia Community; their community leadership serves as a model for the citizens of both Virginia and South Dakota to emulate.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a special colleague and a true American hero, John Glenn of Ohio. 
During his distinguished career, Senator Glenn has used his boundless energy and expertise to work for effective and efficient government and world peace. He is one of our most beloved national figures and a role model to people of all ages and all backgrounds from all over the world. 
I was a teenager when the nation watched in awe as John Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth. I never would have guessed during those spectacular early days of the space program that someday I would have an office next to his in the United States Senate. It has been my great privilege to serve with him and to know him as both a friend and a colleague. 
Today, he is at Cape Canaveral preparing to visit space again. I know my colleagues share in my admiration and pride for Senator Glenn as he boldly goes once more into space. I wish him an exciting journey, a safe return and wonderful retirement. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise to express in part my profound disappointment with the contents of the agricultural appropriations conference report, recognizing that there are many in this body--in particular, that there are numerous instances, thanks to the leadership of the Senator from Mississippi, and others--who have brought together a sense of bipartisanship on some key issues. And there are other issues and other needs that I believe this body needs to address outside of this agricultural appropriations bill, as my very good friend and colleague from Kansas has made reference to a string of extraneous other issues that are urgent. 
On the issue of trade, I believe that there is fairly good agreement in this body relative to where we need to go next. There is support in this body for funding for the International Monetary Fund. That is perhaps the single thing we could do that would have the greatest immediate impact on stabilizing currencies and opening markets and stabilizing economies in Asia, and increasingly in Russia and Latin America. Unfortunately, that issue has been held up in the other body, not this one; but it is an issue that should be dealt with before we adjourn for the year. 
My colleague raises the issue of fast track. On that issue I share his concern that we ought to have fast-track authority. This body does as well. The House does not. I think in all fairness, though, it ought to be kept in mind that if we were to pass fast track, that would have a consequence years down the road but not next month, not the next 6 months. It would simply put our trade representative back in at the negotiating table for trade negotiations. That would bear fruit probably years down the road from now, but it would not have an immediate consequence. 
Certainly, in the case of relief of unilateral sanctions and the sanctions reform legislation that our colleague, the chairman of our Senate Ag Committee, Senator Lugar, has championed, we ought to be moving forward with that. Unfortunately, we have not. But I think there is broad-based bipartisan consensus that we ought to do that. And certainly MFN, now having normal trade relations with China as well, is something that we should go forward with. 
I think all these issues are concurred upon by this President and by the majority of both political parties in the Senate. Those are issues we should proceed with. We should not use them, however, as an excuse for a lack of action, for inaction on key disaster issues before us today. 
On the tax agenda, as well, I think that there is broad-based support in both political parties for tax relief targeted to middle-class and working families, certainly for those in the agricultural sectors of our economy. But again in fairness, it ought to be kept in mind that the tax package that arrived in this body from the other body is funded 100 percent out of the Social Security trust fund surplus. That is unacceptable to a great many of us in this body. It is utterly unacceptable to the President of the United States who has expressed his veto intent if that were to reach his desk. I think there is a great likelihood it will reach his desk, but if he were to veto it, he would do the right thing. 
And we talk about statesmanship, that is what we are talking about--doing the right thing, rejecting what seems on the surface to be popular, recognizing that in too many instances the underlying premise that allows that action to go forward is, in fact, simply wrong. Stealing money, raiding, plundering the Social Security trust fund is not acceptable for any of us. Regardless of how great the crisis might be that we have in agricultural today, how much we would like to have tax relief for every sector of our economy, that is not where we need to go. 
To his great credit, Senator Daschle, with the help of numerous others, has put together a tax package which provides most of the same kinds of relief that my friend from Kansas was making reference to, but is funded exclusively out of efficiencies, out of savings, out of the closure of tax loopholes in the existing Tax Code and budget. So it is not a question of whether we can have tax relief or whether we cannot have tax relief; we can so long as it is carefully targeted, so long as it is focused on those areas where it is most in need, and so long as it is truly offset by savings, by efficiencies, by loophole closures--other places--and not premised on a raid on Social Security. 
So, again, I think we ought to be able to find bipartisan agreement before we leave here on those issues as well. 
I want to say that we did reach some concurrence on some important issues in this body. The pain and the hurt that is going on across much of rural America today is too great to allow for the kind of finger pointing and partisanship that too often characterizes the debate in this Congress, especially as we draw near an election as we reach the end of this Congress. 
I am pleased that in this body we were able to find bipartisan agreement on my particular amendment that was incorporated in the Senate version of the agricultural appropriations bill on meat labeling. The Senator from Idaho 
was a champion on the meat labeling issue. And I was pleased that the chairman, the Senator from Mississippi, was supportive of our concern in the conference committee in that regard. 
I am disappointed in what turned out to be a party-line vote from our colleagues in the House of Representatives that thwarted the will of the U.S. Senate in that regard--a measure which has the support of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the National Farmers Union, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and the American Sheep Industry Association. 
The underlying bill, which had the sponsorship of eight Republican Senators and eight Democratic Senators, along with myself--this was a bipartisan effort to, for the first time, allow consumers to know the origin of their food products which they serve their families, much as they do virtually every other consumer item that they purchase. Yet even this commonsense measure was turned down in the conference committee, to my great disappointment. And I want to confirm that this issue simply will not go away. It will be revisited and revisited until it becomes law. 
We also found bipartisan support on the Senate agricultural appropriations bill--again, with the support of the Senator from Idaho, the Senator from Mississippi, and a great many others --in a bipartisan fashion, to allow price transparency in the livestock industry to go forward, to put our individual livestock producers on the same footing as the packing industry to give them a better marketing opportunity. And yet even that which would have seemed, again, to be common sense we lost, unfortunately, on a partisan, party-line vote on the part of the House conferees, over the objections of the Senate. 
I want to express my disappointment at the loss of both of those provisions which would not have meant night or day, would not have turned around overnight the price crisis that we have in the livestock industry, but we would have contributed, I think, in a very constructive fashion to lay the groundwork for a long-term recovery, and it would have been a constructive, positive step in the right direction. We reached some bipartisan agreement, I think, in this body early on, again, on the need for disaster relief. 
I think we all recognized as time went on, as disasters struck the South and the West, other parts of the country, that the amount of money, the $500 million we had placed in the Senate agriculture appropriations bill simply was not going to be adequate from anyone's perspective, and that needed to be augmented in a significant way. I think the President is right that if we are going to realistically address the real pain all across rural America, that a final level of disaster relief approximating the funding in the President's recommendation rather than in the House proposal and imposed on the conference report on ag appropriations is more appropriate. 
I think we all recognize that there needs to be some give-and-take, that the final version of whatever we do probably will not meet the 100 percent satisfaction of any of us here, should not be 100 percent what the Republican leadership in the House was offering, probably will not be completely what the President is offering; but we need to come together somewhere in the middle in a way which more effectively deals with the disaster that is national in scope and deals with it in a meaningful way, all within the context of, obviously, a balanced Federal budget. 
I believe we can do that, but we need to take, I believe, some of the direction that is coming from the White House to moderate the provisions which have been imposed in the ag appropriations bill by our House colleagues. 
This should not turn into a bidding war. It has been suggested that could occur. That would be wrong. That is not where we need to go. But we do need to step back, and with some careful deliberation and some care, evaluate the scope of the relief that needs to be made in order to have a meaningful consequence in the context of this national disaster. 
One area where we were not able to reach bipartisan consensus in this body--and I certainly respect the views of those who differ with me and with many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle--is on the wisdom of utilizing a strategy which would take the cap off the existing marketing loan provisions in the freedom to market legislation. 
Now, it is suggested by some that that is an attack on Freedom to Farm, that this is on the part of those who would go back to the old days of the previous farm bill. I think that simply is untrue. That is a straw man that is easily knocked down but one that does not characterize the goals and the perspective of those of us who believe that it makes a lot of sense to take the caps off the existing marketing loan. Keep in mind, the current bill has marketing loan provisions in it. It is not a turning inside out of that legislation. 
The problem with the existing legislation, the existing farm bill, is that the loan rates established in that farm bill are unrealistically low. They are too low to be meaningful given the kind of crisis that we have today. And taking the caps off that loan rate and tying it to a 5-year Olympic average is a moderate but responsible step in the right direction. In fact, if we were to do that--and we are talking about doing this for 1 year only, so it would have no consequence whatever on planting decisions made by others because the crops have already been planted and are about to be harvested--it would have a 57-cent-per-bushel increase for wheat, 28 cents for corn, 28 cents for beans, if we were to follow the proposal in the President's recommendation. 
That won't make anyone rich, that won't bring the price back to anywhere near where a lot of us think in an ideal world it ought to be, but it will stave off in so many ways the crisis that is upon us. It will give a decent return. It will treat renters more fairly than alternative proposals would. It will not turn the clock back. It will not abandon the existing farm bill. It will be done within the context of that farm bill and we will preserve the marketing flexibility that I think a great many of us value in that farm legislation. 
I think there is room for bipartisan concurrence. This is not a matter of one political party rolling the other or stiffing the other or coming away 100 percent victorious. I think in good faith everybody in this body wants to do what reasonably can be done to create the framework whereby family producers can at least survive the current era and emerge from the other side with an opportunity for prosperity in the future. 
If we do nothing and if we take steps that are simply wholly inadequate, we are going to see the loss of thousands upon thousands of agricultural producers both in the grain and livestock sectors of our economy. The FSA leadership in my State tells us that we could lose as many as a third of the farmers and ranchers in my home State of South Dakota. That is unacceptable. That has consequences not only for the lives of those families, many of whom have been on the land for 100 years or more, going back to homesteading days, but it has consequences up and down the main streets of every community as well--not just the small farm community but the larger communities--as well as the ripple effect that takes hold, affecting the medium and large communities. I think this has global consequences. We need to recognize that as we address the situation. 
I think we ought to avoid the pride of authorship and the temptation to subscribe to partisan warfare and find the middle ground. It makes meaningful, constructive, positive relief a `doable' sort of thing. I am hopeful we can send this conference report back to committee, not to emerge with a radically different approach, but to emerge with something looking more like what the President has recommended, more like what many of us on this side of the aisle would like to see happen. The veto threat is there and people can argue whether it ought to be there or not. I believe that the President is correct. I believe that the President is doing the responsible thing and doing the statesmanlike thing under these dire circumstances. 
In the end, it is going to require both sides coming together. I think that is what our constituents want to see. I think they want to see us during these closing days of this 105th Congress reach that consensus that would allow for some substantially higher level of disaster relief than is currently being posed, utilized in a way that more efficiently gets to the people who need it, which addresses the national nature of the disaster which we face, and which sets a framework for prosperity in future years rather than simply being a Band-Aid for now. 
Again, it is my hope that the issue of labeling country of origin on meat products--a compromise version which the Senator from Idaho and I subscribe to and went to great lengths to propose--could be revisited. Secondly, it is my hope that price transparency in the livestock industry can be revisited before we leave at the end of this week. 
Much remains to be done. There is too much to be done to fall victim to partisanship and to finger pointing. We need a 
greater level of statesmanship, a greater level of cooperation than, frankly, has been the case all these past months. We are dealing with the very lives and the very future of thousands of hard-working, honest people in rural America who want nothing more than an opportunity to survive the year and to live by the sweat of their brow and the hard work of their families in years to come. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998. 
The Higher Education Act has been of enormous benefit to millions of students over the past three decades in providing more affordable access to institutions of post-secondary education. Many of these students simply would not have gone to college or vocational school without the assistance provided through such programs as Pell Grants, student loans, and work study. 
With the increased competition faced by workers in the global economy, the importance of these programs is even greater today, not only for students, but also for our nation's economy. The Higher Education Act programs account for 68 percent of all financial aid available to students. In FY 1999, the student aid programs authorized under the Higher Education Reauthorization Act will provide $50 billion of aid to over 8.8 million students. 
The cost of a college education continues to grow far faster than inflation, leaving more and more students with a large debt once they finish. Last fall, the College Board released a nationwide survey of tuition costs, finding that tuition and fees would rise about 5 percent for the fifth year in a row. 
In contrast, inflation in the overall economy has been held under control during these years, hovering at, or below 2 percent. 
As costs have increased, student borrowing has expanded to make up the difference. Student loans now comprise about 60 percent of all financial aid, whereas in the 1980-81 school year, loans were just over 40 percent of the total. 
Given the increased reliance on borrowing, it is notable that this reauthorization legislation provides for a reduction in interest rates on new student loans from 8.25 percent to 7.46 percent, saving $11 billion for students over the life of their loans. The typical borrower at a 4-year college, who graduates with $13,000 in debt, will save about $700 over a ten-year repayment period. This is a major educational milestone, allowing student borrowers the lowest interest rate in 17 years. 
Nearly 84 percent of South Dakota students receive financial aid in some form, with an average annual award of $5,400 to students who receive aid at the six public universities. Approximately 16,000 students in South Dakota receive Pell Grants, accounting for $28 million in federal assistance. 
I am pleased that this bill gradually increases the size of the maximum Pell Grant to $5,800 in academic years 2003-4. In the 1970s, Pell Grants covered three-quarters of the costs of attending a four-year public school. Today, these grants cover only one-third of the cost. I realize that finding the budget resources to fund this maximum grant fully will be a struggle, however Pell Grants are the most effective program we have for helping low-income students afford post-secondary education. 
This legislation also continues the essential Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program. This program alone has enabled forty million Americans to attend college over the past thirty years. Although direct lending by the federal government has consumed a portion of the overall student loan volume, all of the colleges and universities in my state of South Dakota continue to use the FFEL program and remain satisfied with the services they receive. Accordingly, I have been skeptical of efforts that might destroy the balance that has existed between direct lending and the FFEL program. Federal policy should not be changed in ways to either favor direct lending or undermine the financial viability of lending by the private sector. 
There are some lesser-noticed provisions of this bill of which I am particularly proud. Promoting the availability and affordability of child care has been one of my highest priorities in the Senate. That is why I am so pleased that legislation I cosponsored earlier this year, the CAMPUS Act, has been incorporated into this bill. CAMPUS stands for Child Care Access Means Parents in School. This provision will establish a grant program to assist colleges with the costs of establishing child care centers to provide campus-based child care for low-income parents attending college. 
The obvious benefit of easy access to child care is that students with young children will have a much greater probability of staying in school and completing their degree. More and more students today are non-traditional students, and the need for campus-based child care is greater than ever before. 
Additionally, this bill establishes an innovative new program to offer student loan forgiveness for those who earn a degree in early childhood education and become full-time child care workers in a child care facility. Child care, unfortunately, is one of the lowest-paying professions that one can find, and this low level of pay is completely incommensurate with the value of those who are caring for young children. Not surprisingly, turnover in this field is very high, as workers find better paying jobs elsewhere. 
It is especially tragic when highly-trained graduates, those who have earned a degree in early childhood education, are forced to leave the child care profession because they cannot pay their student loans. We still need to do all we can to raise wages for child care workers, but helping with student loan repayment is a remarkable step forward. This concept was included in child care legislation I cosponsored last year, and I am very pleased that it has been included in this bill. 
I am pleased this bill develops new distance education partnership models through the Learning Anytime Anywhere Partnership (LAAP) program. This creative initiative provides partnerships grants between schools and other entities to assist in the expansion of student achievement in distance education. LAAP, combined with the expansion of student aid for distance learners, will allow more nontraditional students to obtain higher education, including full-time workers, parents, people in rural areas, or individuals with disabilities. 
In addition to meeting the needs of rural America through distance learning, the Higher Education Act speaks to an equally important population of students: Indian Country. This bill includes a new initiative to provide grants and related assistance to Indian Tribal Colleges and Universities to improve and expand their capacity to serve Indian students. The bill authorizes $10 million for FY 1999 and such sums as may be necessary in the years beyond FY 1999. This new initiative for Tribal Colleges will provide much-needed funding to strengthen academic programs, develop faculty, and improve student services. 
Finally, I support the extension of the Special Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program (LEAP), formerly known as the State Student Incentive Grant (SSIG) program. SSIG provides funding on a dollar-for-dollar match to help states provide need-based financial aid to students through grants and community service work study awards. Without this federal incentive, many states would not have established state financial aid programs. As a cosponsor of the LEAP Act, I am pleased that states will now gain new flexibility to use these funds for activities such as increasing grant amounts, carrying out academic or merit scholarships programs, community service programs, and early interventions programs. This program is yet another example of a federal-state partnership developed to create maximum opportunities for students seeking higher education. 
While I am pleased with the inclusion of numerous programs that will benefit students pursing higher education, I am deeply disappointed the conference report failed to include an important amendment to count higher education as a work requirement for purposes of the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program. I was a proud cosponsor of this amendment which enjoyed a bipartisan majority in the Senate-passed bill. 
Throughout this Congress, the leadership has echoed the importance of taking personal responsibility and achieving independence. As a supporter of welfare reform, I support imposing work requirements on individuals who receive cash assistance. However, to not allow students to earn a degree, a certifiable ticket to self-sufficiency, is irresponsible and thoughtless. 
I have heard from a number of my constituents that the current system has had the unfortunate effect of forcing TANF recipients out of college or vocational school and into dead-end, entry-level jobs. It seems obvious that enabling these individuals, which are usually single mothers, to complete a degree would be far more effective in achieving long-term benefits. Education leads to higher income levels, helping move these families out of poverty for good and making them productive taxpayers. Federal requirements should not be so rigid and inflexible that states are prevented from exercising this option. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in addressing this need in the Higher Education Act of 1998, however, I am committed to working with Senator Wellstone and other advocates to revisit this issue in the future. 
Passage of the Higher Education Reauthorization Act of 1998 was absolutely essential for the continuation and improvement of a system that helps keep post-secondary education within the reach of typical American families. I was pleased with the expeditious manner by which Congress responded to the conference report and President Clinton's prompt signing of the bill.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I have a question for the Senator. 
One is, there has been a great deal said by the Senator from North Dakota about changing the farm bill and reopening the farm bill relative to taking the caps off the marketing loan rates. It is my understanding that the existing farm bill has marketing loan provisions in it; that the real discussion and the recommendation from the President has simply been that we raise the caps of an existing program within the existing farm bill; that, in fact, the initiative would not involve any significant change in the farm bill, certainly no more so than accelerating or increasing half the payments. Will the Senator share a view on that?

Mr. JOHNSON. If I may follow up on that, the Senator from North Dakota has been one of this body's leaders relative to budget responsibility, fiscal responsibility, and the overall effort that we have gone about in bringing the annual Federal budget deficit from $292 billion only 6 years ago to at least a unified budget surplus this year. I think the Senator from North Dakota was deeply involved in the crafting of the legislation that set up the framework that allowed us to bring this country to the current point of much greater fiscal responsibility. 
But it is my understanding, in the context of that debate and setting up the pay-as-you-go budget mechanisms that were established in the early 1990s, which have been so successful, that one of the underlying premises and understanding of that legislation was that there would be from time to time emergency needs that would be met with the request from the President with the concurrence of the Congress, and that it is not inconsistent with the underlying legislation and the progress that we have made towards reducing the deficit. So long as we use care to denominate emergencies as only things which are truly emergencies and are reasonably not foreseeable by either the White House or by the Congress, the funding of these emergency needs is not inconsistent with the effort we have made to reduce the deficit and to maintain the discipline of the 1990 and 1993 budget agreements. 
Is that the Senator's recollection relative to the context of this emergency budget request?

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to again express publicly my profound dismay and disappointment in President Clinton's personal behavior relative to the Monica Lewinsky affair. I cannot state in terms too strong the disapproval I feel. There can be no meaningful line of distinction between wrongful and immoral personal conduct on the part of the President and the expectations the American public rightfully has over his role as a public official. The President's conduct was wrong. The response of Congress must be deliberate and carefully consistent with the requirements of law and the Constitution, but at the very least, President Clinton owes the American citizenry an apology and good faith cooperation in bringing this sorry episode to an expeditious conclusion.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, we have reached an extraordinary point in our Nation's contemporary history with the finding of the Office of Management and Budget that we will, in fact, at the end of this fiscal year, be running a significant budget surplus. 
I think there are a great number of causes for that, a great number of people who could be commended for that, but I think to put this in some perspective, it is worthwhile to note that some 6 years ago when President Clinton took office, the annual deficit each year by the U.S. Government was running in the range of $292 billion each year. We were spending $292 billion more revenue than we had coming in. The size of the Federal deficit had exploded through the 1980s, and we had reached, finally, this terrible point in 1992. 
Since that time, we have had 6 years of successive declines in the Federal budget deficit until, finally, this year for the first time in 30 years we are now at least in a unified budget in surplus. 
What an extraordinary accomplishment. At a time when other nations' economies are suffering, this country has reduced its debt relative to its gross domestic product to a lower level than any other industrialized nation on Earth. Again there are a great many people who can take some credit for this. But I think that the leadership of this White House has been a key part of it. 
Now, the Senator who preceded me had a chart showing one of President Clinton's plans. It did not show the plan that actually was acted upon which has led to this decline in the deficit. It did show the alternative competing Republican plan that was offered in 1992 which, as many of us recall, was premised on plundering the Medicare fund, education, and the environment. One of the constructive steps that this President took was to lead the way, ultimately with a budget plan which brought us to a balanced budget--in fact, to a surplus--and showed, in fact, we did not need to plunder education, Medicare, and health care in order to get to this point. 
So we have had 6 years of declining deficits. That is the good news. However, there is a point of great concern that I have as a member of the Senate Budget Committee. That is, we reached this point because there was an agreement between Congress and the President that we would put our country on a pay-as-you-go basis. That is, no tax cuts unless it is simultaneously explained who is going to pay more taxes or whose programs will be cut to pay for those tax cuts, and no spending increases unless it is simultaneously explained who is going to pay more taxes or have their programs cut to pay for those increases. Every step had to be budget neutral, scored over a 5-year period by the Office of Management and Budget and by the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO. 
After years of wandering in the wilderness of faulty and unsuccessful mechanisms that go back over a decade, we finally reached a formula that put this country on a commonsense, pay-as-you-go basis, something we should have been doing for 200 years but which we have been doing now for about 6 years. 
Because we now have this unified budget surplus, we find there are those in Congress who grow giddy about this projected surplus. By some projections it could run as high as $1.6 trillion over the next decade. Keep in mind that those projections are not money in hand, they are simply projections, and they are premised on the notion that our country will continue to have economic growth in the range of 2.2 GDP growth annually from here to the horizon, 
and that we will never stumble into a recession and that our economy will never slow down again. 
Well, while we have had a remarkable run of good fortune over the years of the Clinton Presidency, with record low unemployment, low inflation and high economic growth, I think it would be foolhardy for any of us to assume that somehow business cycles have been abolished, that we are on an upward plain and that economic growth will never end. So I think we need to approach these projections with a great deal of caution and some skepticism, given what is going on today with the economies in Asia, Russia, and increasingly in Latin America. 
Secondly, the other point of caution that I think needs to be stated with great emphasis is that the budget surplus that we have today, as noteworthy as it is, and as worthy of applause as it is, is a unified budget surplus; that is, our operating budget is still in the deficit. That is, the surplus that we have is only a surplus if you count revenue flowing into the Social Security trust fund. I think the chart that I have with me here graphically shows the circumstances we face today. 
The Federal surpluses--and it is simply amazing that we are even talking about surpluses, given where we have been over the last decade--the Federal surpluses are projected to grow steadily all the way out through the year 2008, and that is the farthest out anyone has dared make a projection. That is a positive thing. 
Before we get carried away about how to spend the surplus, whether for tax cuts or for new programs, the red line represents where we are without counting Social Security money. If you look at that, we will not be in the black until the year 2002. That is even assuming continued economic growth. We are not in the black--we have nobody's money to spend other than the Social Security revenue until the year 2002. We will dip back into deficit, in fact, briefly, under current projections, in 2003. It is approximately 2005 before we will be consistently in the black, without counting Social Security surplus dollars and the interest earnings that are attributable to Social Security. Finally, in about 2005, if we behave ourselves and continue to go on pay-as-you-go, if the economy continues to grow, we will be in the black, without counting the money that needs to be reserved for Social Security. 
So the President was exactly right as he talked to both the House and the Senate this year, saying, `do not be thinking about how to spend this surplus this year when we have not yet decided what we are going to do about our long-term reform for Social Security.' That issue will be up next year in the 106th Congress. It is not for certain it will be resolved in 1 year, either. We have some reforms that no doubt will have to be made for the long-term viability of Social Security. If we do nothing, the Social Security trust fund will eventually be drawn down and today's baby boomers will receive only about 75 percent of today's buying value of Social Security. It is not as if Social Security will go away. It is not as though the system will collapse, but as you get far out into the 2032 range, today's boomers and today's younger people, who are also relying on Social Security, will find that the buying power of that program has been reduced by about one-fourth. So there is a need to make changes, and the sooner they are made to preserve the full 100-percent buying power of Social Security for those outyears, the better off we are. But in the meantime, to use money that has been raised and collected from the American 
taxpayers for the purposes of a strong Social Security system, and to use it for another purpose, is simply wrong. 
If we approach this with the kind of responsibility that I think is needed, and with the kind of bipartisanship I believe is needed, we will reject the tax proposal coming to this body from the House of Representatives, which calls for a tax cut paid for out of Social Security revenue. 
Now, the Senator who preceded me was making reference to a $6.6 billion tax cut. That is only the cost to the Treasury next year. It is an $80 billion tax cut over 5 years, $170 billion over 10, and it goes into perpetuity, forever, constantly taking more and more money out of the Social Security surplus fund--all the more reason to nip that in the bud, stop now and take a deep breath, albeit an election year and there is a temptation on the part of our friends in the other body to offer what looks like a free giveaway. 
There is a need in this body, I think, to respond responsibly to that kind of proposal coming to us from the House. There may be room for some tax relief this year. I applaud the leadership of Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader, and others who have worked with him, including those from the White House, in suggesting that we could find in the range of a $25 billion tax relief package, which could be focused on the needs of the middle class and working families, and it could be done through savings in the existing budget, through new efficiencies in the existing budget, from the closure of loopholes in the existing Tax Code. That could free up in the range of $25 billion to be utilized for tax relief for middle class and working families. So it is not a question of are you for tax relief or not; I think there is room for some tax relief. But it has to be financed out of the existing budget, rather than going the easy route and that is raiding the Social Security trust fund. 
I think something needs to be said as well about the requests for emergency funds. Much has been said about the requests from the President for emergency funding. I think there is a possibility that some of those requests could be offset from within the existing budget, but I think it also needs to be clear that the needs being presented to the Congress by the White House were not foreseen either by the White House or by the Congress in either political party. It was not foreseen that we would have expenses at the scope that they are for dealing now with the year 2000 computer problem, and the delay of addressing that problem will only cost the taxpayers and the economy potentially enormous sums later down the road. Congress did not foresee, nor did the White House, when the original budget was presented last year, the full cost of our Bosnia role, or the need to upgrade security at our embassies, or the scope of the farm crisis today. 
Again, it is my hope that perhaps some of this could be offset by reductions elsewhere in the budget. But the fact is that the budget agreement that was agreed to, which led us on the track toward the reduction of that $292 billion deficit to a surplus today, was premised on the assumption that we would, from time to time, have emergency needs that would have to be funded outside of the budget. There is no surprise to that. I think we need to use discipline so we don't wind up denominating everything that comes along that we would like to do as an emergency. But it is in the nature of emergency funding, and it is one time only that it could not be reasonably foreseen, as these were not either by the White House or by the Congress, and that they have some extraordinary level of urgency about them. 
The budget agreement that led to this elimination of the budget deficit did foresee that we would have these emergencies come up from time to time. So nobody should be surprised today that we do, in fact, have a need to address some issues that may have to be outside the pay-as-you-go framework that has, overall, led us to the budget deficit. But what we cannot afford to do is to use Social Security surpluses as a source of funding for nonemergency, in perpetuity-type expenditures, whether it be domestic spending programs or for tax relief that could not otherwise be funded. I, for one, think that the next priority, after preserving Social Security, probably ought to be to begin to pay down the existing accumulated debt that this country has in the $5 trillion range, or more. 
To the extent that we do that, we are, in fact, hoping that every taxpayer in this country--to the extent that the U.S. Government is not competing for credit dollars and that we bring down interest rates--buying a car, buying a home, sending a kid to college, or expanding a business and creating jobs, is made easier and all the more affordable for the private sector of our economy to do. 
If we act with budget responsibility here, keep our Federal budget in equilibrium with the pay-as-you-go mechanism that was passed initially in the 1993 budget agreement--legislation which has passed and has contributed more than any other single legislative policy step taken in Congress, passed without a vote of a single Republican Member, passed exclusively with Democratic votes in both the House and the Senate. And there were many Members of Congress, many Democrats, frankly, who lost their seats in Congress, in the House and the Senate, over the controversy, over the contention, that the passage of that landmark legislation caused because it was a bold step. It was a courageous step. It reduced our Federal budget deficit from $292 billion to a surplus today. But as is often said in politics, no good deed goes unpunished. And that was certainly the case of many of our colleagues who are no longer here; who did the right thing and paid a dear price for it. But here we are with positive consequences of that legislation which has led us now to a surplus with a unified budget. The great danger we have is to abandon the discipline which that budget legislation set in place. 
I am hopeful as we finish up these closing weeks that we will reject this shortsighted and I believe somewhat demagogic, frankly, effort coming out of the other body to raid the Social Security trust fund. 
I hear people saying, `Well, the President wants to address emergency crises. So we ought to just pile on and spend more money out of the Social Security trust fund.' That is the logic that is not worthy of a third grader, in my view. We have some emergency crises of one time only that we will face, and we will decide how to finance that, whether it is out of the ordinary budget, or whether it is through an offset, or some combination of both. But to set us on track down the road in perpetuity for nonemergency, long-term expenditures out of the Social Security trust fund makes no sense whatever. 
Of the $1.6 trillion surplus projected over the next decade, virtually the entire sum is attributable to Social Security and the interest earnings due to Social Security. 
So let's resolve one problem at a time: Maintain the discipline that has made this much progress over the last half dozen years of the Clinton administration; preserve Social Security so we can make some difficult policy choices in the coming years about what we need to do further to maintain its viability on into the next generation. When we have done that, then we may be in a position ultimately, if we have surpluses at that point, to decide what combination of investments in our schools, in child care, in health care, in medical research and, yes, possibly in tax relief for American taxpayers might be able to come out of that surplus. But don't get put the cart before the horse. Do not be demagogic in an election year about this kind of issue. We need some statesmanship. We need some bipartisan responsibility as we deal with what I believe is one of the most fundamental most challenging responsibilities that our Congress has; that is, how do we sustain our economic growth? How do we sustain the pay-as-you-go discipline that has brought us to this good point after so many years--after 30 years--of budget deficits? 
Mr. President, I conclude by saying that it is certainly my hope that statesmanship will rise to the top; that we will abide with the President's recommendation; that we not raid the Social Security trust fund during these closing days of this Congress; that we go home and tell our constituents that we did the right thing; we did the right thing by them; we did the right thing by our government; we did the right thing by our Nation by retaining fiscal responsibility; and by preserving the opportunity to have a strong Social Security program on into the future years, at least until we decide what future changes are needed. By doing that we will keep the cost of money down for the private sector, and we will do as much as possibly can be done to put us on track to sustain what has been record economic growth, low inflation, low unemployment, and increased opportunity for all of our citizens. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to reiterate my support for S. 1645, the Child Custody Protection Act. I have long supported the right of states to enact and enforce parental notification laws with respect to a minor's access to abortion services, and I believe steps should be taken to prevent individuals from circumventing such laws. However, I voted against cloture on this bill today because such a vote would have had the effect of denying my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle an opportunity to offer amendments. While I do not necessarily support all of the amendments which might have been offered, I cannot in good conscience vote to circumvent what should be an open and fair debate on this important issue. The White House has threatened to veto this bill in its current form and I believe a vote for cloture today would have sealed the fate of this bill without consideration of compromise language toward the shared goal of preventing abortions. 
Every parent has the right to be involved in their minor's decision to terminate a pregnancy. The Child Custody Protection Act would promote parental participation in what must be the most difficult decision a young girl might face. The federal government can play a roll in protecting states rights in this regard, and should support minor and adult women in alternatives to abortion. I always have supported efforts to promote adoption to ensure that children grow up in a loving environment with a supportive family. I believe the federal government should promote adoption assistance and should encourage moving children from foster care into adoptive homes. I remain hopeful that my colleagues in both political parties and I can work together to create a system that reduces unwanted pregnancies and abortions, encourages adoption, and results in strong families. 
Mr. President, I will continue to work with the Senate leadership in an effort to move the Child Custody Protection Act forward so that the rights of parents are protected in the face of this most difficult decision, and that minor and adult women continue to be provided with alternatives to terminating a pregnancy.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to give my full support for the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act. This important legislation authorizes and allows for continued funding for important child nutrition programs for the next 5 years, until the year 2003. 
I want to commend Agriculture Committee Chairman Lugar and our ranking member, Senator Harkin, and my colleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee for working cooperatively in what I believe is a very excellent bipartisan spirit to unanimously pass this bill out of committee. I also want to thank my Senate colleagues for passing this vital legislation unanimously on the floor this past week. Clearly, this legislation demonstrates our commitment to feeding our Nation's children in an effective and cost-efficient manner. 
The Child Nutrition Reauthorization legislation provides funding for the National School Lunch and Breakfast Program, for the Child and Adult Care Food Program, the Summer Food Service Program, the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Program, along with many other nutrition food programs to feed our Nation's young people. 
One of the provisions in this legislation that I worked on with a particularly focused effort during this debate was a provision that provides for a detailed research and pilot project on how school breakfast programs impact a child's academic success and behavioral attitudes. 
This research provision is a modified version of S. 1396, the Meals for Achievement Act, which I introduced this last November. The research provision provides for the mandatory funding for a school breakfast research project to further test the impacts of school breakfast on children's academic and behavioral patterns. 
This provision will require the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a 5-year school breakfast study in six different school districts throughout the United States, involving approximately 15,000 schoolchildren. 
As I have stated before, the research on the impact of children eating school breakfast, so far, points overwhelmingly to a positive result. Not only do our research studies so far indicate that the academic scores in reading, writing, and math improve, but levels of hyperactivity and tardiness are greatly reduced. 
The purpose of the study contained in this legislation is to further analyze the existing data and to provide the additional research and data at a national level and to provide the positive impacts--to show what the positive impacts are, in general, of eating a school breakfast. 
It is important to note that the funding for the research provision will require no new additional expenses and maintains our balanced budget discipline. It is not my intention that this research project create any new Federal bureaucracy. However, once the researchers have completed a 5-year study and find, as I believe they will, that breakfast does indeed improve a child's academic success, we as Federal lawmakers can work with local and State officials to create guidelines of how school breakfasts can improve success in all of the schools throughout our Nation. 
The rationale for this provision is very simple: In order for the United States to compete effectively in the world, we must have an educated and productive workforce. We have far too many children who are simply not prepared at the beginning of each schoolday to succeed with their schoolwork. 
In 1994, the Minnesota Legislature directed the Minnesota Department of Children, Families and Learning to implement a universal breakfast pilot program integrating breakfast into the education schedule for all students. The evaluation of the pilot project, performed by the Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement at the University of Minnesota, showed that when all students are involved in school breakfast, there is a general increase in learning and achievement. 
Again, researchers at Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital recently completed a study on the results of a universal free breakfast at one public school in Philadelphia and two in Baltimore. The study, published this week in the Archives of Adolescent and Pediatric Medicine, which is a journal of the American Medical Association, found that students who ate breakfast showed great improvement in math grades, in particular, but also in attendance and punctuality. The researchers also observed that students displayed fewer signs of depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, and other behavioral problems.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, The Economist notes that: 
The researchers found that kids who started eating significantly more breakfast . . . were doing better at school, particularly in mathematics. This result confirms earlier studies on the benefits of breakfasting on academic performance. But Dr. Murphy and his colleagues also found that those children who started eating more breakfast were significantly less likely to feel anxious or depressed, or to be described by their teachers as hyperactive or disruptive . . . less likely to play truant or be late for school. . . . Breakfast is no panacea, but it may be a cost-effective way to help children who most need help. 
And so the provision of the Johnson school breakfast amendment, in our overall nutrition authorization, will build on already-existing research in individual school districts around the country and create a more comprehensive research strategy. But I believe that the facts that will be found are already apparent to us in the smaller research studies that have already been conducted. 
It is my hope that we will be able to build further on this information and this broader research from this larger pilot program contained in this legislation, to what ultimately will be a universal free breakfast program for all schoolchildren throughout the Nation. I think the research already is very apparent that this could be a very cost-effective, efficient way of enhancing academic performance and minimizing behavioral difficulties throughout all the schools in the United States. Obviously, this program would be constructed, as I envisioned, on a voluntary basis, from school district to school district, so there is no federalization or mandate. Yet, there is an opportunity for a constructive partnership to exist between the Federal Government and its nutrition programs and our individual school districts.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to touch on the status of agricultural disaster legislation this morning, which is pending in both the Senate and in the other body. 
As many know, for the last several months the northern plains--in particular including my home State of South Dakota--have suffered through an extraordinarily difficult time in the agricultural sector. We face extremely low prices in both the grain and the livestock side of agriculture. Many parts of the northern plains as well have suffered from grain disease, as well as flooding and other natural calamities that have further caused extreme stress on agricultural producers in general. Now we find prices at remarkably low levels. 
I received a report just recently from Winner, SD, indicating that corn there was bringing only $1.10 a bushel, and wheat in Alpena, SD, was bringing in around $2. Cattle in our State, as they are throughout much of the country, are bringing in the mid-$50 range. This represents a loss for each animal raised by our producers, and it creates a situation where hedging those losses with profitability in the grain sector is not possible either. It is a double-barreled hit. It is one that is unique--one that is not common. Even though we all understand that there are cycles of price in both the grain and livestock sector, for them to both be at the calamitously low level, complicated by further natural disasters at the same time, is just simply wreaking havoc across much of rural America and the United States. 
My farm State colleagues and I have twice brought up our legislative response. We have, frankly, had mixed success on the floor of this body and in Congress in general. The economic relief package that we earlier offered would have provided a lift in the caps on marketing loan rates and an extension of terms of those loans from 9 to 15 months, a strategy that I believe is the most effective strategy that has been debated on this floor relative to addressing the problem of grain prices. 
There is much that we can do in terms of disaster relief, and much of that is fine and good. But I think anyone who doesn't understand that the crisis we face both in livestock and grain is reflective of price simply doesn't get it. While disaster relief will tide some people over and address the cash flow problems that they face now over a short term, this body needs to be addressing the long-term problem of price in grain and livestock. And anything that doesn't do that is simply buying us time for yet another calamity to come down the road sometime soon. 
A second provision in our package that provided disaster indemnity to assist producers who suffered from multiyear disasters--natural and otherwise--is a provision to provide market transparency through mandatory price reporting of livestock sales and mandatory labeling of beef and lamb products for their country of origin. We were successful in incorporating several of these provisions into the agricultural appropriations bill when it was considered on the floor of the Senate. The one measure that we were not successful with, unfortunately, was the lifting of caps and the extension of the marketing loan rates on grain. We have twice now voted on that marketing loan provision, and twice we have been defeated. 
The Senate passed a $500 million indemnity program which, as is now agreed on by everyone essentially, is inadequate given the scope of the losses that have taken place, not just on the northern plains but in Texas, Louisiana, and other parts of the country that have suffered from the dire drought circumstance. 
This legislation now is tied up in conference committee. 
It is my hope that we will see sufficient bipartisanship and statesmanship on the part of the conferees that a final product will return to the House and Senate that will, in fact, be constructive. In the meantime, however, released this weekend and announced this morning is an initiative promoted by the administration that I think this body and the conferees need to look at with the greatest care. 
I applaud my colleague, Senator Daschle, in particular, for his unstinting work on the agriculture crisis problem and for his work with the administration to promote yet another constructive, positive approach to the kind of prices we face. Senator Daschle, who could well have been in our home State campaigning in his own reelection campaign, chose instead to remain here working around the clock and through the weekend with the administration, with our colleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee, with both political parties, trying to see what we could do to augment the relief that had earlier been discussed and which had partially been passed by the Senate. 
I again applaud Senator Daschle's extraordinary leadership, his willingness to stick with the real business of getting this legislation into shape, for getting it to the floor of the Senate, and for working with the administration to make sure that it has both congressional and administration support. 
This relief package would come to slightly over $7 billion for 1 year. It would involve, again, uncapping of the marketing loan rate, which I have discussed and which I think we need to revisit, as the single best strategy available to us to address the issue of inadequate prices in the grain sector. It would lift these caps and extend the loan terms from 9 to 15 months. I think it would have an enormously positive economic impact all across rural America. 
Second, it would tie our relief to production agriculture, which I think is important. 
There is an alternative disaster package being talked about currently that would amount to augmenting the transition payments for producers--actually not the producers so much as it would be for landowners. 
I applaud all efforts to go forward. I am not going to make the perfect the enemy of the good. I think there is urgency here that is critical. We need to proceed in an expeditious fashion as much as possible. I understand it may involve some give and take and will involve some of each side's strategy. But when I look at what the uncapping of the loan rates would do, even at this modest level, it is clear to me that it is a superior alternative. 
The wheat price, which is currently capped at $2.58 per bushel under the Democratic plan, goes to $3.22. That is up 64 cents per bushel. That is under the Democratic plan and the plan proposed by the Clinton administration. 
The alternative to that through the AMTA payments, if you were to equate it on a per bushel basis, would be not a 64-cent increase but a 23-cent increase. 
On corn, the current cap is at $1.89. The Democratic proposal would increase that to $2.25, up 36 cents. The alternative through the AMTA payment increase would equate to about a 10-cent increase rather than a 36-cent increase. 
The soybean cap would be increased modestly--from $5.26 per bushel to $5.33 a bushel, up 7 cents. But under the alternative AMTA approach, soybean producers would stand a chance of getting nothing if their soybeans were not planted on former base acreages. 
The AMTA augmentation also suffers from the problem of what to do about renters. Some 43 percent of the crops being grown in America are being grown by farmers on rented land. It has been our experience in the past that if we do the AMTA payment approach, there may be a great many instances where the money will go exclusively to the landowner but nothing to the farmer who actually is growing the crop. 
The Freedom to Farm legislation touted in the 1996 farm bill delivered planting and management flexibility to farmers. They have been able to take care of that flexibility. I think that has been positive. It has been a positive step in the right direction. I applaud that. No one is suggesting that we back up and retreat from that level of flexibility, that we back into some sort of micromanaged world out of Washington. 
But the fact is when Freedom to Farm passed, wheat prices were nearly $6; not gaining--around $2 in many parts of the country. Corn was in the $3 range. It is far less than that; it is in the $1 range now. 
Circumstances have changed. Many of us would say, `I told you so.' There is a certain amount of foreseeability that those prices were not going to stay at that high level in perpetuity. Now we find that with Freedom to Farm, although it contains some positive things, it is, frankly, grossly inadequate in terms of providing the safety net, providing some kind of stability for family producers. 
Now we find that declining transition payments and then ultimately a pat on the back and a `good luck,' reducing America's commitment to family agriculture from $26 billion at a high water mark over a decade ago to $5 billion and ultimately to nothing, while our European allies spend $50 billion to sustain agriculture there, because they know what it is like to be hungry, puts U.S. producers at an incredible disadvantage. 
It is my hope, again, that we will find the bipartisan will to deal with this in an urgent manner in the coming week or two of this Congress. The administration and the Democratic proposal, on top of these past efforts at meat labeling, price transparency, disaster payments and raising the marketing loan cap--which, by the way, is a marketing loan and not the kind of loan that results in massive grain buildup in supplies and inventory we suffered under in previous years--this disaster package also includes significant funds for Farm Service Administration operating loans for producers who have been hit by a disaster, for land compensation for flooded lands, for payment for crop losses on uninsured crops and for the additional FSA county staff support that will be necessary to implement all of this in an effective and efficient manner. 
The bottom line, in my view, is price. We need to address both, however--the long-term strategy of what to do about price, as well as the short-term cash flow crisis that we have in rural America. 
I believe that the previous package which was adopted only in part took us a long ways in the right direction. The current package, which was announced this morning by the administration, by Senator Daschle and Senator Harkin, I think moves us far beyond the debate that has taken place so far. It is far more constructive. It is far more helpful as we deal with this crisis in rural America. 
I again applaud Senator Daschle's extraordinary leadership, the work of Senator Harkin and other members of the Ag Committee, Secretary Glickman and the Clinton administration for focusing with this kind of intensity in a timely manner on what needs to be done relative to American agriculture this year; not next year, not 5 years down the road, but this year. 
I am hopeful, again, that the conferees will evaluate this proposal with the greatest amount of care and earnestness, and that when we adjourn this coming October, we will, in fact, have addressed this issue in a bipartisan fashion and in a cost-efficient fashion in this body and that it will be on the President's desk and that the President will have an opportunity to sign ag disaster legislation which, in fact, is meaningful and timely and sufficient to get our family producers down the road into another productive year in the coming planting season. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. Johnson. Mr. President, I rise today to give my full support for the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act. This important legislation funds important child nutrition programs for the next five years until the year 2003. 
I want to commend Agriculture Committee Chairman Lugar and Ranking Member Harkin and my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee for working cooperatively, in a bipartisan spirit, to unanimously pass this bill out of Committee. Also, I want to thank my Senate colleagues for passing this vital legislation unanimously last evening. Clearly, this demonstrates our commitment to feeding our nation's children. 
The Child Nutrition Reauthorization bill provides funding for the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, the Summer Food Service Program, the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) program along with many other nutritious food programs to feed our nation's youth. 
One of the provisions in this legislation that I worked closely on during the creation of this legislation was a $20 million provision that provides for detailed research on how school breakfast impacts a child's academic success. 
This research provision is a modified version of S. 1396, the Meals for Achievement Act that I introduced last November. The research provision provides for the mandatory funding for a $20 million school breakfast research project to further test the impacts of school breakfast on children's academic and behavioral skills. 
This provision will require the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a five year school breakfast study in six different school districts throughout the United States--involving approximately 15,000 school children. 
As I've stated before, the research on the impacts of children eating school breakfast speaks for itself. Not only do academic scores in reading, writing, and math improve, levels of hyperactivity and tardiness are greatly reduced. 
The purpose of this study is to further analyze the existing data and to provide additional research and data at the national level and to prove the positive impacts of eating a school breakfast. It is important to note that the funding for the research provision will require no new additional expenses and maintains our balanced budget discipline. It is not my intention with this research project to create a whole new federal bureaucracy that only deals with the implementation of school breakfast program. Furthermore, after the researchers have completed the five-year study and find school breakfast does indeed improve a child's academic success, we, as federal lawmakers, can work with local and state school authorities to create guidelines of how school breakfasts can improve a child's academic success. 
The rationale for this provision of the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act is very simple. In order for the United States to compete effectively in the world, we must have an educated and productive workforce. In order to have an educated and productive workforce, we must prepare our children to learn. In order to prepare our children to learn they must be well nourished, and that begins with a good healthy breakfast. 
The best teachers in the world, with the best standards, cannot teach a hungry child. A child who begins his or her school day with their stomach growling because they either did not have time to eat breakfast or there was no breakfast to be served, is simply too distracted to focus on the lessons being provided by the teacher. 
In 1994, the Minnesota legislature directed the Minnesota Department of Children, Families and Learning to implement a universal breakfast pilot program integrating breakfast into the education schedule for all students. The evaluation of the pilot project, performed by the Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement at the University of Minnesota, showed that when all students are involved in school breakfast, there is a general increase in learning and achievement. 
Researchers at Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital recently completed a study on the results of universal free breakfast at one public school in Philadelphia and two in Baltimore. The study, published this week in the Archives of Adolescent and Pediatric Medicine which is a journal of the American Medical Association, found that students who ate the breakfast showed great improvement in math grades, attendance, and punctuality. The researchers also observed that students displayed fewer signs of depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, and other behavioral problems. 
If we are serious about improving our education system in America, we must first prepare our children to learn. The time has come, therefore, to build upon the pilot program in Minnesota, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and other cities, and integrate school breakfast into the education day, at least at the elementary school level. 
I believe that ensuring a nutritious breakfast for our school kids will help close this `opportunity deficit.' As America enters the 21st century, we cannot afford to allow a single child to be left behind. As Robert Kennedy once wrote, `We need the best of many--not of just a few. We must strive for excellence.' Clearly, the Meals for Achievement provision in the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act is a step in that direction.

Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I commend my colleagues, Senator Daschle, Senator Harkin, Senator Dorgan, Senator Conrad, Senator Wellstone, and others who have devoted a great amount of time, energy, and talent to crafting this amendment. I rise in strong support of this comprehensive farm relief package being debated on the Senate floor today. 
Madam President, I have been in communication with my home State just this morning. Local cash prices for corn now, as we are approaching harvest, have collapsed to a new record low. Cash corn in Winner, SD, is bringing $1.10 per bushel today as we speak. Wheat prices have collapsed to $1.70 per bushel. Land values across my State are beginning to falter. In a communication with a farmer near the Aberdeen, SD, area today, I am apprised of land values that have been valued at $800 an acre bringing only $400 an acre in actual sale this week. 
This has a rippling effect. As I talk to farm implement dealers, those providing feed, chemical dealers, veterinarians, mechanics, and all the people who prosper when farmers and ranchers in our Nation prosper, they say we need now, more than ever, not only comprehensive legislation, but urgent legislation, to deal in a constructive fashion with the crisis we face in farm country. 
Now, Senator Conrad, I think, made an excellent point in pointing out how the European Community is spending roughly $50 billion per year sustaining family agriculture in the E.C. In the United States, where only 10 or 12 years ago we were spending $26 billion ourselves, we are now down to $5 billion, and we are headed to zero, to the point where we sustain family agriculture, in the greatest food-producing mechanism the world has ever known, with far less than one-half percent of the Federal budget. 
Is there a reason our European friends sustain their family agriculture at such a high level? Well, yes, there is. The reason is obvious. In Europe, they have been hungry a couple of times in this century. They know the dilemma that every society faces when agriculture is on its knees, when people are leaving the farm, when food production is inadequate. They value highly the reliability and sustainability and high quality of agriculture in their part of the world. 
We in the United States, I am afraid, have grown complacent with the thought that somehow, no matter what we do, fields will be planted and the livestock will be raised, the food will remain inexpensive at the grocery mart, even while we destroy the roots of our agricultural production in this country. I fear that we are going to reach the point some day when we are going to have an experience something similar to what the former Soviet Union found when they destroyed family agriculture, thinking that they could find a new, more efficient way of growing food, only to find the results catastrophic for their society. 
Now Russia is trying to reestablish family agriculture. But guess what? Once family agriculture has been pulled up by the roots, it is not so easily reestablished. It is very difficult to do. I fear that indirectly we are going down some of that same road of the destruction of family-based agriculture in this country. 
I appreciate that there are some who have such a commitment to the current farm bill that it borders on a theological commitment that nothing could be changed in that farm bill. There is much in the Freedom to Farm legislation that is constructive. And it is positive. I think most of us applaud the flexibility and the lessened degree of micromanagement that came with that farm bill. Yet, at the same time, I think there is a growing recognition that all is not well. In fact, portions of the farm bill need a desperate and urgent revisit. 
We understand that with the collapse of prices that we have now that we need to give farmers a better opportunity to weather these down cycles, both in the grain side, in the farm bill's case, and in terms of livestock production. 
For the past few months, I have joined my farm State Democratic colleagues in working on ways to improve economic conditions for farmers and ranchers. As you may remember, during this year's Agriculture appropriations bill, we introduced legislation to assist farmers. We offered amendments which would lift the caps on marketing loans for grain farmers, provide disaster assistance for farmers who suffered losses, provide for mandatory price reporting for livestock sales, and the labeling of imported beef and lamb products. 
We were successful to some degree with those amendments. We passed three of those proposals through this Senate: a $500 million disaster relief assistance package for farmers, a pilot project for mandatory price reporting on captive supplies of live cattle and boxed beef, and an amendment which I offered that will label beef and lamb products for country of origin. However, now that we have gone through the August recess, we are into September, and we still have to convince the House conferees of the importance of these proposals. 
So we are back today because the economy in farm country and ranch country is getting, frankly, desperate. Since July, prices for cattle and crops have fallen further, and it seems at this point that there is almost no end in sight. 
My recent conversations with farmers and ranchers across my State have been alarming. Ranchers have been selling off their cattle herds. Farmers are applying for off-farm jobs in preparation of losing their farms. And farm-related businesses are laying off employees. Implement dealers are laying off mechanics. Sale barns and veterinarians are laying off their hired help as well. 
The ripple effect of this economic crisis has already hurt farmers and ranchers. But it is moving now quickly into our rural communities--and not just the small communities but the larger cities and towns as well. 
With that, my farm State colleagues and I are offering this farm relief legislation--this amendment. This legislation is crucially needed if we are going to improve, if we are going to step in the right direction with our farm economy. 
The first measure included in this package lifts the caps on marketing loans and extends the terms from 9 to 15 months. Again, we voted on this very same amendment earlier on on this Senate floor. We were defeated on a party-line vote at that time. But this amendment is the best way to provide farmers with an immediate economic impact for the grain products they produce. 
It would amend the Agriculture Marketing Transition Act--Freedom to Farm. As many of us know, it gives the President of the United States the authority to declare a state of emergency for producers affected for 1 year, removing the current loan rate caps, and extending the loan period from 9 to 15 months. 
Wheat would have the cap increased from the current $2.58 to $3.22, up 64 cents per bushel; corn from $1.89, the current cap, to $2.25, up 36 cents per bushel; and soybeans from $5.26 to $5.33, up 7 cents per bushel. 
This would build on the existing marketing loan that is in the current farm bill. This is not a revolutionary departure from the current farm bill. It simply extends and expands the caps to a point where they become meaningful. 
The Freedom to Farm, touted in the 1996 farm bill, did deliver the planting and management flexibility to farmers who are able to take advantage of that flexibility, but it failed to deliver freedom for farmers to market in a flexible manner and at a profitable manner. When the farm bill passed, wheat prices stood at nearly $6. Now, in some cases, it is down to $1.70. When the farm bill passed, corn was $5. Now it is $1.10 in some places. 
The financial progress and future viability of our farm and ranch operations depends on the profits that can be gained from our agricultural products. I think all of us support short-term disaster relief. And that is part of our package, too. But the long-term underlying challenge that we have is to create an environment in which the attendant market prices can be gained. Our farmers want, in the long run, to have a decent price for their products. They are not looking for government checks. They are not looking to go back to the old days of $26 billion a year in the farm program expenditures, although even that is only around half of what the European Community is spending today. But they want an environment where profitability is at least possible. 
When cash flow projections were developed last fall by farmers and creditors, better commodity prices were relied upon than what we see today. Keeping in mind the incredible, terrible prices that the farmers are now seeing, it is likely that we will see increased loan delinquencies and default rates in the coming months. So while producers are now essentially receiving prices comparable to what they received in the 1940s, their input and production costs reflect the modern-day realities of the 1990s. 
How many of us could make a decent living on 1940s wages and 1990s costs? We could not, and neither can the farmers nor the ranchers. So we are witnessing another devastating bout of farmers and ranchers going out of business. 
Second, this package will provide short-term disaster assistance. It will provide funding for income losses to farmers in the Dakotas, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana--all of the hard-hit rural areas of our Nation. 
We successfully passed a $500 million proposal as part of the coming fiscal year's Agriculture appropriations debate. But it is still tied up in conference and it doesn't take into account the recent disasters we have had in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, the devastating drought circumstances that currently exist there. 
Third, this package would provide for emergency storage payments. It provides for commodities placed under the marketing loans. It will allow farmers to store their grains during these low price cycles so they will be able to market them with an eye toward more profitability over a longer window every time. 
It would provide for mandatory price reporting creating a 3-year pilot program that requires meat packers to report prices on live cattle and boxed beef; allows the Secretary of Agriculture to define and prohibit anticompetitive practices. It strengthens the 1921 Packers and Stockyards Act; provides whistle-blower protection for smaller producers who speak out against captive supplies from business discrimination in the livestock industry; and, it would create a commission to study credit availability to determine if current lending practices on the part of the Federal Government contribute to the growing problem of concentration in agriculture. Lastly, and importantly to me, it would again reinvestigate the issue of labeling beef and lamb meat products. 
The Meat Labeling Act of 1998 was unanimously approved by the Senate during its deliberations of the 1999 Agriculture appropriations bill. The House, however, did not include it in its version of its Agriculture appropriations bill. Currently, we are tied up in conference. 
Again, this is commonsense legislation. We label virtually every product Americans purchase, whether it be T-shirts, auto parts, shoes, whatever. The one thing that is not labeled by country of origin is the food products we feed our families. 
This has the support of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the National Farmers Union, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and the American Sheep Industry Association. It has broad bipartisan support, and I am proud that the original Senate bill had the support of eight Republicans and nine Democratic Senators. 
Our livestock producers across this country have invested heavily in approved genetics, in marketing efforts, and in food safety in order to provide the best quality and safest food in the world to American consumers. But all too often they don't gain the benefit of those investments. 
With the Canadian producers sending over half their beef production into the United States today, I believe more than ever the time is ripe for American consumers to at least have the ability to judge for themselves whether or not they wish to buy a foreign product. They may choose to do so. That is their prerogative. There is nothing in the food labeling amendment that would prohibit imported meat products into the United States, but it would put us on par with what other countries in the world are doing. The European Community is going to be mandating country of origin food labeling by the year 2000 for all of their nations. Most other major consuming nations in the world also apply country of origin labeling to food as well as to other consumer products. 
This legislation, in short, is more than simply help for our livestock producers. It is endorsed by the National Consumers League, the Nation's oldest consumer organization. Once again, American consumers have a right to know the source of the food products they feed their families. 
Madam President, this particular effort is not anti free trade; it is common sense. I know there are some who say, on the one hand, that Americans may choose a foreign meat product. If they do so, that certainly is their prerogative. There are others who say no, Americans will choose American meat products. If they do so, again, it is their prerogative. There are those who are concerned that other nations will label country of origin on their food products. They already have. But even so, I have enough confidence, and obviously the American agricultural organizations, the key organizations that are in support of this amendment have equal confidence, that if any nation anywhere in the world wishes a stamp `Made in USA' on an American meat product, more power to them. We have confidence in our product. We think we can market with the country of origin label right now. 
Currently, Argentina, Australia, Bosnia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Korea, Latvia, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Russia, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela have some sort of meat labeling, with the E.C. soon to follow comprehensively by the year 2000. 
I have been meeting with Secretary Glickman as well as with Senator Larry Craig of Idaho, Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, and Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota to discuss the importance of this legislation to our farmers and ranchers as well as our consumers. I am pleased that Secretary Glickman has exhibited his willingness to work with us on this legislation to make country of origin meat labeling a reality. 
With these steps in the right direction, I do not believe that we will have resolved all of the crises that we have in American agriculture, but it will go a long way toward addressing both the short- and the long-term problems we face. We need, obviously, to address trade issues, we need to address rural development issues, ag research--all of them go together--if we are going to have the kind of comprehensive strategy that is necessary to maintain a strong rural America and an underlying strong level of support for a qualitative and abundant food supply for this Nation. 
At this time, there is no other package that comes as close as this does to addressing the urgent crises that we have in American agriculture. So I enthusiastically rise in support of this amendment and again commend ranking member Harkin for his tremendous leadership, as well as Senator Daschle for his work in making this amendment a reality. This is an opportunity to address this crisis. We are running out of time. We have 5 to 6 weeks remaining of this Congress. There are farmers and ranchers leaving the land as we speak. There are small businesses going broke as we speak. There is no time to wait. We need to move now on this legislation and get this to the President's desk as quickly as possible. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a critical issue which I fear has not received the attention it deserves. I am speaking about the Year 2000 computer problem which will strike in a mere sixteen months. 
The year 2000 holds potential problems for all Americans. At numerous hearings by the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Financial Services and Technology, on which I serve, witnesses have testified that the year 2000 problem involves more than just computers--it is a pervasive problem for which there is no quick fix. But fix it we must, because there can be no extension of time. 
I commend the efforts of Senator Bennett, Chairman of that Banking Subcommittee, for his tireless efforts to raise the profile of Y2K issues. Senator Bennett now chairs the joint task force on Y2K, and he will be a forceful advocate for the necessity of addressing this issue. 
Government, businesses, farms and homes rely on computers for nearly every aspect of their operations--from paying Social Security, to operating vehicles and equipment, to calculating interest, to conducting elections, to launching missiles. A failure in one computer system could not only be devastating to that particular operation, but could also have a domino effect. 
For these reasons, it is vitally important that government and the private sector work together to avoid a potential disaster. According to a recent General Accounting Office (GAO) study, the federal government is extremely vulnerable to year 2000 problems because of its widespread dependence on computer systems. 
The GAO study found uneven progress and made a number of recommendations for federal agencies to implement. Among them are the need to establish priorities, solidify data exchange agreements, and develop contingency plans. 
GAO testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee, on which I also serve, focused on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) computer systems. The GAO concluded that if not properly fixed, severe consequences could result such as: 
Payments to schools, farmers and others in rural communities could be delayed or incorrectly computed. 
The economy could be adversely affected if information critical to crop and livestock providers and investors is unreliable, late or unavailable. 
The import and export of foodstuffs could be delayed, thus increasing the likelihood that they will not reach their intended destinations before their spoilage dates. 
Food distribution to schools and others could be stopped or delayed. 
Public health and safety could be at risk if equipment used in USDA's many laboratories to detect bacteria, diseases, and unwholesome foods is not compliant. 
These are a few of the potential year 2000 computer problems in just one agency of the federal government. Many federal agencies have made tremendous progress in solving their computer problems, but many more have been remiss. Therefore, the role of the Administration through the President' Council on Year 2000 Conversion becomes even more important in ensuring the federal government's readiness for year 2000. 
I am encouraged by President Clinton's recent initiatives to increase national and global awareness of the Y2K problem and to facilitate private sector attempts to address it. The President's `Year 2000 Good Samaritan' legislation is designed to promote private sector exchange of year 2000-related information and would help our national preparedness for 2000. 
Y2K will not just impact the United States. In today's global economy, no area can remain isolated from any other. The United States also will contribute $12 million to assist the World Bank's plan to raise awareness of the problem in developing countries. 
I am also encouraged by the recent testing of Y2K compliance by Wall Street firms which are conducting a series of tests to see whether U.S. markets will face Y2K difficulties. These firms represent the type of foresight which will limit any dislocation caused by the Y2K glitch. This is the first known comprehensive effort to check the compliance of corporate America for the Y2K bug, and I hope more sectors of the economy quickly follow suit. 
The potential difficulties are almost incalculable, when we consider the tremendous role computers play in our everyday lives. From food distribution to air traffic control. From our monetary infrastructure to electric power grids. Telecommunications systems and traffic lights. All of these necessities we take for granted could be impacted on January 1, 2000. 
Congress must continue it's oversight to make certain that the necessary resources are brought to bear on this critical issue. We have made progress, but there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done. The clock is running, and we cannot afford to fail to meet the year 2000 deadline.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to ask unanimous consent that my name be added as a cosponsor to amendment number #3388 to the FY 1999 Treasury-Postal Appropriations legislation currently under consideration. This amendment is a combination of several amendments aimed at increasing support for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The Midwest HIDTA program has been extremely helpful to cracking down on drug trafficking in my rural state by coordinating federal, state and local law enforcement efforts to combat methamphetamine trafficking. While the Campbell-Kohl amendment addresses HIDTA programs nationwide, the Midwest HIDTA will be increased by $3.5 million, bringing the total methamphetamine elimination funding to $13 million for the Midwestern States of South Dakota, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and Kansas. The amendment will also add North Dakota to the Midwest HIDTA program which is crucial to tightening law enforcement's grip on meth traffickers in the area. I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues from Colorado and Wisconsin for recognizing that drug trafficking is not a uniquely coastal or urban problem, and that federal coordination and assistance is necessary for fighting drug use and trafficking nationwide.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, Senator Daschle is correct. In fact, the extensive damage in these units includes: severe racking due to the unit's design not holding up to wind; unlevel floors, sticking windows and doors, and cracking due to badly designed and constructed rim joists; collapse of interior ceilings caused by defective garage eaves, which allow heavy snow and rain to enter some attics; sewer gas back up due to improperly vented plumbing; deck and porch supports and stairs that have separated from the units and become unlevel because caissons supporting these structures were not placed below the frost line; and other problems both with the work done and problems resulting from work required by the contract but never completed by the Corporation. Despite these serious problems, the Air Force continues to pay rent on these units.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The two parties have met with a mediator appointed by the Justice Department and have had several subsequent meetings to continue negotiating an agreement. I have been told that the next meeting between the Air Force and HBC will be next week. Although some progress has been made, it is critically important that the negotiations between the Air Force and HBC result in a timely, workable resolution that guarantees the expeditious repair of the housing units and the return of military personnel to the homes. While it is my understanding that the Department of Justice has been looking into this matter for some time and is considering litigation against HBC if no resolution can be found through the mediation process, I am hopeful that action by the Department of Justice can be avoided.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support as a cosponsor of S. 1905, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act of 1998. This extremely important issue is the highest priority for the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe and will have a positive and lasting impact on the Cheyenne River reservation community and the entire State of South Dakota. I have worked closely with the Indian Affairs Committee to insure that this legislation protects the future interests of tribal members, and I am pleased that the bill reported by the Committee reflects these concerns. I am committed to seeing that the bill receive strong Senate support, and look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the bill moves forward for approval by the full Senate. 
The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act would establish a trust fund within the Department of the Treasury for the development of certain tribal infrastructure projects for the Cheyenne River Tribe as compensation for lands lost to federal public works projects. The trust fund would be capitalized from a small percentage of hydropower revenues and would be capped at $290 million. Independent research has concluded that the economic loss to the tribe justifies such a compensation fund. The tribe would then receive the interest from the fund to be used according to a development plan based on legislation previously passed by Congress, and prepared in conjunction with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service. 
This type of funding mechanism has seen unanimous support in the Congress though recent passage of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe Infrastructure Development Trust Fund Act as well as the Crow Creek legislation passed last Congress. Precedent for these infrastructure development trust funds capitalized through hydro-power revenue was established with the Three Affiliated Tribes and Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act of 1992, which set up a recovery fund financed entirely from a percentage of Pick-Sloan power revenues to compensate the tribes for lands lost to Pick-Sloan. 
I believe it is important for the Senate to understand the historic context of this proposed compensation. As you may know, the Flood Control Act of 1944 created five massive earthen dams along the Missouri River. Known as the Pick-Sloan Plan, this public works project has since provided much-needed flood control, irrigation, and hydropower for communities along the Missouri. Four of the Pick-Sloan dams are located in South Dakota and the benefits of the project have proven indispensable to the people of my State. 
Unfortunately, construction of the Big Bend and Fort Randall dams was severely detrimental to economic and agricultural development for several of South Dakota's tribes, including Cheyenne River. Over 100,000 acres of the tribe's most fertile and productive land, the basis for the tribal economy, were inundated, forcing the relocation of roughly 30 percent of the tribe's population, including four entire communities. 
The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act of 1998 will enable the Cheyenne River Tribe to address and improve their infrastructure and will provide the needed resources for further economic development within the Cheyenne River reservation community. However, the damage caused by the Pick-Sloan projects touched every aspect of life in South Dakota, on and off reservation. The economic development goal targeted in this approach is a pressing issue for surrounding communities off reservation as well, because every effort toward healthy local economies in rural South Dakota resonates throughout the State. 
Language included in this bill would prohibit any increase in power rates in connection with the trust fund. This legislation has broad support in South Dakota. South Dakota Governor Bill Janklow has endorsed this type of funding mechanism for the compensation of South Dakota tribes, and fully supports S. 1905. 
Mr. President, the tribes in my State experience some of the most extreme poverty and unemployment in this country. Under the current Chairman, Gregg Bourland, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe has been a leader in economic development initiatives within the reservation community and I believe this bill will reinforce and further the economic development successes of the tribe. I look forward to educating my colleagues about the importance of this bill to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and I encourage swift Senate action on this bill.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I share the sentiment of the Senator from Montana. This is a profoundly bad piece of public policy that should never have appeared on the floor of this body in the first place. 
The question is not whether we are for tax reform or not tax reform. There is no such strawman to knock down. 
The question is not only where will we go at the end of 4 1/2 years, for which the sponsors and supporters of this amendment seem to have utterly no answer, but what happens in the intervening years? 
The answer has been clearly laid out by the business community of this country, which is overwhelmingly opposed to this legislation, and by the thoughtful analysts, who also are overwhelmingly opposed to this legislation. What happens during the intervening 4 1/2 years of debate as we struggle with whatever might come next is that business cannot make an investment in a knowing fashion--whether it is concern about capital gains, or depreciation tables, investment deductions, whether it is individual citizens with their home mortgage, whether it is questions about research and development tax credits, whether it is questions about the future of pension law. The uncertainty will freeze the American economy in a way that will assuredly slow down economic growth, lead to lost income, and lead to deficit spending once again. 
Mr. President, there is a good reason why the business community and responsible business groups all across this country have so vigorously opposed this legislation. They recognize this amendment for the bumper sticker sloganeering that, frankly, it is. 
There was a time early on in this debate when supporters of this legislation noted that they felt this is a absolute political winner, an opportunity to beat up on the Tax Code, which has no real supporters, and on the IRS besides, without having to be accountable, at least in the course of this election, for the ultimate results of this legislation. 
An interesting thing happened in the meantime, however. Some poll work was done by the Republican National Committee showing that a majority of voters in America already recognize this as a reckless move--reckless. That is the finding of the American public which already understands the political nature of what we have here--a bumper sticker to abolish the Tax Code. It sounds good, if you are at the coffee shop. We are not at the coffee shop. We are Members of the U.S. Senate. And it is our responsibility to chart the economic welfare of this Nation into the next century in a responsible fashion that continues our economic growth in the coming years and which recognizes that business needs certainty. 
We can talk about tax reform, and we will do tax reform. I invite additional debate on that issue. But to simply abolish a Tax Code with no utter idea of what comes next in the meantime, during which American business is left to fend for itself figuring out how to invest billions and billions of dollars, is a sure recipe for disaster. 
I have a sense that this amendment is not intended to pass. The reason we are here is not to make public policy. The reason, frankly, we are here debating this issue is because there are some who want a slogan for the coming election in November. 
I think that is regrettable. I think the American people deserve better than that. Our economy needs better than that. 
I think this is irresponsible legislation. 
I see a colleague of ours on the floor, Senator Kohl of Wisconsin. I see others who have significant business success in their own careers. I have to wonder whether Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey, who spoke against this amendment, who created a massively successful business enterprise in his home State of New Jersey, whether he could possibly have gotten off the ground in his business with the kind of uncertainty that would, in fact, be created by this legislation. 
Mr. President, the question is not tax reform, or not tax reform. We all agree, I believe, that we need tax reform, and we need to push in that direction. But this is sloganeering. This is pandering. This is sham reform. The American public deserves better than this. 
It also violates the Budget Act. I need not remind my colleagues that it is the Budget Act that is responsible for bringing us 5 years in succession of declining budgets. Budget deficits, which were $292 billion a year, are now a budget surplus because we abided by the Budget Act. 
Now, to violate that and to set up a recipe for the destruction of our economy is utter irresponsibility. We deserve better than that. The American public deserves better than that.

We are privileged to work in these hallowed buildings that are central to the greatest democracy in the world. We are equally privileged that Officers Chestnut and Gibson and their colleagues are willing to risk their lives to defend us from harm and keep democracy alive. 
Capitol Police Officers protect more than 7 million visitors who come to our Nation's Capitol every year. Often, they are the first to welcome these visitors to our Capitol. I thank all the officers who secure our grounds and dedicate their lives to our safety. 
Officers Chestnut and Gibson and their families are in our thoughts and our prayers, but we also should remember to pray for the safety of hundreds of other men and women who protect us everyday as we do the business of the American people. This tragedy should remind all of us that our democracy and our nation's security are ultimately dependent upon the courage and commitment of individuals such as Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will correct an unintended oversight in the federal administration of Native American housing programs, allowing Indian tribes to once again access Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) for housing development in some of this nation's most under-served communities. Joining me as original cosponsors of this bill are Senators Inhofe, Baucus, Conrad, Bryan, Kerry, Bumpers, Snowe, Boxer, Daschle, Burns and Inouye. 
In the 104th Congress, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act (NAHASDA) was signed into law, separating Indian housing from public housing and providing block grants to tribes and their tribally designated housing authorities. Prior to passage of NAHASDA, Indian tribes receiving HOME block grant funds were able to use those funds to leverage the Low Income Housing Tax Credits distributed by states on a competitive basis. Unfortunately, unlike HOME funds, block grants to tribes under the new NAHASDA are defined as federal funds and cannot be used for accessing LIHTCs. 
The fact that tribes cannot use their new block grant funds to access a program (LIHTC) which they formerly could access is an unintended consequence of taking Indian Housing out of Public Housing at HUD and setting up the otherwise productive and much needed NAHASDA system. The legislation I am introducing today is limited in scope and redefines NAHASDA funds, restoring tribal eligibility for the LIHTC by putting NAHASDA funds on the same footing as HOME funds. With this technical correction, there would be no change to the LIHTC programs--tribes would compete for LIHTCs with all other entities at the state level, just as they did prior to NAHASDA. 
This technical corrections legislation is a minor but much needed fix to a valuable program that will restore equity to housing development across the country. The South Dakota Housing Development Authority has enthusiastically endorsed this legislation out of concern for equitable treatment of every resident of our state and to reinforce the proven success of the LIHTC program for housing development in rural and lower income communities. 
I have joined many of my colleagues in past efforts to preserve and increase the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program which benefits every state, and I ask my colleagues to recognize the importance of maintaining fairness in access to this program emphasized through this legislation and encourage my colleagues to support passage of this vital legislation.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to address the overall issue of the legislation before the Senate, H.R. 1151. 
I want, first, to commend Chairman D'Amato and the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, for their help in this legislation getting to the floor in a timely fashion. 
I will not address the issue raised by my colleague from Texas. I know there are others who will want to talk about that at much greater length. 
There is an underlying legitimate debate there about whether an industry that benefits from Federal insurance, Federal regulation assuring that industry's stability and long-term viability, should, in turn, have to commit itself to making investments back into its own community or not. That debate can go forward. But I want to talk briefly about the underlying bill. 
As we all, I think, understand, following the Supreme Court's decision earlier this year, the credit union membership of some 20 million credit union members all across America has been in some jeopardy. There was initially legislation offered in the other body that was designed simply to overturn the Supreme Court decision. The other body chose not to do that. Nevertheless, they did reach a compromise bill that passed in April on an overwhelmingly vote of 411-8. 
Following that debate, and passage of that legislation, the Senate Banking Committee took up our version of credit union legislation, with the understanding that prompt action was in fact needed. But again, rather than simply choosing to overturn the Supreme Court decision and rather than simply choosing to pass the legislation passed in the House, the Senate Banking Committee crafted its own version, strengthening significantly the language of that original H.R. 1151. 
Now, there is a compromise involved here. Most Members in this body, and many Americans, are members of both credit unions and banks. It is important that they both be viable, strong contributors to our national economy. It has always been--and it is the nature of compromises--that some will go away not entirely satisfied, but, on the other hand, we can reach that balance that will allow both the banking and credit union industries to go forward in a fair and competitive fashion. That certainly, at least, is the goal of this legislation. 
So in the course of crafting this bill, we were able to arrive at bipartisan agreements on the level of restraint on expansion of credit unions that ought to be put into legislative language. There are some who would rather have no restraint whatsoever; others would rather have much greater restraint on what definition of `common bond' is used. We did reach a level of restraint in our legislation that, for the first time, now exists. I think perhaps, most importantly, the Senate Banking Committee adopted the Treasury Department's recommendations on safety and soundness. 
I think one of the greatest concerns all of us have had in this body is to make sure that if we are going to have an industry that is growing and prosperous, that it have underlying regulatory safety and soundness provisions that are really necessary for its long-term viability and for the confidence of the American consumers--not to mention the confidence the taxpayers ought to be able to have that they will not be called upon at some future time to bail out an industry that may have failed for lack of adequate safety and soundness provisions. I think one of the most important parts of the Senate response to the crisis that we have faced this year is stronger safety and soundness provisions and the adoption of the Treasury's recommendations. 
The committee also took up the issue of restraint on commercial lending--or member business loans, as they are sometimes referred to--which now, for the first time, is in place. Again, there are those who would have much more severe restrictions and those who would have no restrictions and ask why any restrictions ought to exist over and above our safety and soundness standards. But this compromise was reached, and I think it is one that is supported by the credit union industry and is supported by the consumer groups as well. And the Senate committee chose to retain language on CRA--or `CRA-light' as it is sometimes referred to--that was instituted by the other body when they took up H.R. 1151. 
Again, there are those who would like to see a much more rigorous, aggressive approach to CRA taken, and there are those who are simply philosophically disinclined to support any kind of CRA, even though this `light' version is simply a direction to the regulator of credit unions to come up with some assurance that, in fact, credit unions are investing in their local communities, which certainly has always been the case, although now there are larger credit unions with billions of dollars of capital, and some question is raised there. In any event, this is a provision that is accepted by the industry. 
We need a strong banking industry and we need a strong credit union industry. They both have legitimate, important roles to play in the provision of credit across America. In my State of South Dakota, with some 700,000 citizens, almost 200,000 of them belong to credit unions. We have historically a long track record of utilization of cooperative ventures, whether it is our rural electric, telephone co-ops, or other agricultural cooperatives across the State. We have that long tradition, one that has contributed significantly to affording more options, a greater level of economic prosperity, to a great number of people across rural America.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, we have minimal time remaining in this 105th Congress. The schedule is full. We have virtually the entire budget still to do, and other key issues are facing us. Frankly, we cannot afford to have this legislation held up with vetoes, veto threats, with ongoing, never-ending negotiations. So I think it is very important that we move forward with this legislation. 
A veto threat has been issued by the White House. If the CRA provisions are taken out--the `CRA-light' provisions--we will lose our bipartisanship, and it is a provision that is supported by the industry itself. It would appear to me that we need to move forward expeditiously with this legislation. We will be taking up bank regulatory relief legislation later on this coming week perhaps. There will be other vehicles in which to debate some of these extraneous matters dealing with the banking industry and, peripherally, the credit union industry. But I think it would be a mistake for us to be caught up in too many side issues on the underlying bill here. 
There is an absolute urgency that we move this bill forward. If we do not, the membership of some 20 million Americans will, in fact, be in very real and very great jeopardy. So with the legislation that passed 411-8 in the House, passed the Senate Banking Committee by a 16-2 vote, it would be my hope that this coming week we could conclude debate on this bill, obviously, with the adequate consideration of well-intended amendments, hopefully limited in number, but then get this bill in its current form onto the President's desk for signature. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by Senators Kyl and Bryan with respect to gambling on the Internet. I am an original cosponsor of S. 474, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act of 1997, as introduced in March of last year. I also sponsored the House version of this legislation in the 104th Congress because I am committed to preventing children's access to gambling on the Internet and the harm to the American public in general that is sure to follow unregulated gaming. 
Gambling in this country has always been a very regulated activity no matter where it takes place. Unfortunately, we are now faced with a potential explosion of unregulated gambling--gambling on the Internet. States have become so concerned about this problem that state attorney's general nationwide have filed suits against gambling operators on the Internet. The Kyl-Bryan amendment clearly defines objectionable internet activity and establishes guidelines for law enforcement to crack down on those who solicit wagering on-line. The bill applies existing laws against telephone betting or wagering to all electronic communications. This Internet gambling ban will be applied to those who accept bets and those who do the betting. 
While the Internet provides our children with many educational opportunities, we must closely scrutinize the industry to ensure that children are not let into the world of unregulated gambling. Preventing children or addicted gamblers from being able to gamble in an unregulated fashion on their home computer must be one of our highest priorities as we venture into the new and dynamic area of regulating electronic commerce. 
However, as important as the Internet gambling ban legislation is to protecting this nation's children, I feel compelled to state my concerns about the impact of several provisions included in the pending version of the Internet gambling ban legislation as they may impact Indian tribes. I want to take this opportunity to express my strong support for Senator Craig's second degree amendment aimed at addressing several of these provisions. Under the Kyl amendment, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) would be amended without any involvement or input by the committee of jurisdiction, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, or any tribal consultation. 
Senator Craig's amendment would make certain that currently lawful activities fully regulated by the federal government and permitted under the IGRA are not impacted by the Kyl amendment. I believe the Craig amendment is not a carve-out or loophole for Indians, but merely aims to preserve the IGRA process. The Craig amendment does not allow for any new type of Indian gaming. Our emphasis today ought to focus on unregulated internet gaming. To the extent that Congress deals with regulated Indian gaming, it should do so in separate legislation with tribal input. 
Like Senator Craig, I do not want to encourage special treatment or special exemptions for Indian tribes. I just expect equitable treatment of currently lawful gaming activities by tribes and, most importantly, I expect the Senate to respect the committee of jurisdiction on this issue and invite the input of impacted Indian tribes. 
As the Indian tribes in my state will attest, Indian Gaming is a regulated industry. Poverty, unemployment, poor health and welfare dominate much of reservation life across the country. With budget cuts to the BIA and other federal support programs for Indians, Congress must continue to encourage economic self sufficiency at the tribal level. If there are shortcomings with the effectiveness of the current IGRA, they should be addressed with tribal consultation. I am troubled at the prospect of Internet gambling sites opened by any entity, but again, so far as this concern deals with already regulated Indian gaming, it ought to be addressed in separate legislation. 
Nationwide, approximately 98 percent of all tribes use the revenue generated by casinos and bingo operations to provide housing, health services, and education to tribal members. Federal law requires tribal governments to use gaming revenue to fund these essential services. It is properly up to each tribe to determine for itself whether it wants to permit regulated gaming within its boundaries. Frankly, I would prefer that other types of economic activity would take hold in Indian country, but I also recognize that in the eyes of many tribal leaders, gaming has proven to be the only successful economic growth option that has worked. Our nation must have tightly regulated Indian gaming, but the ultimate decision whether to permit gaming on a particular reservation should be with the tribe itself. I am committed to protecting the interests of tribes in my state and across the country as they explore economic development through lawful gaming ventures. 
Like many of my colleagues, I realize that this debate is clear evidence of the pressing need for Congress to revisit existing Indian gaming regulations and law. I will urge the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to continue moving forward on this matter. 
Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of S. 474, I am nevertheless committed to the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act because the bottom line of this legislation is protecting our citizens and especially our kids. I am aware that the Justice Department believes overall enforcement of this law will be difficult, but I feel strongly that the time has come for Congress to push this issue and instruct Justice to develop the necessary enforcement capabilities and end unlawful Internet gambling. I will support the Senators from Arizona and Nevada, and will work with the Senators and the conferees on this appropriations bill to address the remaining issues of concern to tribes.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to update the Senate on my efforts to enhance statewide emergency warning systems in South Dakota. A person only has to open up a newspaper or watch the evening news to learn of the latest plight afflicting some region of the country. In recent years, our nation has been continuously ravaged by natural disasters, ranging from mudslides in California, massive flooding in the Midwest, as well as the annual hurricane and tornado seasons. These disasters have resulted in fatalities, enormous property damage, and has caused lingering disruptions of entire communities. This has never been more evident then this year, as our nation continues to feel the effects of the weather anomaly known as El Nino. Since August 1992, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has calculated that twenty-one weather-related disasters caused a staggering $90 billion in damages and resulted in over 900 fatalities. 
South Dakota has by no means escaped Mother Nature's destructive path. Last year, South Dakota was plagued by severe weather conditions, beginning with record snowfalls in January and February, and the worst flooding in the state's history in April and May. Many residents were displaced from their homes, and the final cost for clean-up and assistance total in the millions of dollars. This year has been no different. Heavy rains have once again flooded homes and farmland in the northeast part of the state. 
Recently, a tornado touched down with very little warning, completely destroying the town of Spencer, South Dakota. The Spencer disaster made me realize that additional efforts need to be made in order to provide citizens with the earliest possible warning of imminent danger. In my efforts to find new ways to update South Dakota's antiquated early warning system, it was brought to my attention that an immediate solution to upgrading the system would be the use of NOAA Weather Radios.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, renewable alternative fuels benefit energy security, the environment, and our overall economy. The amendment being offered today by Senator Craig and myself is critically important to soybean farmers across the country, and will do a great deal to give the ag economy a shot in the arm in states which produce soybeans. 
Since the Farm Bill took affect two years ago, soybean prices have dropped 15 percent, costing soybean producers in South Dakota about a hundred million dollars in lost revenue. The Craig/Johnson amendment could help offset these losses by boosting soybean prices an average of 11 cents a bushel and generating about $10 million in additional revenue for South Dakota soybean farmers and more than $300 million for soybean farmers nationwide without costing taxpayers one dime. 
This amendment makes changes to the Energy Policy Act of 1992. As most know, EPACT was enacted to stimulate the research and development of technologies which can potentially shift the focus of national energy demand away from imported oil and toward renewable or domestically produced energy sources. One component of energy consumption on which EPACT focuses is significantly reducing the amount of imported oil used by the transportation sector. The stated goal in EPACT is to replace 10 percent of petroleum by the year 2000 and 30 percent by the year 2010 with alternative fuels. 
This amendment is necessary because unfortunately, EPACT's current mandates and incentive structure essentially exclude some alternative fuels, such as biodiesel, from being an option for controlled fleet owners and operators. Further, the amendment will aid in the achievement of EPACT's goals of strengthening America's energy security through the substitution of domestically produced alternative fuels for imported petroleum products in the transportation sector. The latter point is important because this country is making extremely poor progress toward meeting the petroleum displacement goals of EPACT, and even federal fleets are not in compliance with the requirements of this statute. 
However, it is my understanding that Senators Bumpers and Rockefeller have some concerns about the impact the amendment will have on other alternative fuels currently eligible under EPACT. Is that correct?

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the Senate has accepted the Meat Labeling Act of 1998 as an amendment to S. 2159, the Agricultural Appropriations Bill of 1998 which provides appropriations for FY 1999 for the United States Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and other related agencies. 
As we all know, we can easily determine which country manufactured the automobiles we drive through country of origin labeling. We can easily tell where our clothing was made by simply looking at the label or tag on our shirts or trousers. And also, we can easily determine where our computers, stereos, and telephones were made by simply looking at the products' label. But, surprisingly, when we go to the grocery store to purchase meat products for our families to eat, we have no idea where that meat originated. 
Throughout my service in the United States Congress, I have been a strong believer in country of origin labeling for products--whether it be for automobiles, clothing, technological, or food products. I have been an especially strong supporter of country of origin labeling for meat products because of its common-sense nature, its benefits to ranchers, farmers, and consumers, its strong bipartisan and agricultural group support, its cost-free benefit to taxpayers as scored by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and its trade friendly provisions. 
After many years of effort to pass meat labeling legislation, we have finally succeeded. I would like to thank Senator Craig for his strong support and willingness to work with me, as well as Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Bumpers. 
In April of 1997, I introduced, along with Senators Craig, Daschle, Burns, and Baucus S. 617, the Meat Labeling Act of 1997, which would require that beef and lamb products be labeled for country of origin so consumers can make the choice to buy meat produced from livestock raised on American ranches and farms. 
Since my introduction of S. 617, the Meat Labeling Act of 1997, received the strong bipartisan support of 16 of my colleagues--8 Democrats and 8 Republicans. Also, it has enjoyed the enthusiastic support of every major agricultural organization including the National Farmers Union, the American Farm Bureau, the National Cattlemens Beef Association, and the American Sheep Institute. 
The amendment that has been accepted by the Senate, the Meat Labeling Act of 1998, has the same country of origin labeling spirit in mind but has been modified slightly from S. 617. My amendment requires beef and lamb meat products to be labeled as imported and allows for voluntary labeling of those beef and lamb products for their country of origin. 
The Meat Labeling Act of 1998 is designed in the following way. My amendment requires beef and lamb meat products to be labeled as imported beef or imported lamb, and it permits imported beef and lamb to bear a label identifying the country-of-origin. US beef and lamb would also bear labels of designation. Finally, beef and lamb products blended with beef or lamb from the US and another country would bear a blended label. 
Also, the Meat Labeling Act of 1998 creates a voluntary labeling study for ground beef or lamb. As you may know, ground beef (hamburger) and lamb are the remains of meat carcasses after they are utilized for the prime cuts. My legislation recognizes the difficulties in determining the exact country of origin status of the ground beef or lamb and therefore, does not mandate it to be labeled for country of origin immediately. 
Instead, my legislation is designed to allow a study of the impact and costs to producers, processors, and consumers of labels for ground beef or lamb. After one year of voluntary labeling, the United States Secretary of Agriculture will then take six months to determine the costs, benefits, and impacts of voluntary labeling and if the Secretary deems it to be cost effective and beneficial to all involved then the labeling of ground beef and lamb will become effective. 
As we all know, America's ranchers and farmers are very proud of the fine beef and lamb products they produce. This legislation reflects that pride our ranchers and farmers have in their products. In fact, ranchers and farmers throughout South Dakota tell me over and over that when America's consumers have a choice between US beef or imported beef, consumers will chose US beef because of its quality and its nutritional value. 
The benefits to consumers are many. First of all, consumers have the right to know where their food is produced because of prices, quality, taste, safety, etc. If passed, this legislation will finally permit the competitive free market to determine the demand and price of beef and lamb meat products through consumer choice. 
Also, a national survey in December 1995 found 74 percent of consumers favored labeling; 51 percent would buy American produce, even if it cost more than imports of equal quality and appearance. Furthermore, an April 1997 survey conducted in Florida showed that 96 percent consumers surveyed strongly agreed that food products should have a country of origin. 
Clearly, this evidence shows that American consumers want country of origin labeling for the food they eat. 
Labeling is affordable. Preliminary estimates from USDA show that labeling meat may cost an estimated 20 CENTS per customer per year. 
This legislation is consistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT.) Most of our major trading partners, including Canada, Japan, Australia and the EU, require country of origin labeling for produce and meat products. This legislation simply levels the playing field for our producers and consumers. 
Clearly, the Meat Labeling Act of 1998 is broadly supported by American producers and consumers. It enjoys strong bipartisan support in Congress, is endorsed by every major agricultural organization, incurs zero costs to taxpayers, and benefits consumers in numerous ways. 
I would like share from you part of a recent letter I received from the major agricultural organization supporting my legislation: 
`Consumers demand quality and consistency, and producers are continually working to meet consumer demands. With the current system, there is limited ability to identify the source of product that does not meet consumer demands. Import labeling will help differentiate products in the retail meat case and increase competition among product lines. With labeling, consumers will have the ability to make informed decisions when purchasing meat and meat products an the relative value of meat from different product lines will be determined through competitive forces in the marketplace.'

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on the night of May 30 a powerful tornado devastated the small community of Spencer, South Dakota. The tornado destroyed ninety percent of the town, injured 150 people, and, most tragically, killed six South Dakotans. I am pleased to say the positive determination of the residents of Spencer to rebuild their lives has been inspirational and all of the surviving victims are making progress toward returning their lives to some semblance of normality. 
Unfortunately tornadoes are all too common in my state, however one aspect of the Spencer tornado caught my attention right away--that is the fact the warning siren did not sound because the electricity had been blown out. I recognize that the tornado which hit Spencer was so powerful that sounding a warning siren may not have spared the residents of Spencer the total destruction of their community. However, reports of the lack of a warning from the siren in Spencer prompted a statewide focus on the quality of the emergency alert capability around my state of South Dakota. Unfortunately, almost every county in my state has acknowledged that it urgently needs some sort of emergency alert upgrade. 
Mr. President, my guess is that South Dakota is not unique in that the emergency alert system for tornadoes is inadequate in virtually every part of the state. I suspect many states have never systematically examined their emergency alert systems and how needs have changed since the civil defense sirens were initially erected and technology advanced. 
I am hopeful that at least one positive development to come out of the devastation of the Spencer tornado can be legislative action to address the emergency alert needs across the state of South Dakota and this nation. Consequently, I have proposed the creation of Tornado Preparedness Pilot Program to be administered by Region VIII of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
Mr. President, this pilot program would provide $1 million from the Emergency Planning and Assistance appropriation for grants directly to local and county emergency management officials in South Dakota to provide 75% of the cost of purchasing emergency alert equipment. Examples of emergency alert equipment eligible for purchase under this Tornado Preparedness Pilot Program includes: new sirens with back-up capability, siren upgrade equipment, weather radio transmitters, weather radios and other emergency alert equipment. 
This pilot program would be an excellent first step in establishing a nationwide Tornado Preparedness Program much like the Hurricane Preparedness Grant Program and an Earthquake Hazards Reduction Grant Program which currently exist. 
Further, I think South Dakota is the appropriate state to conduct this pilot program because in the wake of the tragic Spencer tornado, awareness has been elevated all over the state of South Dakota about the critical importance of high quality, effective emergency alert capability. Our state is now ready to aggressively deal with this problem. Additionally a large, rural state like South Dakota has unique needs. For example, many South Dakotans need a different kind of alert system than sirens because they live in a remote area. Most small communities lack the tax base to fully fund a siren upgrade or the purchase of additional sirens. Also, the terrain of the Black Hills of South Dakota presents challenges for transmitter coverage and also for adequate siren coverage. 
Senator Mikulski, do you support my proposal to create a Tornado Preparedness Pilot Program in the State of South Dakota?

Data available from the National Climatic Data Center shows that in every year in the '90s our country has experienced close to or over 1,100 tornados each year. Mr. Chairman, do you agree that the pilot program I have proposed would be useful not only in terms of meeting the needs in South Dakota, but also in terms of providing this nation a model for the future to be used to increase emergency alert capabilities across the country?

Mr. JOHNSON. As I understand the immediate amendment before the Senate having to do with marketing loans, it strikes me, and I wonder if the Senator shares this view, that we need to put this in some perspective. There are some who view this as a debate on Freedom to Farm, and certainly there are those of us who have widely and varied opinions on that underlying legislation. But the amendment that is pending, does the Senator agree, does not unravel or turn inside out or otherwise dispose of the Freedom to Farm legislation? 
The amendment, as I see it before me, builds on what is already in the existing farm bill; that is, a marketing loan provision that is already there, at an inadequate level, but it is there, and the amendment that is pending simply gives the President of the United States the authority in a state of emergency for 1 year to remove the current loan caps and raise the cap on wheat from $2.58 a bushel to $3.22, on corn from $1.89 to $2.25, on soybeans from $5.26 to $5.33 and extend the loan period from 9 months to 15 months? 
Would the Senator agree that this is not a radical amendment? This is not an amendment that somehow sweeps away the previous legislation--and we have different opinions about what ought to happen--but this amendment, it would seem to me, is a very modest, in fact, very narrowly crafted and a very modest change in what is already existing law. Would the Senator agree with that point on this issue?

Mr. JOHNSON. Well, may I ask the Senator from North Dakota--I applaud his work on this amendment. I have long supported his concept of targeted assistance for family producers in this context and various others. We have discussed this over the years. But when we expand the loan period from 9 to 15 months, if the producers are required to sell their product within a shorter window of time, does that depress the price further? And who gains by producers having to sell their grain within a shorter window of time than over a longer window of time? Who are the winners and who are the losers when all of the farmers are required, within a relatively short window, to dispose of their grain at one time? Who wins and who loses by that policy?

Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I will be very brief. I commend my colleague from Indiana for his sponsorship of this amendment to the agriculture appropriations bill. In my view, it is long overdue that this Senate develops a more thoughtful, more deliberative, a more analytical approach to our sanctions strategy on the part of the United States. 
An observer noted during this discussion last week that Congress is in general opposed to sanctions, but in specific supports each one of them that comes along--all too often, sanctions that are contradictory, that are counterproductive, that do not, in fact, carry out the goals of the sanctions themselves. So I think the framework that Senator Lugar of Indiana has developed, which would cause us to approach this in a much more analytical perspective--to see to it that we have a cost-effectiveness that results from our sanctions, or even if it doesn't, that we deal with the sanction from that perspective--I think makes all the sense in the world. 
It is true that sanctions most often are effective when they are multinational in nature. There is nothing, as I understand Senator Lugar's amendment, that says we can only engage in multinational sanctions. We can engage in unilateral sanctions if we so choose. We can engage in sanctions that may not be cost-effective, if we so choose. But we ought to be fully cognizant of the nature of the sanctions and their consequences if, in fact, we are going to go down those roads. It is not tying our hands, it is not tying the hands of American foreign policy or trade policy or economic policy, to know with certainty what it is we are doing and to approach it in the kind of thoughtful manner that Senator Lugar suggests. 
There is nothing in this amendment, as I see it, that constitutes the development of an entitlement for foreign aid or anything of that nature. I think that is a gross misreading, not only of the intent, but the actual effect of this amendment. There is nothing that would restrict the ability of the American Government to impose sanctions as a response to terrorism or genocide or the development of weapons of mass destruction. It does not tie our hands in that regard. 
I want to say that I think we made a step in the right direction this past week with the handling of the sanctions that were about to be imposed on Pakistan in terms of agricultural sales. I think it is appropriate that this amendment be brought up in the context of this particular bill. 
Again, I thank the Senator from Indiana for a great deal of work, a great deal of thought and care that has gone into this. The foreign policy of the United States and oversight that this body, the U.S. Senate, can exercise will be enhanced and not detracted from by the adoption of this amendment. 
I yield back my time.

Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator from Iowa for his extraordinary leadership under these very trying circumstances. 
One of the points that the Senator was making earlier struck me as particularly important in terms of the long-term future of rural America and the long-term capability of our Nation to feed not only our citizens but also much of the rest of the world. The Senator from Iowa was talking about what kind of structure we would have in rural America if we go particularly down the road of more and more concentration and vertical integration. It struck me that there may be other societies that have gone down that road from whom we can learn a lesson or two. 
I am reminded of the agricultural regime in the former Soviet Union and their efforts to turn agricultural workers into paid employees rather than people who have a personal family stake in the outcome of their agricultural enterprise, 
and what that led to in terms of taking a nation with enormous natural resources, that had historically been one of the bread baskets of the world and what that did to that nation in terms of destroying its infrastructure of small rural communities, what it did ultimately to destroy its ability to produce food shipments for itself and for its neighbors. 
I would wonder and question the Senator from Iowa whether he thinks there are some lessons to be learned from other societies that have destroyed family agriculture, then discovered it was a mistake, then discovered that turning family agriculture up by the roots is not so easily replanted and what happens after you have gone down that road, if you decide that you want to reestablish family agriculture after you have ripped it up by the roots in that manner? I wonder if the Senator will comment about the long-term structure that we are headed to if we continue down this road.

Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator agree that one of the things this institution needs to do is step back and recover its institutional memory, its recognition of why we arrived at the price support system in the first place, going back as long ago as the 1930s and the agricultural stabilization service? There was a recognized need then, generations ago. 
Family agriculture, it would seem to me, cannot sustain itself without some stabilizing force. Otherwise, they simply will not be capitalized well enough. They will be driven off the land, just as what was happening at that time, and we need that kind of a presence not to micromanage, not to deny the flexibility that our farmers need to meet the forces in the market, but that they need an opportunity to compete fairly with a more stable kind of environment. We, in fact, are losing sight of that--assuming that the $6 wheat when Freedom to Farm was passed would be here forever, that the $5 corn when Freedom to Farm was passed would be here forever--and we find it out only a few years later, conveniently after the next elections, when prices have declined. 
Does the Senator concur that a handful of years of declining transition payments, a pat on the back and a `good luck, buddy,' is not a reasoned, long-term strategy for family agriculture and the provision of food in this Nation, and now that there is great urgency, we need to step back and accept that that was misguided? We do not need micromanagement, we do not need bureaucracy-laden policies, but we do need something that will provide the kind of stability that, as long as 60 years ago, was recognized as necessary when, if anything, we are in a more volatile world market situation now than we were then? Does the Senator concur with those observations?

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support of legislation passed by the Senate last evening, the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. 
The Higher Education Act has been of enormous benefit to millions of students over the past three decades in providing more affordable access to institutions of post-secondary education. Many of these students simply would not have gone to college or vocational school without the assistance provided through such programs as Pell Grants, student loans, and work study. 
With the increased competition faced by workers in the global economy, the importance of these programs is even greater today, not only for students but also for our nation's economy. The Higher Education Act programs account for 68 percent of all financial aid available to students. 
The cost of a college education continues to grow far faster than inflation, leaving more and more students with a large debt once they finish. Last fall, the College Board released a nationwide survey of tuition costs, finding that tuition and fees would rise about 5 percent for the fifth year in a row. 
In contrast, inflation in the overall economy has been held under control during these years, hovering at an average of just over 2 percent. 
As costs have increased, student borrowing has expanded to make up the difference. Student loans now comprise about 60 percent of all financial aid, whereas in the 1980-81 school year, loans were just over 40 percent of the total. The average graduate of a four-year college today will have $14,500 in debt upon entering the working world. 
Given the increased reliance on borrowing, it is notable that this reauthorization legislation will provide for a reduction in interest rates on new student loans by approximately 1 percent from current rates. This provision will save students hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars. 
Nearly 84 percent of South Dakota students receive financial aid in some form, with an average annual award of $5,400 to students who receive aid at the six public universities. Approximately 16,000 students in South Dakota receive Pell Grants, accounting for $28 million in federal assistance. 
I am pleased that this bill will provide legislative authority to increase the size of the maximum Pell Grant to $5,000. In the 1970s, Pell Grants covered three-quarters of the costs of attending a four-year public school. Today, these grants cover only one-third of the cost. I realize that finding the budget resources to fund this maximum grant fully will be difficult, but Pell Grants are the most effective program we have for helping low-income students afford post-secondary education. 
This legislation also continues the essential Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program. Although direct lending by the federal government has consumed a portion of the overall student loan volume, all of the colleges and universities in my state of South Dakota continue to use the FFEL program and remain satisfied with the services they receive. Accordingly, I have been skeptical of efforts that might destroy the balance that has existed between direct lending and the FFEL program. Federal policy should not be changed in ways to either favor direct lending or undermine the financial viability of lending by the private sector. 
There are some lesser-noticed provisions of this bill of which I am particularly proud. Promoting the availability and affordability of child care has been one of my highest priorities in the Senate. That's why I am so pleased that legislation I cosponsored earlier this year, the CAMPUS Act, has been incorporated into this bill. CAMPUS stands for Child Care Access Means Parents in School. This provision will establish a grant program to assist colleges with the costs of establishing child care centers to provide campus-based child care for low-income parents attending college. 
The obvious benefit of easy access to child care is that students with young children will have a much greater probability of staying in school and completing their degree. More and more students today are non-traditional students, and the need for campus-based child care is greater than ever before. 
Additionally, this bill establishes an innovative new program to offer student loan forgiveness for those who earn a degree in early childhood education and become full-time child care workers. Child care, unfortunately, is one of the lowest-paying professions that one can find, and this low level of pay is completely incommensurate with the value of those who are caring for young children. Not surprisingly, turnover in this field is very high, as workers find better paying jobs elsewhere. 
It is especially tragic when highly-trained graduates, those who have earned a degree in early childhood education, are forced to leave the child care profession because they can't pay their student loans. We still need to do all we can to raise wages for child care workers, but helping with student loan repayment is a remarkable step forward. This concept was contained in child care legislation I cosponsored last year, and I am very pleased that it has been included in this bill. 
Finally, advocates of a more effective welfare system won a significant victory with the passage of Senator Wellstone's amendment to give states the option of counting two years of post-secondary education as a work requirement for purposes of the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program. I was proud to cosponsor this amendment. 
I have heard from a number of my constituents that current system has had the unfortunate effect of forcing TANF recipients out of college or vocational school and into dead-end, entry-level jobs. It seems obvious that enabling these individuals, which are usually single mothers, to complete a degree would be far more effective in achieving long-term benefits. Education leads to higher income levels, helping move these families out of poverty for good and making them productive taxpayers. Federal requirements should not be so rigid and inflexible that states are prevented exercising this option. I will press to ensure that this amendment survives the upcoming conference. 
Passage of the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 was absolutely essential for the continuation and improvement of a system that helps keep post-secondary education within the reach of typical American families. I am pleased with the Senate's overwhelming vote in favor of this bill, and I look forward to expeditious consideration of the conference report and to sending the bill to President Clinton for his signature.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, and the Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, for their work in helping expedite consideration of this very urgent legislation; also, a special commendation to my colleague, Senator Patty Murray of Washington State, for her extraordinary leadership on this legislation, as well as to Senator Roberts from Kansas. 
Over 10 percent of the world's wheat market is currently boxed out to our country's wheat farmers due to the current economic sanctions. The situation of wheat becomes all the more urgent as we consider sanctions against Pakistan and India, Pakistan being our third largest importer of wheat, at a time when wheat prices have fallen to less than $3 a bushel. 
I have to say, however, that our effort to address this issue today needs to be regarded, I think, as part of a much larger effort to revisit the entire matter of sanctions imposed by the United States, as well as taking a look at other protrade mechanisms available to us. 
In my view, it is inexcusable that the 105th Congress has not moved full funding of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, and fast track continues to languish. I look forward to working with Senator Lugar and others who are looking at comprehensive reform of our entire sanctions regime. 
The fact is, Mr. President, that the United States has slapped economic sanctions on other countries about 120 times in the past 80 years, but over half of those instances have been since the Clinton administration came to power. This month, it is India and Pakistan, but no other country on Earth opts for sanctions as often as has the United States. Currently, our sanctions imposed by our Government affect more than 70 nations in one form or another, home to two-thirds of the world's population. What is worse is that this 105th Congress is considering, as we speak today, an additional 30 sanctions in other pieces of legislation. 
Frankly, it is often an emotional and short-term political calculation which drives these sanctions, rather than a longer term, reasoned, logical explanation of what kind of cost benefit would derive and what kind of diplomatic leverage actually is derived from the sanctions. 
It vents more outrage, but more often than not backfires, particularly in the case of food items, particularly in the case of grain where other nations have an opportunity to grow and to take our markets. 
It is America all too often, rather than the target nations, that becomes isolated and that becomes victims of our own sanctions. When other nations refuse to join with our sanctions, American business suffers. In 1995 alone, unilateral sanctions cost the U.S. economy an estimated $15 billion to $19 billion and up to 260,000 jobs, according to the Institute for International Economics. Sanctions beyond that also give American suppliers a reputation for unreliability and its effects can be long lasting. 
There are instances where sanctions, to some degree, have been effective. South Africa comes to mind. Some aspects or sanctions against Iraq come to mind relative to chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. But the successes we have had with sanctions in the United States, I think, points to a general rule, and that is, to be effective, sanctions must have broad international support and must target specific vulnerabilities. 
We need to be examining more alternatives to sanctions, whether agricultural or otherwise. The engagement with other nations, rather than isolation, is one that I think is coming upon this Congress and certainly this administration as a direction that we need to pursue. 
I am pleased that the Clinton Administration has organized a special State Department team installed to rethink our overall sanctions policy. The premise, I think, of our policy as we move in this direction--first with this bill and then, hopefully, with broader, more far-reaching sanctions legislation--is that it is multilateral sanctions, even if they are weaker in nature, that are usually preferable to unilateral sanctions. And secondly, any sanctions that we do impose should be subject to a cost-benefit analysis. Incredibly, in the past, few sanctions have been evaluated for their consequence on the American economy relative to what it does to the target nations. 
The focus, I believe, needs to be on a much more reasoned approach to sanctions in general. This is a good first step in the right direction. It is urgent because of the Pakistani offer to purchase 350,000 net tons of wheat as of July 15, and we have this urgency now. But I support this legislation, and I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a cosponsor and yield back what time I may have.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in response to the decision by the Supreme Court striking down the Line Item Veto Act. 
Today's decision does not surprise many who have looked closely at the constitutional questions raised by this law. The fundamental flaw of the Line Item Veto Act was that it violated the Presentment Clause of the Constitution by attempting to give the President the power to amend legislation passed by Congress. In the words of Justice Stevens, who wrote for the majority of the Court, `If the Line Item Veto Act were valid, it would authorize the President to create a different law--one whose text was not voted on by either House of Congress or presented to the President for signature.' 
The majority opinion goes on to state that `if there is to be a new procedure in which the President will play a different role in determining the final text' of a law, such change can only result from amending the Constitution. 
Some of my colleagues, in reaction to today's decision, have already announced their support for a constitutional amendment giving the President this power. I hope that, in their haste, they do not overlook a legislative alternative that I am introducing in the Senate today to create a process for expedited consideration of presidentially-proposed rescissions. 
I have been a supporter of line-item rescission legislation since the beginning of my first term in the House of Representatives. I first introduced legislation in August 1987, and I was pleased to see support for this concept grow over the years. 
In November 1987, I wrote to President Reagan's Chief-of-Staff, Howard Baker, to request that line-item rescission be discussed during the Economic Budget Summit that was held during that year. Although the administration declined this request, President Reagan's budget proposal for Fiscal Year 1989 contained a proposal for line-item rescission that was very similar to the legislation that I had introduced. 
Support continued to grow, and a variety of versions of this legislation were introduced in the House. Eventually, the supporters of line-item rescission banded together in 1992 behind a common vehicle, H.R. 2164, which passed the House in October of that year. Insufficient time was available in the legislative year, however, for the Senate to take up the bill. 
After the momentous elections in the fall of 1992, I met with Karen Hancox of President-elect Clinton's transition team. I requested that Clinton support the line-item rescission concept. His endorsement helped win easy House passage of H.R. 1578 on April 29, 1993. To my disappointment, however, the Senate did not take up consideration of this bill, and the 103rd Congress adjourned without progress. 
The 104th Congress brought a change in control of the Congress. With that partisan shift came an inclination to support a new form of line-item rescission, the so-called legislative line-item veto. Unlike line-item rescission, the line-item veto stated that the president's rescissions were to be considered automatically approved unless overridden by a two-thirds vote of both the House and the Senate. Although still a cosponsor of line-item rescission, I voted for the new bill with the knowledge that it would receive constitutional scrutiny by the courts. 
Now that the Supreme Court has ruled, I believe that Congress should take another look at line-item rescission. The bill I submit today, S. 2220, does not cede power to the President to alter an act of Congress. Instead, it provides for an up-or-down vote in Congress of rescissions proposed by the President, thus exposing controversial items of spending to the light of day. If Congress believes the spending is merited, then it will vote to reject the rescission bill. Likewise, if the spending does not stand up to scrutiny, Congress can pass the rescission bill with a majority vote in each house and send it to the President for signature. 
The American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service has conducted a preliminary review of my bill. According to this review, S. 2220 would meet the standard outlined in today's Court decision since the bill would not cede to the President the power to alter the text of legislation passed by Congress. 
It seems clear that we still need a mechanism to highlight items of wasteful spending and to force a vote on this spending. Line-item rescission accomplishes this feat without unduly altering the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches of government. Before running off to amend the Constitution, we should give line-item rescission a try.

Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Chair. 
I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, my friend and colleague, Mr. Reed. I commend him for this particular amendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment. 
If you were to talk to a typical South Dakotan and say, `You know, the Federal budget is tight this year; we may not have the resources we need to do all we would like to do in terms of cancer or heart research at the National Institutes of Health; we may not be able to do all we would like to do for education, for health care; we may not be able to do all that we want for child care; and, oh, by the way, we do have some $1.6 billion of your tax money we are going to turn back to the tobacco industry as a subsidy for their marketing messages to our children,' I guarantee you, the typical South Dakotan would be appalled. He would be amazed that any institution could possibly have come up with a priority as wrong-headed as that. 
And so, Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Reed amendment which would deny tobacco companies any tax deduction for their advertising and promotional expenses 
when those ads are aimed at America's most impressionable group, its children. This amendment has the overwhelming support of the public health community, and it would greatly strengthen the underlying McCain bill. I congratulate my colleague from Rhode Island on this amendment. 
It is almost incomprehensible to me that taxpayers actually subsidize the tobacco industry's promotional efforts even as we go about forming a consensus on the dangers of smoking and the problems created by the industry's efforts to target children. 
Numerous studies have implicated the tobacco industry's advertising and promotional activities as the cause of continued increases in youth smoking rates in recent years. Research on smoking demonstrates that increases in youth smoking directly coincide with effective tobacco promotional campaigns. 
We simply have to address the industry's ceaseless efforts to market to children. It is time for this Congress to put a stop to the industry's practice of luring children into what is an untimely progression of disease and death. 
Under this amendment, if the tobacco manufacturers do not comply with the advertising restrictions as promulgated by the FDA, the manufacturer's ability to deduct the cost of tobacco advertising and promotional expenses will then be disallowed for that particular year. This approach has overwhelming support of the public health community, supported by Dr. C. Everett Koop, the American Lung Association, the Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, and ENACT Coalition, a coalition comprised of leading public health groups including the American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, and many others. 
Mr. President, the importance of this issue is simply enormous. The facts speak for themselves. Today, some 50 million Americans are addicted to tobacco. One of every three long-term users of tobacco will die from a disease related to their tobacco use. About three-quarters, 70 percent, of smokers want to quit, but fewer than one-quarter are successful in doing so. Tobacco addiction is clearly a problem that begins with children. Almost 90 percent of adult smokers started using tobacco at or before the age of 18. The average youth smoker begins at age 13 and becomes a daily smoker by 14 1/2 . 
Each year, 1 million children in our Nation become regular smokers. One-third of them will die prematurely of lung cancer, emphysema, and similar tobacco-caused diseases. Unless current trends are reversed, 5 million kids currently under 18 will die prematurely from tobacco-related disease. 
So, Mr. President, this is a public health crisis. A recent survey by the University of Michigan found that daily smoking among 12th graders increased from 17.2 percent in 1992 to 22.2 percent in 1996 and continued to climb in 1997 to 24.4 percent. This represents a cumulative 43-percent increase in daily smoking among our Nation's high school seniors just over these past 5 years. 
One of the advertising campaigns most markedly aimed at young people is the now notorious Joe Camel campaign that my colleague has alluded to. After R.J. Reynolds introduced this campaign, Camel's market share among underage smokers jumped from 3 percent to over 13 percent in just 3 years. Although Congress had banned cigarette advertising on TV in 1970, tobacco companies routinely circumvented this restriction through sponsorship of sporting events that gave their products exposure through television. 
The Federal Government subsidizes advertising through a tax deduction, generally a 35-percent deduction, for advertising expenses. In 1995, this subsidy cost the American taxpayers approximately $1.6 billion. In terms of lost revenue to the Federal Treasury, this is a very significant sum of money. 
In effect, the Federal Government is subsidizing industry's advertising costs. For example, in 1995 the cost of the cigarette advertising deduction covered the total amount spent by the industry on coupons, multipack promotions, and retail value-added items such as key chains and other point-of-sale advertising, the kind of items that are most attractive to children. 
In 1995, the tobacco industry spent $4.9 billion on advertising, double the total Federal Government appropriation for the National Cancer Institute in fiscal year 1995, $2.1 billion, and almost four times the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute appropriation, which totaled $1.3 billion that year. In 1995, the tobacco industry spent this $4.9 billion on advertising, 40 times the amount spent by the NIH on lung cancer research during that year. 
It is certain that Congress has authority over the Tax Code. We understand the first amendment, free speech rights of any individual, and even in the case of commercial speech. We are very much aware of that. But there is no constitutional right to have the expense of a corporation's speech subsidized by the taxpayers. So, while I concur that within some limits, which the Senator from Rhode Island has outlined relative to commercial speech, there is a first amendment right that is at the heart of all of our concern about advertising, that certainly there is no constitutional right to taxpayer subsidy. When a message is designed to addict vulnerable youth to a deadly product, it is absolutely imperative for Congress to act with great urgency. 
So, again, I commend the Senator from Rhode Island for this amendment, for his excellent outline of the legal history of how we have arrived at where we are today. But it would seem in the course of all the contentious amendments that we have dealt with on this floor over the last several weeks, and will still in the week to come, that this ought to be an amendment around which there would be great bipartisan, commonsense support. I challenge any Member of this body to go home to his or her State and explain to constituents that at the same time we are trying to come up with ways to reduce youth addiction to tobacco products, that we continue to spend in the range of $1.5 billion of the taxpayers' dollars--dollars that could be better used for medical research, for education, that could go back into the pockets of the taxpayers in the form of tax cuts, for that matter. Almost any other use would be more productive than to use it in such a negative way as a subsidy for marketing techniques directed at our youth. 
Again, I commend the Senator from Rhode Island. I commend this amendment to my colleagues and yield my time back to the Senator from Rhode Island.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to talk about the underlying bill and the Kerry amendment that is pending. This is, obviously, the most serious effort ever by any Congress to address the critical public health issue of smoking. 
Now, what has brought us to this point? Obviously, the historic settlement negotiated last year by the States and the tobacco industry provided the most incentive for this, but the tremendous success of several States--and I particularly note the State of Minnesota and their attorney general, Skip Humphrey, in aggressively pursuing their claims against the tobacco industry--has revealed what has been the massive deception that underlies the tobacco industry's traditional position. 
It has been now conclusively demonstrated that tobacco is, in fact, addictive. That is a claim which the tobacco industry had consistently denied and, frankly, covered up. We have learned that the tobacco industry has targeted children to addict them to tobacco products, another claim that the tobacco industry has lied and covered up. We have also learned if you do not start smoking when you are underage, it is unlikely that you will ever become addicted to tobacco. All the more reason, then, all the more incentive, then, for some to try to addict children to this product. 
I support adult choices and adult responsibility, but when an industry targets kids, knowing full well the children are vulnerable to addiction, and then argues for adult choice, it is time for this Congress to step up and protect our kids. 
I don't need to recite the statistics that everyone in this Chamber has heard the past couple of weeks now. Let me just say this: 3,000 children start smoking every day; 1,000 of them will die prematurely due to this addiction. Every day we delay this process, we sentence another 1,000 children in America to die early. 
There are many critical amendments to be reviewed and debated, but let us not lose sight of the fact that we have to act now. There is an urgency to act now. Any further delay would be unconscionable. The lives of our children are at stake, literally. We must protect them from the predatory industry that views youth as `our replacement smokers' good for many decades of addiction to their deadly product. 
Cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed consumer products in our country. Tobacco companies currently spend almost $6 billion a year to promote and advertise products, and they have increased their spending by more than 12 times since 1971, when advertising on radio and television was banned. 
Children are, obviously, the most vulnerable to tobacco company tactics. They have targeted kids because of this vulnerability to nicotine addiction, and they are the most easily affected by slick advertising and promotional ploys. The evidence is overwhelming that smoking is a pediatric disease. I support a comprehensive approach to ensure success in our efforts to protect kids. For every 10 cents added to the price of cigarettes, approximately 700,000 fewer teens will begin smoking. 
To further promote public health, I have supported investment in public health and research. We must maintain and support FDA authority to restrict advertising directed at teens. Finally, we have to strengthen the look-back provisions and, ultimately, hold tobacco companies responsible for their efforts to addict kids. These important decisions will influence companies to stop marketing to children with advertising and promotional techniques. 
I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have supported our efforts to address this critically important issue. 
My own State of South Dakota holds the dubious distinction of having the second-highest rate of underage tobacco use in America. Now, I am committed to doing what I can to see these rates reduced. 
Almost one out of every nine high school boys in my State will die prematurely from tobacco use. Of the teenagers in our State, we can now expect 15,000 South Dakota teenagers to die early because of their tobacco use. These odds are way too high to be permitted or to be tolerated by this body. The expeditious passage of this tobacco bill will have a real and immediate impact on releasing those rates. We cannot delay any longer. I am also pleased that as we debate this issue, Senator Kerry, Senator Bond, and others, have joined in an effort, which I have joined in as well, to direct a modest portion of the revenue generated for child care purposes. 
I appreciate that there has been a significant debate on the floor of this body on the use of revenue generated by this legislation. I think it is correct that this legislation ought to be directed at cessation of smoking and tobacco use and not as a revenue generator. However, the reality is that any realistic bill that has a chance of reducing tobacco usage will generate revenue, and this body has a responsibility of determining how best, then, to use that amount of revenue generated--some $62 billion over the first 5 years. 
It makes sense to me the first emphasis ought to be on health care, reimbursing the States, clearly, for the health care expenses they have incurred. It makes sense to me that there ought to be a high emphasis on medical research, on cancer, lung cancer, heart disease, and other diseases that are smoking-related. There ought to be a huge effort in that direction. There ought to be an effort and a priority for smoking cessation programs. But it also seems to me that some of these dollars ought to roll back to families and to children through some tax relief. No doubt, that will be a part of the package. But I think it is a mistake to include a tax package that is so enormous that it drains, overall, the revenue, or a large share of the revenue that could otherwise have been utilized for medical research, help for the States, smoking cessation, or for child care. I think there needs to be a balance in that regard. 
I am particularly troubled by the amendment that was passed yesterday, which would, in fact, not only drain these resources away, but would ultimately dip into the budget surpluses and, in fact, Social Security surpluses to make good on its obligation. But I believe that if we can use the revenue that Senators Kerry and Dodd have proposed, it would go a long way toward promoting at least a portion of the goals of our Early Childhood Development Act, which I have cosponsored with them. 
This amendment, if adopted, would go a significant way toward assisting working families, recognizing the reality that more and more families now have both parents in the workforce, and in the case of single-parent families, quality child care is all the more essential. Each day, an estimated 13 million children younger than 6 years old, including 6 million toddlers, spend all or part of their day in child care of some form, and child care experts tell us it easily costs between $4,000 and $10,000 a year for a child. 
Now, augmenting the block grants to the States where we do not create a Federal bureaucracy, we do not federalize child care, we do not run things from Washington, but we give the resources necessary for States to devise their own innovative, strong child care strategies, makes all the sense in the world, particularly given the fact that, as I have held child care meetings all around the State of South Dakota, it has become 
obvious to me that not only do people have too few choices--quality choices--but all too often the child care providers themselves find themselves on the economic edge, with good people leaving that particular profession because of the low salaries and the high stress of that particular occupation. So we have children at the most vulnerable point in their lives, where the greatest share of brain development is taking place in the course of their lives, with a patchwork system that has simply not received the national attention it deserves. This amendment would go a long way toward augmenting the child care options, the affordable quality options that working parents in our country deserve to have. 
I appreciate that there are people in this body and around the country on the far political right who seem to lie awake nights worrying that somehow this legislation may generate the resources essential for the Government to actually do something for kids. I don't lie awake nights worrying about that. I worry about how can we work on a partnership basis with States, local governments, and private organizations to provide more affordable and quality options for child care and improve the health of the next generation of Americans. I think that is the underlying concern. For that reason, I am very supportive of this amendment and the underlying bill. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I returned Wednesday night from my second tour of what is left of the small community of Spencer, SD, which was devastated, as many know, by a tornado this past Saturday night. Many of you may have seen the media reports and the pictures of the utter destruction in Spencer. 
After touring the site for the second time on Wednesday, I can honestly say the pictures simply do not do the site justice, and it is almost impossible to fathom the indiscriminate totality of the destruction. 
This tornado, which hit this small town, has been classified as an F4 on the Fujita rating scale of the National Weather Service. The rating means winds have been estimated between 207 to 260 miles an hour. 
As I toured the remains of this small town, the wind literally blew the bark off the trees--what trees still remained standing. 
To the community of Spencer, the rating means that the tornado was powerful enough to destroy 80 to 90 percent of their town. 
The grain elevator, service station, post office, and library were all destroyed, as were all four churches, an antique store, the fire hall, and water tower. The town had no sewer, water or power. 
All that is left of Spencer's 120-foot tall water tower is the crumpled metal on the side of the street with the word `Spencer' written upside down now. A tan car hung suspended 5 feet off the ground in the tower's mangled legs. 
The grain spilled from the Spencer Grain Company elevator out onto a field. Spiky tops of tree trunks stuck up out of the ground, their branches stripped of leaves--and furniture, bedding, miscellaneous items stuck in the tree tops of what trees did remain. 
Most tragically, the tornado was powerful enough to injure, out of the 300-some in the community, 150 people--almost half the population--and to take the lives of 6. 
The victims were Bev Bintliff, Elizabeth Burnham, Mildred Pugh, Gloria Satterlee, Ron Selken, and Irene Yost. 
Bev Bintliff was 68, a Spencer native. She and her husband, Robert, moved back to Spencer after living in Oklahoma for a number of years. She worked for several local businesses before becoming the city's finance officer. Her husband is a painter. And they also operated a music shop in the nearby community of Mitchell. 
Elizabeth Burnham was 85, lived in Spencer most of her life. She was a widow, and lived alone in her home. She is survived by two daughters. 
Mildred Pugh, 93, a widow, moved from her home of 60 years in Spencer to an apartment in the mid-1980s. She was born on the family homestead northeast of Spencer and lived in the area all of her life. Her husband was a rural mail carrier, and she was a homemaker. Friends say that she loved her garden and she loved to deer hunt with her husband. Mildred had lived through other disasters. She survived floods, cyclones, famine, the Depression, wars, but could not survive this tornado. She is survived by a great-nephew, a grandson, and two granddaughters, and a sister. 
Ron D. Selken, 62, has been described as a quiet man who enjoyed spending time with his family. Selken was born in 1936. He attended Hawthorne Elementary in Sioux Falls. He served in the Korean War. He worked as a laborer at Gage Bros. Concrete in Sioux Falls until becoming disabled because of back problems. In his spare time, Selken liked to work on his cars, watch sports and fish. 
He recently became a grandfather for the third time and tragically did not get to hold his new granddaughter who was born May 2. On my first trip to the tornado site last Sunday, I met Ron's daughter, Kris Roelfs, of Sibley, Iowa. I have to say, it was a very touching meeting and I felt inadequate that I could only give her my heartfelt condolences. Her father had moved to Spencer about eight years ago from Sioux Falls. In addition to his daughter, Kris, Ron Selken is survived by another daughter, Vicky Selken of Sioux Falls, a son, Kelley of Lake Benton, MN. Three grandchildren, two brothers and four sisters. 
Gloria Satterlee, was in her mid 70's and was an organist and pianist at the Nazarene Church where her husband, Ward Sr. has been pastor for the tiny congregation. Reverend Ward Satterlee was hospitalized at Queen of Peace Hospital in Mitchell with broken ribs and cuts but on my second visit to the tornado site yesterday, I had the chance to speak briefly with Ward as he explained his predicament to Vice President Gore. 
The Satterlees celebrated their 50th anniversary last year and had lived in Spencer for more than 20 years. Mrs. Satterlee was a homemaker who was interested in music and caring for elderly people. In addition to her husband she is survived by two children one in Kansas and one in northern Minnesota. 
Irene Yost, in her mid 70's was retired and living in a downtown apartment complex in Spencer. She had been ailing and had just been getting back on her feet when it happened. She was a lifelong resident of Spencer, and once owned a business establishment in the community, worked as a telephone operator and in a Salem factory and operated a Bingo Gas Station for a number of years. 
While we mourn the tragic loss of these people and pray for their families, we are grateful for those who survived. Many descriptions of the terror the residents felt last Saturday night and of different individual's determination 
to survive have been shared with me personally over the past few days or have been shared with the public through the news media. 
Linda Morehead's first thought was, `Oh God don't let it be a tornado.' As the tornado hit, Linda tried to open her basement door, but it stuck. She finally got it open and made it down one step when the wall between her dining room and the staircase fell and her roof blew off. She said that the roof flew off like a frisbee then it was all over and that she was down in a pit with stuff all around me like a hill. 
Linda was trapped in her home after the storm because her left leg became pinned under cement and a radiator. Her leg was broken in two places and a chunk of flesh was ripped off when the cement was removed by rescue workers. Morehead's arms and shoulders were covered with bruises and cuts, but her face was untouched. As rain and marble-sized hail began to fall while she was trapped she covered her face with a nearby pair of sweatpants. In spite of the pain she continues to suffer and the long road ahead to recovery, Linda recognizes her good fortune to have survived and remembers moments when she didn't think she was going to live through it. 
Linda has mixed emotions as she said `I am angry because everything you own is gone. Everything Mom and Dad worked for all their life is gone. I get so angry. And then I'm thankful the kids are all right. 
Late Sunday afternoon Linda was still finding debris in her hair--rocks, pine needles, glass, wood splinters. 
Tammy Kreutzfeldt remembers that she and her family all screamed as the pressure built and the roof of their house blew off. She and her family looked up and could see the tornado and the sky from their basement. Tammy had cuts on her head inflicted from falling bricks as she huddled with friends and family members in the basement of her home during the tornado. 
Lucille and Jimmy Mone, 89 and 95 years old respectively, crawled over glass to safety. Jimmy who had been blown right out of bed crawled with Lucille on their hands and knees through shards of glass from blown out windows and broken pictures to their downstairs where they stayed until the storm had passed. Again, these two amazingly strong fighters recognized their good fortune as they looked back on their minutes of terror and acknowledged that, `We're still alive and that's the important thing.' 
Arnold Eldeen was driving Saturday night when he spotted the tornado that demolished much of his hometown. He raced home and arrived about 15 minutes after the tornado hit. While Arnold had been able to call his two sons before the tornado hit Spencer, it took almost three hours for him to find them to ensure they were both alive--thankfully, his sons had been able to make it out of Spencer before the tornado ravaged the community. 
Amanda Stevens, 85, was in a corner of her basement when the tornado struck and she prayed that she would not be pulled out of her basement. The tornado ripped the roof off her home, but miraculously the ceramic tile remained in place which she tediously laid on the walls 27 years ago as she and her now-deceased husband built their home. 
On Sunday, South Dakota's Governor William Janklow acted expeditiously to request a disaster declaration for the Spencer area from President Clinton. I was extremely pleased that the President acted swiftly and responded positively on Monday with a declaration for McCook County. While the declaration opens up a lot of assistance to help the victims start rebuilding their lives, the assistance certainly won't make anyone whole. 
I was also pleased that on Monday, Vice President Gore and FEMA Director James Lee Witt both announced they would tour the tornado ravaged area. I was pleased to join them on their tour Wednesday. I truly believe their visit helped lift the spirits of many of the victims. 
South Dakota has been hit by many devastating acts of Mother Nature in recent years. While the natural disasters South Dakota has faced in the recent past have all been different, two things are consistent in the wake of every disaster my state has experienced: 
First, the victims of the disaster always have a positive spirit and are determined to survive and rebuild their lives. Having met with residents of Spencer twice in the past 6 days, I have been moved by their resilence and their ability to remain focused on the future, after an act of Mother Nature wiped away the town they called home and a lifetime of personal possessions in a matter of minutes. The victims have shown a quiet determination to rebuild their lives and I commend them for their attitude. It can't be easy and I am committed to doing what I can to help each and every resident of Spencer move forward with their lives. 
I am always impressed and heartened by the selfless giving of concerned individuals coming to the aid of their fellow South Dakotans. South Dakotans have made it through tough times before and I think South Dakotans rush to reach out to our neighbors in need because we all realize that the next disaster could hit us. 
The response was tremendous. The tornado hit Spencer at approximately 8:45 pm on Saturday night. By 10 pm 300 emergency rescue workers and medical personnel were on the scene. 
Volunteers came from almost every city in the region to assist and help ease the shock from Kimball to Stickney to Dell Rapids. As a stream of ambulances entered city limits packed with volunteers, water, and blankets, other ambulances screamed out, loaded with wounded en route to hospitals in Mitchell and Sioux Falls. 
Members of the National Guard and the State Highway Patrol were also on the scene immediately to assist victims. 
While almost all families had their homes destroyed, very few victims have had to seek shelter provided by the Red Cross of FEMA because family and friends in the area have opened their homes to the victims. 
Within a day of the devastating tornado in Spencer, businesses and individuals from across South Dakota provided tornado victims with financial and moral support to help them rebuild their lives. I have been extremely touched--though I must say not surprised--by the many examples of generosity and compassion exhibited by individuals all over our state. 
The community is working together to assist victims, including collecting items needed by tornado victims. The Chapter of the American Red Cross has set up a fund. The United Methodist Church in Huron will give their entire offering of the next weekend to assist the victims. A television telethon raised over $500,000 in a matter of hours. Some 8,000 volunteers--more, frankly, than could be efficiently utilized--showed up at the Spencer city limits to volunteer. Many other communities around the State have set up funds for the disaster victims. The South Dakota Community Foundation, which grants money to worthy causes, announced it will give $1,000 to every Spencer resident. 
Two nights ago, KELO TV conducted an impromptu telethon to collect funds for the victims. The effort collected over $500,000 in a matter of hours. 
Perhaps most impressive, in response to a request by Governor Janklow for volunteers to come to Spencer yesterday morning, again an estimated 8,000 people showed up to volunteer in this small town. Governor Janklow originally asked for 1,000 volunteers. 
The leaders of Spencer, South Dakota have continued their commitment and loyalty to their community all throughout the disaster. Mayor Rocky Kirby, owner of the destroyed grain elevator, has spent day and night dealing with not only his own personal loss of his business but working with Governor Janklow and FEMA officials to get their town back together. 
City Council member Donna Ruden stayed up the entire first night putting together a map of the community with the names and locations of all citizens to assist Governor Janklow, the National Guard, and the cleanup crews. As an employee of the Security State Bank, which was also destroyed with only the vault left standing, opened her home immediately as a make-shift bank, a meeting place for citizens and their insurance companies and a place to stop and share their accounts of the storm. She placed a sign on her front door, `please come in'. 
The Red Cross and Salvation Army have done a remarkable job and I would be remiss if I did not recognize these people. 
In closing, Mr. President, I just want to again commend the victims for their resilience and positive spirit in the wake of this tragedy. I also want to assure them that in the coming weeks as the tv cameras and media leave and they are left to the day-to-day effort of rebuilding their lives, I will not forget about them. I am committed to working with individuals and with the different federal agencies offering assistance to ensure aid comes when people need it and with as few bureaucratic strings attached as possible. 
Again, my thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who lost their lives in this tragedy and my best wishes to all of the survivors during the next few critically important weeks as they take steps to rebuild their lives.  
Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues I am deeply concerned about the recent nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan. The leaders of these two nations acted with disregard and both countries must be shown that such actions are unacceptable. No nation should think that it can conduct secret nuclear tests and not be held accountable. The United States and the international community will continue to impose sanctions on both countries, causing further economic hardship for these impoverished populations. However, I believe we can do much more to prevent further testing.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as we begin our second week of debate on the tobacco settlement legislation introduced by Senator McCain, we are faced with a cloture vote on H.R. 1270, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. As we all know, the issues surrounding nuclear waste storage are extremely complex, often contentious, and no simple solutions exist. While I do not agree with everything in the bill, I have supported legislative action on this critical issue in the past and hope to in the future. This country cannot afford inaction on this issue, and it is my hope that we will soon move to address this vital issue. 
That being said, I oppose the effort to invoke cloture on H.R. 1270 today. We concluded one week of debate on a national tobacco settlement prior to the Memorial Day recess. That legislation, which is absolutely critical to public health, and especially children's health, remains the pending business before the Senate, and I cannot support any effort to substitute other legislation before this body at this time. 
We all know the vital statistics surrounding underage tobacco use. Every day, 3,000 children will start smoking. One thousand of them will die prematurely from this addiction. It is time to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation that addresses the critical public health issues caused by tobacco use. Such an approach will reduce teen smoking, invest in public health research and programs to help smokers quit, and protect tobacco farmers and their communities. 
Let us keep in mind that the tobacco industry has carefully targeted children. They have done this because children are most vulnerable to nicotine addiction and they are most easily affected by slick advertising and promotional ploys. The evidence is overwhelming that smoking is a pediatric disease. Almost ninety percent of all people who ever try a cigarette, do so by age 18, and 71 percent of people who have ever smoked daily were smoking by age 18. 
My own state of South Dakota ranks second among all states in underage tobacco use. Almost 40 percent of our high school kids smoke cigarettes, and even more use smokeless tobacco. Almost a quarter of all expectant mothers in South Dakota report using tobacco during pregnancy; an appalling statistic that results in low birth weight and other natal difficulties. 
Mr. President, we face an historic opportunity to address a critical public health problem. I firmly believe that this legislation will be remembered as a dramatic change in our government's efforts and policies. This bill will be one of the most socially significant items this Congress tackles. Therefore, I will oppose cloture on H.R. 1270 at this time. The Senate should maintain focus on tobacco legislation that will help our children withstand the pressures and inducements of the tobacco industry to addict them to tobacco products. 
I must also express my frustration over a recent statement from the Speaker of the House. He has apparently determined that the nuclear waste conference report will not be considered by the House of Representatives. If that is the case, any further action on the Senate floor is obviously for partisan political purposes, and I will not support furthering that goal.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a very special South Dakotan--Mary Mooney-Keith. 
On July 1, 1998, Mary Mooney-Keith, of Rapid City, South Dakota will retire after many years of diligent service for the school children of South Dakota. Mary is retiring to a lifestyle where hopefully someone can serve her just like all the years she served children through her wonderful food service career. 
Mary's outstanding food service career allowed her to demonstrate her knowledge, leadership, and passion for nutrition at all levels. From her work at the small school district of Faith, South Dakota to her service at Meade, South Dakota (one of the largest geographical districts in the nation), to her role at the South Dakota Child and Adult Nutrition Services, Mary always strived to make it her goal to make the school nutrition program the best possible. 
Mary's nutrition expertise did not stop in the classroom. She also was very active in the School Food Service Association at the local, state, and national levels. She held elected offices at all levels within the Association--including Midwest Regional Director. 
Mary's passion for child nutrition came through in her teaching style. She wasn't the teacher who went in and just talked to her students. Instead, she went to a clown school in Wisconsin during the summers and developed Mario the Clown' to assist with her instruction. 
Mary is the type of person whose career may not have made her famous or wealthy. But, for 32 years, Mary Mooney-Keith taught our most precious citizens, our school children, one of the most important lessons in life--good nutrition. And, the greatest thing about it all, she lived her life with one basic principle that sometimes we all forget, to simply be yourself.' 
I am proud of Mary Mooney-Keith and offer her my best wishes in her upcoming retirement.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce legislation to authorize a critically important rural water system in South Dakota, the `Perkins County Rural Water System Act of 1998.' I am pleased to have my good friend and colleague from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, as an original cosponsor of this important legislation, which I had introduced during the 104th Congress as a Member of the House of Representatives. Congressman Thune of South Dakota is the sponsor of similar legislation in the House during this Congress. This legislation is also strongly supported by the State of South Dakota and local project sponsors, who have demonstrated that support by agreeing to substantial financial contributions from the local level. 
Like many parts of South Dakota, Perkins County has insufficient water supplies of reasonable quality available, and the water supplies that are available do not meet the minimum health and safety standards, thereby posing a threat to public health and safety. 
In addition to improving the health of residents in the region, I strongly believe that this rural drinking water delivery project will help to stabilize the rural economy as well. Water is a basic commodity and is essential if we are to foster rural development in many parts of rural South Dakota, including the Perkins County area. 
The `Perkins County Rural Water System Act of 1998' authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to construct a Perkins County Rural Water System providing service to approximately 2,500 people, including the communities of Lemmon and Bison, as well as rural residents. The Perkins County Rural Water System is located in northwestern South Dakota along the South Dakota/North Dakota border and it will be an extension of an existing rural water system in North Dakota, the Southwest Pipeline Project. The State of South Dakota has worked closely with the State of North Dakota over the years on the Perkins County connection to the Southwest Pipeline Project. A feasibility study completed in 1994 looked at several alternatives for a dependable water supply, and the connection to the Southwest Pipeline Project is clearly the most feasible for the Perkins County area. 
Mr. President, South Dakota is plagued by water of exceedingly poor quality, and the Perkins County rural water project is an effort to help provide clean water--a commodity most of us take for granted--to the people of Perkins County, South Dakota. I am a strong believer in the federal governments role in rural water delivery, and I hope to continue to advance that agenda both in South Dakota and around the country. I urge my colleagues to support this important rural water legislation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to move forward on enactment as quickly as possible.

The Tulare band will travel to Winkler, Manitoba, Canada on June 2, 1998 to perform concerts with the Canadian Garden Valley Collegiate School. 
I want to express my appreciation to Paul Moen, band director and Karl Redekop, principal from Garden Valley Collegiate School. These two individuals have worked very hard to plan and organize this exciting trip. I also want to thank Tulare's band director, Sam Glantzow, for his countless hours of dedicated work to see that this great learning experience for the band members from Tulare High School is a success. 
Mr. President, the band members from both schools will gain valuable knowledge about new cultures and will form international friendships. I am sure this will be an experience everyone will remember for a lifetime.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned that India conducted three underground nuclear tests in the western desert state of Rajasthan on Monday, May 11, and two additional tests at the same site on Wednesday, May 13. These tests were conducted without any advance warning to the rest of the world and are a dangerous precedent for future testing by other nations. No nation should think that it can conduct secret nuclear tests and not be held accountable for its actions. Furthermore, these tests run counter to an international campaign to pass the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), of which I fully support, and are both irresponsible and unacceptable. The United States and the international community must speak out against this action and act swiftly and justly. 
India, which has not signed the 1970 nonproliferation treaty, gave no advance warning about the nuclear tests on Monday and Wednesday. Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said that the explosions in the desert, 330 miles southwest of New Delhi, did not result in the release of radiation into the atmosphere. However, this is simply untrue. Nuclear explosions, even when they are conducted underground, release deadly radioactive materials into the atmosphere and water table, posing health risks for generations to come. Treating the human race and the environment with such complete disrespect is unacceptable and will not go unnoticed. 
While many of India's leaders have applauded these tests, the people of India are hurt the most. India is a country of extreme poverty and all Indians will be harmed by this act. On one hand, international sanctions are imminent which will pose further economic hardship on the poorest of the poor. On the other, the radiation from these nuclear blasts has severe health impacts on all Indians including those closest to New Delhi. It was irresponsible for the leaders of India to sacrifice the economic and physical well-being of its people for a display of military might. 
Moreover, countries that break international law by detonating nuclear devices are subject to denial of U.S. credits and credit guarantees. 
Federal law also requires U.S. opposition to loan requests to international lending institutions and bars loans from any U.S. bank to the Indian government except those that provide food or other agricultural commodities. I will bring the issue of international sanctions and international lending up with my colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee, which overseas World Bank issues, to ensure that appropriate actions are taken with regard to countries who disregard international law and conduct nuclear tests. 
India, one of several nations widely suspected of nuclear capability which has not joined the 1970 CTBT treaty, now observed by 185 countries, should be pressured to sign the treaty immediately. India's leaders acted with disregard and India must be shown that its actions are unacceptable. The United States will be forced to impose sanctions on India, and I would urge swift action on this front. Nevertheless, this irresponsible act by India should not be an impetus to step up the arms race by Pakistan. Instead, Pakistan should exercise restraint and caution while the international community imposes sanctions. In the long-term, Pakistan will benefit most by responding to this action, not with military buildup, but with a higher level of dignity and morality. 
Mohandas Gandhi said, We must support friends even in their mistakes, however, it must be the friend and not the mistake we are supporting.' India's decision to conduct nuclear tests was a mistake that was both irresponsible and unacceptable. Although I wish no ill on the people of India, the leaders of the country must accept responsibility for this mistake and the consequences that, no doubt, will follow.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act. This bill seeks to prevent states from protecting their own citizens from unscrupulous actions by a small minority in the securities industry. We must allow states to protect their own investors, and this further intrusion into states rights is unwarranted by the evidence. 
Preempting state remedies now--and requiring fraud victims to seek relief solely under the federal standards promulgated in 1995--could leave investors with severely limited ability to protect themselves against fraud. We should permit the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act to be interpreted by the courts before we embark on this effort to anticipate future problems with the PSLRA that have not yet arisen. Several federal district courts have issued rulings on the 1995 law that are so restrictive that they threaten almost all private enforcement of securities law--including holding that reckless wrongdoers are no longer liable to their victims under the PSLRA. 
The SEC has warned in briefs filed in these cases that such a result would essentially end private enforcement of the federal securities laws. By eliminating state remedies for fraud before knowing whether the courts will finally interpret the PSLRA in a way that provides victims with a viable means to recover their losses, S. 1260 risks not only harming innocent investors but undermining public confidence in our securities markets. 
There is no need for any federal action inasmuch as there have been few state securities class actions filed since the PSLRA passed, and most have been in one state. Preemption proponents cite an imaginary `explosion' of state suits filed to `circumvent' the PSLRA in the two years since its enactment. But the mere handful of state securities class actions filed in 1997--only 44 nationwide--represents a one-third decrease since 1996 and is less than in the three years before the PSLRA was passed. It also is an infinitesimally small percentage of the roughly 15 million civil cases filed in state courts each year. No state other than California has had more than seven securities class actions filed in the two years since enactment of the PSLRA. Given these small numbers, there is no reason why states should not be left free to decide how best to protect their own citizens from fraud. 
State laws against securities fraud are part of a dual enforcement system that has served the country exceptionally well since the Depression. States enacted protections against financial schemes in the early 1900s. Congress passed federal securities laws in 1933 and 1934 to complement--not replace--state laws and to stop abuses that caused the 1929 crash. Many states have chosen to provide more expansive investor protections than federal law currently provides--through accountability for aiders and abettors, realistic time limits for filing a fraud claim, and the ability to recover fully from professionals who help perpetrate frauds (like lawyers and accountants) when the main wrongdoer is bankrupt, in jail, or has fled the country. For example, according to the SEC, 49 of the 50 states provide liability for aiders and abettors now unavailable under federal law and 33 states provide longer statutes of limitations for securities fraud actions than current federal law. S. 1260 would take away these important state remedies. 
This effort has been underway virtually since the PSLRA passed. It is not based on the new realities created by the PSLRA, but rather to eliminate another form of protection for investors. The SEC has repeatedly expressed concern that federal legislation to preempt state laws is premature. In an April 1997 letter to the President forwarding a lengthy SEC report on the operation of the PSLRA, Chairman Arthur Levitt stated, `The Commission endorses the ultimate conclusion of this report: it is too early to assess with great confidence many important effects of the [PSLRA] and therefore, on this basis, it is premature to propose legislative changes. . . The one-year time frame has not allowed for sufficient practical experience with the Reform Act's provisions, or for many court decisions (particularly appellate court decisions) interpreting those provisions.' The SEC reiterated this view in October 1997 testimony before both the House and Senate and has specifically criticized the pending preemption legislation, stating that it `would deprive investors of important protections.' SEC Commissioner Norman Johnson, a Republican, has been especially critical: `Given the possible adverse affect on investor confidence, as well as the long history of effective and concurrent federal and state securities regulation, and the strong federalism concerns raised by preemption . . . extreme caution should be exercised before state courthouse doors are closed to small investors through the preclusion of state class actions for securities fraud.' While three of the five SEC Commissioners no longer oppose S. 1260, there has been no change in any of the underlying facts that led to the SEC's earlier report and testimony. Commissioner Johnson continues to oppose S. 1260. 
With more and more Americans participating in the stock market boom, it is more imperative that we maintain these investor protections, not weaken them. According to a front-page article in the November 30, 1997, New York Times, `Investment Fraud Is Soaring Along with the Stock Market.' This was only one in a long line of recent articles reporting on widespread fraud in the financial markets--a fact acknowledged by federal and state enforcement officials nationwide. The National White Collar Crime Center reports that corporate financial crime costs $565 billion annually, nearly 12 times the amount of street crime. The New York Attorney General has reported that investor complaints have risen 40% per year in the past two years; the U.S. Attorney in New York City has stated that she has witnessed an `explosion' of securities fraud; and the mob has now infiltrated Wall Street. Yet, federal and state enforcement resources are shrinking. As SEC Chairman Levitt observed in December 1997: `In a market like this, parasites crowd in to feast on the bull's success.' In light of all this, Congress should strengthen, not weaken, existing deterrents. 
This premption of state law is opposed by a broad coalition, including the American Association of Retired Persons; American Federation of State County and Municipal Workers; Consumer Federation of America; Consumers Union; Gray Panthers; Government Finance Officers Association; Municipal Treasurers' Association; National League of Cities; National Association of Counties; National Association of County Treasurers and Finance Officers and many, many others. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this unnecessary and unwarranted federal intrusion into what should appropriately be state law.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the importance of passing the Conference Report on the Agricultural Research Bill, S. 1150. 
This bill has the overwhelming support of over 70 Senators, yet we have continued to struggle here in the Senate to get this critically important legislation passed. 
In recent years, American agriculture has greatly changed. Because of the 1996 Farm Bill, our producers rely greatly on the crop insurance program to protect them from production risk. The reforms in agricultural research programs included in S. 1150 provide a roadmap for the future of agriculture. As importantly, it includes a funding stream to fund important new investments in agricultural research and rural development by creating and funding The Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems and by extending the Fund for Rural America. 
And yes, to the chagrin of some, this legislation reinstates food stamp benefits for our most vulnerable legal immigrants. I would hasten to point out that these provisions are modeled on sections of last year's Balanced Budget Act that restored eligibility for Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid to some legal immigrants. 
I applaud the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and Senator Harkin for their leadership in crafting the balanced compromise inherent in this legislation. Attempts to derail this compromise put at risk the important investments in agriculture and the sound research and crop insurance reforms included in the bill. 
Living in a state like South Dakota, I know first hand, and as most of you saw during last year's disaster, what continual flooding can do to our precious farm land. Again, this year, eight counties in northeastern South Dakota are again experiencing severe flooding conditions. 
Without a strong safety net, crop insurance remains as the only safety net for producers to protect them from the vagaries of nature. This bill provides nearly $500 million for partial funding for this important risk management tool. 
I have been informed by several crop insurance agents in South Dakota that the Agricultural Research Bill must be passed soon or many producers face the possible cancellation of their policies. Keep in mind, these policies, are in many cases, the only protection producers have from disasters which are not of their acts of mismanagement but as acts of nature. 
The bill covers all facets of federally funded agricultural research, including: the Agriculture Research Service of USDA; the Cooperative Extension Service; Land Grant Universities such as South Dakota State University and competitive research and extension programs open to other entities.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York and the Senator from California for their extraordinary work on this important legislation. 
Mr. President, frankly, I have to share a great level of frustration, and to be candid, anger at where we find ourselves this morning: unable to move forward with the breast cancer legislation for which there is broad bipartisan support and little controversy. I have more than simply a public policy concern about this issue. I have a personal concern in my own family, having gone through my wife's breast cancer challenge over the past 2 years. She is doing very well. But we had a situation where she remained in the hospital for one night following surgery. She went home with the drains, and the other complications. We were able to do that all right because we don't have small children at home. We had no complications. But I know of other women in my State of South Dakota who have small children at home who cannot take a great amount of time from work, who have no extra help, who have extra complications, and who have all sorts of matters that are debilitating that cause complications. And 24 hours for many of them is simply not adequate. We have an opportunity here to correct that problem. This doesn't correct everything. 
I share the support of the Senator from California for the Patients' Bill of Rights. I am frustrated, as well, that we haven't made greater progress there. I hope that before this session is over we will in fact deal with the more comprehensive health care reform legislation. 
I applaud Senator Daschle's leadership on the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation. But I do not want to make the perfect the enemy of the good. What we have here is a piece of legislation which we should be able to pass this very day. 
It is certainly my hope, while we have the continued discussion about a more comprehensive approach to managed care and ensuring the rights of all patients, that before this session of the 105th Congress expires--and we are running out of time quickly--that, in fact, we get this breast cancer bill to the floor and deal with it in an expeditious fashion. 
Again, I simply want to applaud the leadership of the Senators from California and New York on this issue, one that we really should not allow to be delayed longer than it already has. 
I yield my time.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I share the widespread support for this important legislation. This bill would consolidate and reauthorize job training and vocational education programs. This bill enables states to create a unified plan for all social services related to job training and vocational and adult education. 
Job training and vocational education are vital programs which prepare individuals to compete in today's changing global economy. An estimated 346,000 high-tech jobs are going unfilled nationwide. The increasing shortage of highly trained workers threatens our nation's economic growth and our productivity. This measure will help address these short-comings and prepare more of America's workers, and thus America's businesses, for the Twenty-first century. 
We live in a capitalist society with a free market economy. Employers seek to hire the best qualified job candidates. S. 1186 simply provides a means to help individuals acquire the skills necessary to compete. The acquisition of these skills will best help individuals thrive as our economy continues to grow. Too many of our citizens have been left behind the growing economy of the past years, and this measure will help them keep up with the new economy. 
I believe that S. 1186 also supports our commitment to move individuals from welfare to work. Job training prepares individuals to compete in the marketplace, and remain free from government assistance. For all of the foregoing reasons, I support this bill. 
One important part of this legislation is the reauthorization of the programs under the Carl D. Perkins Vocation and Applied Technology Education Act. I have heard from constituents across my state that these programs are a very critical component of our vocational and technical education system. 
As we in the Congress work to help our nation prepare for the Twenty-first century, there are few challenges more fundamental to our success than ensuring that our work force has the education and training necessary to compete in the global economy. More and more jobs require technical skills, training that is not offered in our traditional four-year colleges. Our vocational and technical schools, accordingly, are absolutely essential for the students and workers of today. Technical skills lead to higher wages for workers and more competitive businesses. That is why the federal-state-local partnership for vocational and technical education, which has been very successful to date, must be continued. 
The highest priority for the moment is to get the reauthorization of the Perkins Act programs through the Senate and into conference. The legislative session this year is very short, and we cannot afford to delay passage of this bill any further. That said, however, there are a number of provisions of this bill which need improvement. 
Foremost among the needed changes, in my view, is that the Senate should accept what the House has proposed in terms of a separate bill for vocational-technical education. This difference is very crucial, for it is essential to preserve the independent mission and funding stream for vocational education. 
For some time, it appeared that the Senate bill was headed in the wrong direction, removing the separate designation for vocational and technical education and placing these programs into the mix of the overhaul of our job training and retraining programs. That would have been a serious mistake, and I am pleased with the improvements that the managers of this bill have agreed to offer to this legislation. 
Among the expected changes is an assurance that funding appropriated for vocational-technical education programs will be directed to school-based programs and not diverted to other areas. Additionally, the amendment is expected to ensure that governance for vocational education will remain at the state and local level, and that a strong focus will remain on professional development for teachers and administrators. 
The House, on the other hand, has proposed a separate legislative authorization for the Perkins Act programs. Despite the forthcoming changes to the Senate bill, I urge the Senate conferees to accept the position of the House with respect to reauthorization. 
Today, however, I believe that we should send this bill to the conference committee, where I hope that the remaining issues can be resolved, and I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill as expeditiously as possible.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member, Senator Moynihan of New York, and the chairman, Senator Roth of Delaware, for their excellent work on this legislation and for bringing this to the floor. 
I rise today to express my qualified support for this legislation that is long overdue, the IRS Reform and Restructuring Act. When I say `qualified,' that qualification is primarily over the question of paying for this legislation in full. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, it is a matter of great importance to me. I am very heartened that Chairman Roth has expressed very clearly on the floor here today that there will, in fact, be offsets sufficient to pay for this legislation not only during the first 5 years but the remaining 5 years as well. I look forward to reviewing those offsets, of course. But I am very heartened by that, because I think that is a key underlying requirement for this body to responsibly take up IRS reform legislation. 
The road bringing us to this day has been long indeed. It was, after all, in the fall of 1995 that the legislation was enacted calling for the establishment of a commission on restructuring the IRS. Nearly 1 year ago, this commission submitted its report to Congress. 
After a period of congressional hearings and negotiation, compromise legislation was agreed upon by President Clinton, Secretary of Treasury Rubin, and the minority leadership of both Houses of Congress. With this support, it is not surprising that the House passed H.R. 2676 last November by an overwhelming margin of 424-6. The administration, since that time, has appointed former FBI and CIA Director William H. Webster to review the practices of the IRS and its Criminal Investigation Division. I think that is a very important and responsible step on the part of the administration, which is consistent with the direction and concerns expressed by both the House and the Senate. 
It has been frustrating that it has taken so long to bring this legislation to the floor. During the State of the Union 
Address at the beginning of the year, President Clinton called for passage of this bill as his first item of business. One week later, the majority leader pledged that IRS reform would be considered on this floor by March 30. Once again, unfortunately, the Senate did nothing. We spent days debating such items as renaming airports, but there was no action on this critical legislation. March 30 came and went, and so did an even more significant date for over 100 million Americans, and that was April 15, tax day. As the American people met the deadline for filing their tax forms, the Senate had not yet taken this legislation up on the floor. 
Finally, after much delay, this measure has reached the Senate floor. It has often been said that, `It is better late than never.' This week's Congressional Quarterly, a respected nonpartisan political publication, observes that one reason for the delay may have been a desire to raise campaign money. I certainly hope that was not the case. I believe that this legislation could, in fact, go a long way toward addressing many of the fundamental organizational problems that we see in the IRS today. That agency, as we all know very well, has antiquated computer systems, customer service phone lines that typically have busy signals, and many other operational inefficiencies. Furthermore, we have all heard about the large number of complaints about overzealous enforcement, rude service, and simple inability to get a clear answer. These are problems that clearly must be addressed. 
Of course, it should be recognized that during the course of Senate hearings, the IRS was not in a position to refute individual cases brought before the committee because of their confidentiality restrictions, and so the `rest of the story,' as is sometimes heard, went untold. Nonetheless, it is clear, both through hearings and individual complaints to our respective offices, that there have been abuses. There is no room for that, and there ought to be zero tolerance for that abuse. 
This bill will create an IRS governance and oversight board, which will be charged with overseeing the long-term strategic and operational plans for the agency. Personnel policies will be made more flexible. Expanded use of electronic filing will become a significant goal, with the hope that by the year 2007 only 20 percent of the tax returns will be filed on paper. 
Additionally, this bill will expand taxpayer rights. The burden of proof in Tax Court proceedings will lie with the IRS rather than with the taxpayer. Penalties will be allowed for IRS collection activities that negligently violate the Internal Revenue Code. Relief will be granted to spouses who are innocent of an underpayment filed on a return. Taxpayers will be granted expanded confidentiality protection as well as explicit notice of their rights. 
One of the more overlooked provisions of this bill, however, is perhaps one of the most important. The bill states--albeit in a sense of the Congress, nonetheless an important expression of the point of view of this body--that front-line IRS technical experts should be heard during congressional consideration of tax legislation in an effort to avoid additional complexity to the Tax Code. It has been Congresses and Presidents, after all, not the IRS, that have been responsible for creating a Tax Code which is overly complex and difficult to enforce. 
In a sense, the IRS has been an easy target for this whole debate, as has always been the case, I suppose. Few people like an agency responsible for collecting taxes. 
We must instead recognize, however, that a great deal of the responsibility for this problem rests on the doorstep of Congress itself. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, for example, while an excellent piece of legislation in very many respects, contains hundreds of new tax provisions, most of which increased the complexity of the Tax Code. We have in this debate the remarkable inconsistency of those who decry the complexity of the Tax Code on the one hand, but never miss an opportunity to worsen the situation by supporting every conceivable tax provision complication that comes along. 
I do have a serious reservation already expressed at the outset, and that is the Senate version of the bill as it now stands is expected to cost the Treasury $19.3 billion over the next 10 years. The proposed offsets are nearly $10 billion short of paying for this cost, meaning this bill, until it is amended, is in violation of the pay-as-you-go rules in the Budget Act, and costing three times the cost of the House-passed IRS reform legislation. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I believe it is extremely important that we maintain the budget discipline that has brought us the first balanced unified budget in three decades, and not jeopardize even as worthy a cause as this. I look forward, again, to reviewing the chairman's offers that he will raise later on in this debate. 
Additionally, I would be remiss if I failed to point out there are, in fact, a great number of IRS employees who deserve to be recognized for the exemplary service they provide for this Nation. Although I have certainly heard my share of complaints about the IRS, I have also heard from constituents who relate their stories of problems they have had. I am also very much aware of IRS employees who go about their duties every day as public servants in a professional and competent and able manner. We in Congress must be careful not to use too broad a brush in the heat of this debate. The vast majority of IRS employees are good and capable public servants with a tough job on their hands. The fact is that fact has been lost as we listened to one side of the story, one side that does indeed, however, need to be corrected. 
But I think it is important for us to go about this debate and recognize that on the one hand elected officials have created a complex Tax Code, though we want aggressive tax collection in order to address the problem of tax evasion in this country, which costs the taxpayers $100 billion a year in uncollected taxes, an unfair tax on those Americans who fairly and legally pay their taxes. So on the one hand we want the IRS to be aggressive about making those collections, but on the other hand we also want an IRS with a human face on it that recognizes that intimidation and overaggressiveness has no place. This is a fine line to walk--a line that has been crossed in numerous instances about unfortunate situations with the IRS--but one that is difficult to walk in some instances. 
Mr. President, I look forward to the debate on this legislation. It is a positive step forward in our efforts to create a tax system that is simpler and less burdensome on taxpayers. We cannot rest with the debate on this bill, however, since the more difficult and more complex job lies ahead. To truly resolve this problem, we will need to get to the ultimate source, which is the complexity and the difficulty of the Tax Code itself, and there the guilty party is not the IRS but the Congress itself. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate approval of extending North Atlantic Treaty Organization membership to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. For me this issue is very clear, admitting these countries into NATO will strengthen the Organization, reinforce new democracies, renew the American commitment to European security, and reaffirm American leadership in international relations and diplomacy. 
The United States plays a pivotal role in international relations because of our position as the world's only military and economic superpower, and as the world's strongest democracy. The existence of NATO is one of our best hopes for relieving much of the burden of that role. NATO initiatives can prevent international incidents from becoming serious military conflicts by encouraging member nations to work together to resolve conflicts. The success of NATO initiatives depends entirely on the support and participation of member nations. Ratification of this NATO expansion resolution is a test of whether the United States will stay engaged in a changing and evolving Europe. 
If NATO was not regularly reinforced and reinvigorated, the world's only superpower, the United States, would necessarily be involved in every international conflict and crisis. There is overwhelming bipartisan support for the notion that the United States taxpayer should not be responsible for policing the world, and that this should increasingly be an international responsibility. While I share this belief, I also have a personal interest in NATO expansion. My oldest son Brooks is in Bosnia as part of a NATO support effort. As NATO becomes more inclusive, the chances of going to war for all countries decreases. Likewise, as more countries join NATO, spreading the burden of conflict resolution and peacekeeping, fewer American soldiers will be needed abroad. This is a positive blessing for all Americans. 
Nevertheless, there are some who oppose the expansion of NATO and others who would like to place limitations on expansion, eroding the body's effectiveness. Because Russia and the rest of the world know that NATO is a defensive peacekeeping body, not an offensive regime, the current fears that an expanded NATO will directly threaten relations with non-NATO member neighbors are inflated. Instead, including eastern European countries in NATO will lead to increased stability in the region, something good for all countries throughout the world. Additionally, efforts to preclude other countries from joining NATO over a specified time period and attempts to limit the powers of the Organization are not well thought out. Limiting the mission of NATO would not be wise, particularly because we would be limiting our own abilities in the future. And a mandated pause would undermine the open door commitment that NATO has had since 1949. All countries have always been welcome to join the fold of NATO and all countries should forever remain welcome to join an Organization committed to peace and security. The United States cannot walk away from the role of leadership in Europe. By what we have witnessed in Bosnia, Europe is at a very fragile stage. We must embrace the European countries that wish to be a part of a world alliance for peace and security, and we have a moral obligation to strengthen Europe and reduce the possibility of war in the region. The door to NATO must remain fully open, not half closed, to those nations equipped to shoulder the responsibility and reforms necessary to meet NATO membership standards. 
With regard to the cost of NATO expansion, I believe that equitable financial involvement of member nations should be enforced. The U.S. should do what it can to support NATO to an extent equal to efforts of other countries involved. It is imperative that NATO expansion costs be kept as low as possible, and I do not believe that substantial expenditures to upgrade the new entry militaries is necessary or wise. Instead, I applaud the efforts of NATO to prioritize communications infrastructure, language skills, and strategic training for new members over big ticket items as the immediate criteria for NATO membership. It should also be noted that the governments of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic estimate that they would spend more on defense, not less, if they remain outside NATO. Although the United States will have a proportional increase in overall NATO expenditures, I believe the cost of forgoing NATO expansion is much greater. 
For these reasons, I fully support Senate approval of extending North Atlantic Treaty Organization membership to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Admitting these countries into NATO will strengthen the Organization and reaffirm American leadership in international relations and diplomacy. President Clinton announced his support for NATO enlargement in 1994 and in 1997 the Senate held over ten hearings on this issue. Debate on this issue has been extensive and thorough. NATO expansion is good for America and for the world.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President I am pleased to introduce legislation today that will foster job growth and job creation in distressed communities. This important legislation, the `Reemployment Tax Credit Act of 1988,' will provide needed assistance to communities when they are impacted by significant job losses. 
Twice in the last year, communities in my state have suffered the difficult repercussions of massive job losses in the area. The circumstances in Huron and those in the Northern Hills region differed considerably, however, in both instances the job losses affected far reaching elements of the local economy. I proudly introduce this legislation to enhance the ability of distressed communities to address the challenges of sudden economic dislocation. 
This bill will extend the existing Work Opportunity Tax Credit to include dislocated workers affected by plant closings or other events resulting in extensive job losses. This tax credit accelerates opportunities for business growth and expansion in distressed communities therefore decreasing unemployment insurance expenditures, reducing the flight of dislocated workers, allowing families to remain in their community and in their homes. It serves to stabilize the local economy and minimize the negative impacts on other local businesses. 
The most successful and immediate action to address economic dislocation is to reemploy workers. The Reemployment Tax Credit Act of 1998 will make a serious and positive impact on the growth and prosperity of our communities. I urge my colleagues to support this effort to provide distressed communities with this critical assistance to help them recover from extraordinary economic hardship.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, over the past year, some remarkable developments have taken place at the University of South Dakota (USD) involving the advancement of public service. The South Dakota Board of Regents has designated the University as a public service center of excellence,' the Farber Fund which is committed to assisting students with experiences helpful to a future in public service has continued to grow, and the University's political science program has prospered. 
There are a great many people responsible for these positive developments, but undoubtedly the person who has contributed the most, both in terms of effort and vision, has been Dr. W.O. Farber. I have a special fondness for Bill Farber because he was chairman of the USD political science department (then referred to as the government department') when I was completing my undergraduate work there, and later Dr. Farber was instrumental in assisting me with my graduate studies. But beyond personal friendship, Dr. Farber has become an unequaled institution in our state--a voice for reason, progress and integrity respected by all. 
Dr. Farber presented an important lecture this past year at the dedication of Farber Hall in the beautifully restored Old Main on the USD campus. I believe that all Americans would benefit from Dr. Farber's wisdom shared with us at that time and also by the Farber Testament' which dates to our nation's bicentennial in 1976.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the `Railroad Car Visibility Act,' requiring that all railroad cars have some form of visible marker such as reflectors or reflective tape. 
The purpose of this legislation is to reduce the number of accidents with both moving trains at rail crossings, and with rail cars parked on sidings. In South Dakota a number of such accidents have occurred recently at rural and small town rail crossings and sidings which are often unprotected or unlighted. Such accidents occur in rural areas across the country. 
As a result, last year I urged the Department of Transportation (DOT) to take appropriate measures to improve railroad car visibility. While DOT has begun enforcing rules governing locomotive visibility, rail cars are still not required to have reflective lighting. However, DOT research concludes that `retroreflective materials are useful and satisfactory for enhancing the visibility of railroad cars.' 
This legislation has the support of both South Dakota's legislature and Governor Janklow. For relatively little cost, this legislation will improve railroad car visibility and thereby reduce the number of accidents, unnecessary injuries and deaths at rail crossings and sidings. Therefore I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and work with me to secure its passage.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California and applaud her great leadership on what I think is one of the critical issues in our Nation today. 
I think it needs to be emphasized that the after-school program amendment being offered by Senator Boxer is not an alternative to the underlying Coverdell bill. Unlike other amendments that we have considered today, this is an add-on that is independent of the funding that is committed to the Coverdell legislation. 
I have been holding meetings all around my State of South Dakota, which is an overwhelmingly rural State. The Senator from California represents a State with large urban areas. One of the things that we share is a very strong sense from parents, from child care providers, teachers and school administrators, and from everyone who follows this issue that after-school programs are among the most important items on which we should focus our attention. 
In fact, the Republican Governor of my State has played a leading role in our State in trying to better utilize our school resources, recognizing that working moms are a larger and larger percentage of the work force. Welfare is pushing more and more people, mostly working moms, into the workplace because we have provided bipartisan support for that goal. We have increasing numbers of latchkey kids in all of our communities, large and small. After-school programs for these children are either nonexistent or far too expensive. We have studies from our law enforcement officials indicating overwhelmingly that between the hours of 3 to 6 in the afternoon is the greatest amount of juvenile crime, alcohol and drug experimentation, and sexual experimentation. All this takes place because we have an entire generation of young people in unsupervised settings, and these problems are becoming more widespread. 
I applaud Senator Boxer and her effort to come up with an amendment that not only addresses this key issue but does it in a way that does not create new Federal bureaucracy, does not federalize anything but instead utilizes local resources, leaves the options and the administration and the decisions at the local level. Because of all of these strong reasons, I think this is a very positive and constructive contribution to the underlying legislation, and I certainly again applaud the Senator's leadership, and yield back the time to her.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I express my strong support for the sense of the Senate resolution commemorating the efforts of the Ziolkowski family over the past fifty years in their endeavor to honor the great Oglala Sioux leader Tasunke Witko, or Crazy Horse, through creation of the Crazy Horse Memorial. The Crazy Horse Memorial is a nonprofit cultural, educational, and humanitarian project dedicated to Native Americans throughout North America. The 50th anniversary of the first blast at the memorial site will occur on June 3, 1998, in my home state of South Dakota. 
Crazy Horse was one of this nation's greatest Native American warriors and spiritual leaders, who fought to defend the rights and lives of his people and all Native Americans throughout his short life. He is widely remembered for leading a force of Cheyenne and Oglala Sioux warriors to victory over George Armstrong Custer in the Battle of Little Big Horn. Crazy Horse was born on Rapid Creek in 1840, and was killed when he was only 37 years of age. During his life he was a great leader of his people. Native Americans agree he did not have an equal as a warrior or a chief. He gave submissive allegiance to no man, white or Indian, and claimed his inalienable rights as an Indian to wander at will over the hunting grounds of his people. He wanted only peace and a way of living for his people. 
In 1940, several Sioux Indian chiefs invited the late sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski to create a memorial to their great leader, Crazy Horse, by carving a tribute to him in the Black Hills on what is popularly known as `Thunderhead Mountain.' The Memorial was dedicated on June 3, 1948 with the first blast on the Thunderhead Mountain at which time Mr. Ziolkowski vowed that creation of the Memorial would be a nonprofit educational and cultural project, financed solely through private means, and wholly without government funding. Korczak Ziolkowski dedicated his life to creation of the Crazy Horse Memorial, up until his death on October 20, 1982. 
Once complete, the Crazy Horse Memorial will be the largest sculpture in the world standing 563 feet high and 641 feet long. I am pleased that the Senate will recognize June 3, 1998, as the 50th anniversary of the first blast on Thunderhead Mountain, the first step towards completion of the Crazy Horse Memorial. I would like to congratulate the fifty years of efforts of Korczak Ziolkowski, his wife Ruth Ziolkowski, and their children in creating the Crazy Horse Memorial and notethat the creation of the Memorial from its inception on June 3, 1948 to the present day was accomplished through private donations and completely without federal funding. 
One of many great and patriotic Indian heroes, Crazy Horse's tenacity of purpose, his modest life, his unfailing courage, and his tragic death set him apart and above the others. Completion of the Crazy Horse Memorial will serve as a lasting tribute to the great Oglala Sioux warrior and spiritual leader, Crazy Horse, and to all Native Americans.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to recognize the one year anniversary of one of the worst natural disasters to hit Watertown, South Dakota, and the amazing fact that, only one year later, Watertown continues to grow and prosper. 
Referred to by South Dakotans simply as `the flood,' the events surrounding April 5 and 6, 1997, had the potential to cripple one of the state's fastest growing cities. Instead, battling rising waters and a late season snowstorm, the residents of Watertown, South Dakota, overcame adversity and forged a true community, defined by selfless acts of caring, cooperation, and good will. 
Few South Dakotans will forget the winter and spring preceding the April floods. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane cleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead livestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace. As if surviving the severe winter cold was not challenge enough, residents of Watertown could hardly imagine the extent of damage Mother Nature had yet to inflict with a 500-year flood. 
Watertown residents could sense the impending flood. The first snow of the season fell in October, and six consecutive months of record-breaking snowfall covered ground that was already saturated from years of unusually wet winters. As the first warm days of spring slowly melted layers of the snowpack, Watertown residents began planning for flooding. Sandbags and earthen berms ringed Lake Kampeska and the Big Sioux River. However, despite careful planning, on April 5, an unexpected blizzard hit the state, devastating the area. Everything froze, creating further concerns about what was going to happen once the water began flowing again. 
The unusual weather mix caused water levels to surge in a few hours. Record levels on the Big Sioux River and Lake Kampeska forced over 5,000 residents of Watertown, or one-fourth the city's population, to evacuate their homes. Over one-third of the city was without sewer and water for three weeks. The headline of the Watertown Public Opinion on April 6 read `Watertown in Peril,' and I will never forget the image of homeowners and neighbors, shrouded in a late-season snow storm, sandbagging against the rising waters of the Big Sioux River and Lake Kampeska. 
A number of individuals and organizations in Watertown are responsible for the amazing fact that, despite causing millions of dollars of damage to property, the 1997 flood failed to claim any lives. The work of Mayor Brenda Barger and other community leaders held Watertown together with their strength and direction. The city's ad-hoc crisis center brought together local and county officials, volunteer agencies including the Red Cross, Salvation Army, Lutheran Social Services, and others, to brainstorm and compile `resource lists' of expected needs including equipment, people, and funds. 
Local volunteers, students, prisoners, and National Guard personnel were recruited to first fight the rising waters with sandbags and then help clean-up as the waters receded. In the following days, over 750 port-a-potties were deployed on the lawns of those families who could return to their homes. Water trucks were brought in to provide people with a fresh water supply, and repairs to the damaged water treatment plant were completed ahead of schedule. 
While those of us from South Dakota will never forget the destruction wrought by `the flood,' I was heartened to witness first-hand and hear accounts of individuals coming together in Watertown to protect homes, farms, and lives from rising flood waters. 
Mr. President, April 6 marks the one year anniversary of this terrible natural disaster in Watertown. However, residents of Watertown should look back on April 6, 1997, and be proud of the way they and their neighbors came together and worked side by side to see their community survive. It is this community spirit and pride that will continue to make Watertown `South Dakota's Rising Star.'

<TEXT>
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the amendment that is being offered is with the cooperation of Chairman Domenici. It is cosponsored by Senators Daschle, Dorgan, Bingaman, Wellstone, McCain, Kohl, Conrad and Murray, and it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which is designed to reflect on the crisis that we have with Indian school funding in the United States today. This is an issue that Chairman Domenici has shared with me as a matter of great concern on the Senate Budget Committee. 
We recognize the budget resolution assumes $166 million will be allocated for Indian school repair work and replacement work. However, we recognize this is part of the budget resolution and is not binding on the Appropriations Committee. 
There is a need to raise the visibility of the very real crisis that exists in terms of BIA school funding and replacement needs. That is the purpose of this sense of the Senate. The BIA manages some 143 schools within the United States. It is a Federal responsibility. This is not a question of whether the Federal Government ought to be involved in these schools or not. In this instance, these schools are Federal property and it is a Federal responsibility. 
We have a repair and replacement backlog now of about $754 million. The rate at which we have been replacing some 60 schools that currently are in need of replacement has been at about one per year. So obviously the backlog is getting larger and larger as we go about this kind of underfunded replacement and renovation. 
Mr. President, 40 percent of the BIA students attending class are attending class in portable classrooms. We have a fast-growing population attending these schools, and it is clear that something far different from what we have been doing in the past is absolutely essential if, in fact, we are going to meaningfully address this backlog. 
It is our concern that we have to infuse more resources into the backlog problem, and that we have greater direction from the White House itself, from the BIA itself, relative to a concrete plan to get this done over a relatively modest timeframe, over the next 5 years. 
So this resolution calls on the administration to work with us in arriving at a plan that is infused with sufficient funds to make significant progress over these coming years on this backlog. This resolution will send a signal, and I think an important signal, to the appropriators and to the administration that this is a crisis that we recognize and we acknowledge, and for which there is a bipartisan concern. 
So that is the thrust of this resolution. I commend Chairman Domenici for working with me, and for the work of his staff, working with my staff, trying to arrive at a strategy that is constructive and is meaningful on this problem. The Senator represents a State with a significant Indian population, suffering many of the same problems that the Native American population in my State of South Dakota suffer. So this is a problem about which we jointly share a great concern. 
The chairman is commended for a longstanding commitment to trying to enhance opportunities and the quality of life for the Native American population of his State and around the United States in general. This is one area where we both agree; I believe that higher visibility and a higher level of commitment is badly needed.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, we have before the Senate today, and will have on into next week, the budget resolution which has been reported from Senate Budget Committee, on which I serve. I commend ranking member Lautenberg from New Jersey for his leadership as well as Chairman Domenici for his work on the budget resolution. Obviously, we have differences relative to some components of the budget resolution. I think the current resolution is significantly lacking in many serious ways. At the same time, however, I want to acknowledge the extraordinary circumstance that we now find ourselves in as Americans here in the spring of 1998. 
Many of us recognize that, upon his election 5 years ago, President Clinton faced a pool of red ink totaling around $292 billion per year, a pool of red ink that had exploded through the 1980s. When President Carter left office, this nation had accumulated a national debt of around $1 trillion. At the end of the 1980s, the accumulated debt of this country was four times that, in the $4 trillion range, and growing beyond sight. 
After five successive years in reducing the annual budget deficit, we now find ourselves, in this fiscal year, with a budget surplus as measured under the unified budget-scoring system. We are in the black for the first time in 30 years. The last time the Federal Government had a unified budget surplus was in 1969 during the Lyndon Johnson administration when taxes were raised in order to pay for the Vietnam war. We slipped back into deficit again and then drowned in red ink through the 1980s. 
So, we find ourselves in an extraordinary time. We must decide what kind of framework our Federal Government should have, and what kind of framework our budget should have, going on into the next millennium. After 5 years of budget discipline--in no small measure as a consequence of a very difficult vote on the 1993 budget reconciliation bill, which laid much of the groundwork for this progress--we find ourselves with record low inflation, record low unemployment, one of the highest levels of housing ownership that we have seen in decades, record low levels of crime and, again, the first budget surplus, at least under a unified budget, that we have seen in 30 years. 
Where do we go from here? That is the question that the pending budget resolution asks. This is not just a budget issue. This is one that really reflects the values and the priorities and the philosophy of the American people. It has enormous ramifications for us all. 
There are some very fundamental areas where the two political parties are in agreement on the budget resolution. I am thankful for that. I am pleased we have found common ground, first of all, in deciding that the budget resolution should sustain and continue the budget discipline mechanism that has been a factor in producing a budget surplus for the first time in 30 years. We will continue on a pay-as-you-go basis. No more new spending unless the cost is offset by spending decreases or revenue adjustments; no more tax cuts, even in an election year, unless those cuts are paid for by reduced spending or revenue increases somewhere else in the budget. 
This is the kind of discipline that one would have thought should have been present in our Government for 200 years but, in fact, has been present for just this past decade. It is the kind of discipline that we must sustain. While there are some who, I think, are expressing some sense of giddiness over a budget surplus, we need to recognize that that surplus will remain only with continued budget restraint and discipline; that we must face the question of budget priorities; and that the election year Christmas trees that took place in the past are no longer an accepted part of budget strategy in this day and age. 
Secondly, there is agreement between the parties, at least in the Senate Budget Committee, that the so-called budget surpluses ought to be preserved for the purpose of strengthening Social Security. We ought not to run off in any number of directions with tax cuts or spending increases premised on utilizing those particular dollars. These so-called surpluses are really surpluses only if the Social Security trust funds are included in the budget, which is the nature of the unified budget. 
We have an agreement on the budget resolution that has emerged from our committee that those two underlying principles will be continued. I acknowledge the very great importance of those two underlying principles. 
There are some great differences, however, that I am hopeful can be addressed with amendments during the course of debate this coming week. 
One of the most fundamental differences, frankly, is how to utilize any resources that might be generated by a tobacco settlement. We all understand that a tobacco settlement is still only a possibility--it may occur or it may not--and the terms of any tobacco settlement ought to be driven by the merits of that issue itself. We should not see the settlement as simply a revenue generator for other purposes, regardless of how worthy they might be. 
Nonetheless, the President in his budget and Democrats in their alternative budget recognize that we do need to be thinking about how to utilize most constructively additional resources if they are, in fact, made possible by a tobacco settlement. Therein lies one of the most fundamental differences between the two parties. 
We are in agreement on preserving the Social Security trust funds; we are in agreement that we need to shore up Medicare. I think few people have done more to protect, preserve and strengthen Medicare than my colleagues on the Democratic side. We are pleased, however, to have support from our Republican colleagues on an issue that ought not to be partisan and one where we should be able to find common ground. 
The budget resolution that is coming to this floor, over the objections of the White House and over the objections of Democrats on the Budget Committee, sees to it that none of the potential new resources from a settlement will be used for health care for children; for schools; for child care; for expanding the National Institutes of Health research on cancer, heart disease, and so on; for rural development, or for deterring youth smoking. That is not to say that there are not attempts in other areas of the budget to touch on some of these issues, but certainly none of the tobacco funds could be used for these purposes. 
I have to say, simply being candid and looking across the political landscape in the Budget Committee, that what we have here is not so much a concern about the long-term viability of Medicare--we all share a concern for that. It seems to me that those who are making certain that none of the tobacco money may be used for many of the other problems created by use of tobacco, or for child care or education, are less concerned about Medicare, than they are simply opposed to creating a better partnership among the Federal, State, and local governments, and public and private entities, to address the problems of education and child care and health care in general. 
Mr. President, we have some enormous needs that the Federal Government cannot fix by itself, nor should it attempt to fix by itself, but where a constructive partnership makes a lot of common sense. 
We have found over the last several budget debates that the American people are not terribly ideological in the sense that they are far right or they are far left, they tend to be fairly pragmatic and down the center. That is why Democrats on the Budget Committee attempted to pass an alternative budget. In doing so, we recognized that replacing and renovating schools has always been and will always be primarily a function of local school districts 
and local citizens, taking it upon themselves to determine whether a particular school needs to be replaced or renovated. Those are local decisions and will remain so. But we have suggested that a small portion of these resources ought to be used to help buy down interest rates for the bond issues that are supported at the local level. 
Because of the enormous backlog of school repair and renovation work that is out there--it is in small towns, it is in large cities, suburban areas, rural and urban alike. As we head into this next millennium, we understand that those countries which focus on quality education and developing the brain power of the next generation are nations that will do well; those nations that neglect those resources, those nations that think these needs will somehow take care of themselves will slide backwards. 
We need a new commitment to education and to providing the resources for education, not simply for the intrinsic value of increasing the intellectual capability of our young people--although that certainly is the principal goal--but also from even a purely dollars-and-cents point of view. Our economy cannot thrive, our communities cannot prosper, unless we do better at making sure that every young person in this country has an opportunity to develop his or her God-given talents to the maximum extent possible, and that the resources are there to make it happen. We must have a public and private, a Federal, State, and local partnership that can make it happen. 
So it is with some frustration that I view this budget resolution, in its current form, as a wasted opportunity. 
I am hopeful that we can restore some of these priorities in the context of a balanced budget in a way that does, in fact, make some of these key investments in other areas as well. 
In the area of child care, we have an increasingly stark reality of more and more children being unsupervised, not having constructive after-school programs, that they are getting along on a latchkey basis. More and more often we have single-parent households. We also have more dual-income households, not necessarily because they want that to be their circumstance but because economic reality dictates that circumstance. 
Yet, at the age when children have the greatest brain development, when it is determined how well these children will succeed in their later years in terms of their fitting into society and being constructive citizens, that is the one age where we make the least commitment, where we have the greatest patchwork system, where quality is uneven, where affordability is uneven. 
I have held child care meetings all around my State with parents and child care providers and other concerned citizens. I am pleased that the Republican Governor of my State is very supportive of strong new initiatives for after-school programs and for child-care. We ought to be able to bridge this nonsensical partisan gap and look after the needs of our kids and the future generations of this country. That means, again, some level of partnership, not a system that is micromanaged out of Washington or that involves a new bureaucracy out of Washington. We do none of that in the Democratic alternative budget. We allow the decisionmaking to be made at the local level. We allow the initiative to be there. We allow tremendous innovation at the State and local level, but we believe there is a partnership needed for those communities and for those nonprofit organizations and for those schools to make a viable investment in our children. 
Mr. President, there is no funding for President Clinton's education initiatives in this budget resolution. There is no help for school construction. Fourteen million children currently attend classes in buildings that need major renovations; 7 million kids in our country go to school in buildings that currently have safety code violations; 16 million children are in classrooms without proper ventilation, heating, or air conditioning. 
This is where we get on to a particular concern of mine involving Native American children. We have currently 60 BIA schools that need complete replacement. We are replacing them at 
the rate of one per year. I thank Chairman Domenici for his sharing a concern with me about this. We haven't really reached an entirely satisfactory solution to this problem, but I do appreciate that we have joined together in the inclusion of report language expressing our concern to the appropriators that additional funds be allocated for these Indian schools. These schools have some children from the most difficult circumstances imaginable, with 40 percent studying in portable classrooms, with dropout rates and other attendant problems of poverty and desperation at such high levels. 
I thank the chairman for his work with me on this very significant problem, and I understand his profound appreciation of the challenges we face in that regard. 
So, we have a budget resolution, Mr. President, that contains some strong underlying principles, and I am very, very pleased at that, because I think by maintaining a balanced budget, we can do more than almost any other single thing the Federal Government can do to reduce the cost of borrowing money. That makes going to college, buying a house, buying a car, expanding a business, hiring more employees, all more affordable. That will do more to maintain America's role as the world's great economic superpower than any other single thing we can do, and there is strong bipartisan support in that regard. 
But we have these other fundamental differences that I am hopeful can be addressed, at least in part, in the course of this coming debate on the Senate budget resolution. We can create a framework for investment in our communities, investment in our kids, in our schools, in health research, in a more meaningful way than the budget resolution that we currently have on the floor allows. 
We can do that. We can sustain Social Security, we can sustain Medicare, we can make other needed investments, while keeping the budget in balance. This is a remarkable point in time, one that many people thought would never occur in our lifetime. This, along with the fall of the Berlin Wall and some other events, are things that many people thought would not happen, but they are on the verge of happening. Now it is our responsibility in this body, the U.S. Senate, to make sure it happens in a responsible, sustainable way and we continue to make the key investments that will create the framework, create the foundation, for our country to prosper and to continue to grow, to create greater opportunity for all of its citizens. Not to guarantee success for anyone--that comes only about through their own labor, their own efforts, and their own talent--but to create the tools, the starting point for every American, regardless of his or her background, as an opportunity to prosper and to succeed. 
Mr. President, I want to make one additional comment unrelated directly to the budget resolution but on an issue which does impact our overall economy. I wish to express great, great concern over recent action by our colleagues in the other body who have failed to extend the ethanol fuel tax incentives that the Senate, by a large bipartisan majority, included in the ISTEA legislation. 
It appears, at this point, that our colleagues on the other side managed in effect to terminate a critically needed tax provision. This provision will not only allow ethanol fuel usage an opportunity to reach critical mass, a substantial benefit to farmers, but also will help clean our air and make this Nation less reliant on unstable Third World nations as sources of petroleum. At this point, however, it appears that there will not even be an opportunity for members of the other body to vote for an extension of the ethanol tax incentives. 
I am very concerned about this, and it is certainly my hope and expectation that Senate conferees, in the course of negotiating differences between the Senate and the House highway legislation, will give this a very high priority. It is important that we make the proper investments in our Nation's transportation infrastructure. 
It is also important that we move forward with a commonsense, cost-efficient strategy for expanding use of clean, American alternative fuels. That can only be done by the conferees on the Senate side looking after the interests of the American people in that regard when the conference committee comes about. 
So, Mr. President, this coming week should be tumultuous but very important for the American people as we deal with the fundamental issues in the budget for the coming fiscal year, as well as transportation and fuel strategy into the next century. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield back my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by Senators Enzi and Bryan with respect to restrictions on the activities of the Secretary of the Interior. While I appreciate the concerns of my colleagues on this issue, I do not believe that this emergency supplemental bill is the appropriate vehicle for this amendment and, I encourage my colleagues on the appropriations conference committee to carefully consider the impact that this amendment will have on the potential for progress between Indian tribes and state governments in this area. 
As written, this amendment would prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from proceeding with proposed regulations to create procedures to permit class III gaming, procedures which would basically facilitate state-tribal negotiations when other avenues are exhausted. There has been a stalemate in Indian gaming compact negotiations since the 1996 Supreme Court Seminole decision. In response, the Senate included language in the FY1998 Interior Appropriations bill sending a strong message to the Secretary that gaming compacts should not be entered into without state involvement. I believe the Secretary has heeded that Congressional directive through the rulemaking process, and that states have been encouraged to participate in the comment period required in the formation of federal regulations. 
Proponents of this amendment believe they are acting in the best interest of the states. However, eliminating the Secretary's ability to gather commentary and issue procedures to help facilitate dialog on Indian gaming goes against the states' interests. 
We are fortunate in South Dakota to have a relatively productive relationship between the state and the tribes on gaming issues. However, this amendment, offered without committee consideration or extensive debate, directly limits the federal role in maintaining the balance of tribal, state and federal interests in the gaming negotiation process and I must oppose this step. 
Federal law requires tribal governments to use gaming revenue to fund essential services such as education, law enforcement and economic development. Without due protection of the rights of tribal governments to negotiate gaming compacts, the entire foundation of tribal sovereignty and government-to-government relations is jeopardized. The uncertainty left by the Seminole case demands that the Department of the Interior and the Congress revisit existing gaming regulations and law. I will urge the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to continue moving forward on legislation to revisit the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). 
Mr. President, I am opposed to the amendment offered by Senators Enzi and Bryan and encourage my colleagues to closely examine any language agreed to by the conferees to ensure that the interests of states, tribes, and the federal government are maintained in the Indian gaming regulatory process.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to recognize an extraordinary group of young athletes from Northern State University in Aberdeen, South Dakota. The Northern State University Men's Basketball Team won the 1998 NCAA Division II North Central Regional Basketball Championship held on Sunday, March 8, 1998 in Brookings, South Dakota. In a battle of South Dakota basketball powers, NSU took charge in the final minute to win a hard-fought victory over South Dakota State University. The NSU Wolves, with a 27-5 record, ended the season in a close 67-63 loss to Virginia Union University in the 1998 NCAA Division II Elite Eight Tournament. 
The athletes that made this great season happen include Scott Hanson, Jared Miller, Todd Schlekeway, Ryan Miller, Kyle Johnson, Dan Fischer, Jim Sumption, Jake Phillips, Ross Pankratz, Dustin Undlin, Mark Rich, Ben Dahl, Jeff Rich, Andy Foster and Brad Hansen. Their coaches include: Bob Olson, Mike Hultz, Brad Christenson, Craig Smith and Kent Leiss. Team Managers are Joe Flynn and Justin Forde. The NSU strength coach is Doug Bull, and the training staff is directed by Lisa McIntyre. The NSU Wolves cheerleaders are Jennifer Eye, Tonya Bird, Jackie Hortes, Jaine Fauth, Erica Paulson, Gary Olson along with advisor Susan Rozell. 
I want to commend Coach Olson for providing outstanding leadership to the NSU team, and I also want to compliment Ryan Miller on his contribution of 45 points in the regional championship game. 
The State of South Dakota has much to be proud of in this accomplishment. I again want to congratulate all of these fine young athletes from Northern State University, and to all the many others who contributed to this outstanding accomplishment.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the recent confirmation of George McGovern as the United States Representative to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 
Having spent many years as a devoted public servant, Senator McGovern embodies the highest standards of dedication and integrity. I firmly believe he is the right person to represent this country as part of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and am pleased that my Senate colleagues supported his nomination to this post in an overwhelming bipartisan fashion. There is no person that I can think of alive today that is better prepared for the responsibility of improving nutrition, food production and distribution worldwide. 
Senator McGovern was not new to the arena of agricultural policy at the time of his election to the U.S. Senate. Having served under the Kennedy Administration as Director of the Food for Peace Program, George McGovern proved early that he had the ability to lead with vision and skill. As a United States delegate to the United Nations FAO Conference in 1961, Senator McGovern made the U.S. offer which led to the first World Food Program making freedom from hunger an international objective. Under the Ford and Carter Administrations, he was also a delegate to the U.N. where he gained esteem as a discerning statesman and cultivated international ties. 
In Congress, George McGovern was an advocate for the welfare and health of the people. While serving on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, he was an avid supporter of the food stamp program. As a member of that committee, he was active and effective in matters of child nutrition and hunger. As Chairperson of the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, he led the committee to assure an adequate diet for the poor and the elderly and for the improved health and well being of all Americans. Because I have always been a strong supporter of nutrition programs in the United States, especially food stamps, WIC, and school lunch programs, I understand the high importance and true value of his work to advance these policies. After Senator McGovern worked to make certain that all Americans have access to adequate nutrition, he in many ways came to symbolize Americans' `social conscience.' 
Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Senator McGovern on his new position and express my complete confidence that he will work with unbridled energy to serve the people by improving nutrition, food production, and distribution throughout the world. He is a true humanitarian and I'm proud he is representing South Dakota and our country to the United Nations.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I simply want to concur with Chairman D'Amato and to express my gratitude to him for his willingness to work with Senator Thomas and with me and with others who are very concerned about transit needs in rural areas, to recognize that there are very great and very real needs there. Yet there is a finite amount of money, and there are great needs as well in our urban areas. I thank him for having been willing to work with us to recognize that Chicago and New York are major urban areas that will indeed benefit by a significant new infusion of transit money but that, by massaging the budget carefully and coming up with a compromise that does not change the underlying formula system, it still provides a significant infusion of resources for our rural areas. 
I am very encouraged that we can arrive at a win-win situation. So I commend Chairman D'Amato. I also thank my colleague from my neighboring State of Wyoming, Senator Thomas, for his leadership and his very hard work on trying to devise an approach to this that will work. 
So I say to my colleague and my very good friend from Illinois that I think we are at a point now where we will be able to move on with a transit amendment that will be of enormous benefit to the State of Illinois, that will not change the formula, but will be able to do some more positive things for those of us in rural areas, including the rural areas in Illinois. I know that my colleague has great concern for those areas, as well, in her own State. So we will all, I think, benefit by this compromise.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to call your attention to the Little Hearts Day Care in Estelline, South Dakota, and to the community leaders who rose to new heights to create a day care center amid a child care shortage. 
Late last year, Estelline experienced a devastating child care shortage when two of the local child care providers closed their doors to pursue other endeavors. While this rural community wishes the best for these providers, Estelline was left in a state of crisis: all of the remaining day care services were filled to capacity, and working parents had no place to bring their children. 
In this time of alarm, community leaders, the Estelline Area Development Corporation, and the city worked together to locate a building to operate a non-profit day care center. Soon after, Donna Thompson, Glenda Thompson, and Kim Ward incorporated the Little Hearts Day Care. If it were not for the massive volunteer effort to renovate the vacant building, the Little Hearts Day Care would be little more than a glimmering idea of hope. Thousands of dollars of materials and hundreds of hours of labor were donated to renovate the building and to make the day care center safe for children. Volunteers cleaned, painted, and some even provided professional services such as plumbing and carpentry. I applaud the community of Estelline for their hard work in filling this void in child care. 
Our nation's children are its greatest asset and our most precious treasure. It is vital that we help them get the right start, nurture their development and provide for their well-being. Having held numerous child care meetings with providers, parents, and concerned officials all around our state, I am more convinced than ever that providing high quality, affordable child care is one of the most important issues South Dakota and our nation faces. In our state, we have one of the highest ratios of working moms in the country, coupled with one of the lowest per capita income levels. As a consequence, too many of our child care providers are being asked to provide professional, loving care with very marginal compensation. 
While I do not believe in `federalizing' child care, I do think our nation needs a federal-state-local partnership designed to provide local child care providers and parents with better options. This cooperative effort should avoid the creation of new bureaucracies and inflexible mandatory rules, while providing greater financial resources for parents and the entire range of child care providers. Training, standards improvement, nutrition assistance and the promotion of employer incentives for child care strategies should also be part of our effort. 
I am pleased that child care issues are receiving the attention of Congress and the Administration. I am proud to have cosponsored the Creating Improved Delivery of Child Care: Affordable, Reliable and Educational (CIDCARE) bill. This measure will help working families afford child care and will provide parents incentives to choose higher quality care. I am pleased that the President's proposal will establish a Child Care Provider Scholarship Fund. This measure will enable states to provide scholarship funds to students working toward a degree in child care. 
Quality child care is the first step in ensuring that the children of working parents grow up in a healthy environment, and I am pleased that the community of Estelline answered the call for action. 
Mr. President, as I yield the floor, I hope other communities throughout the nation will look to the Little Hearts Day Care and the city of Estelline, and benefit from this prime example of civic cooperation.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding time to me and also for his very constructive contribution towards working on a fair and equitable amendment to the transit provisions in the ISTEA II legislation that the Senate is considering. 
There is an understanding that an agreement has been reached which will allow for an additional $5 billion to be directed toward the transit needs of this country nationwide over the coming 5 years. 
I am supportive of this. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I certainly will do all I can to find offsets that will be necessary to make this funding a reality. But I think this funding for transit does afford each of our States an opportunity, a unique opportunity, for a win-win circumstance whereby the States that traditionally have drawn significant funds from transit will continue to have that kind of draw and, in fact, will have their transit needs enhanced, but those of us from States that tend to be rural or more recent population growth areas will also find some of our transportation needs also met. 
Currently, as the Senator from Wyoming has noted, eight States receive about 60 percent of all the transit funds in the country. The formula has not really been changed significantly since 1982, and there has been no opportunity during that time to allow for modest growth in transit programs in States and cities which historically have not received adequate funding to meet their public transportation needs. 
There will be spending offsets, as noted, that will make this $5 billion enhancement possible. It is important, obviously, that this initiative go forth in the context of a balanced Federal budget. I think we all share that across party lines. There is uniform support for that. But in order to reach these offsets, there also is no doubt that all 50 States will have to participate in providing some reductions in their programs to make this transit money available. It is all the more equitable, then, that all 50 States should at least, to some modest degree, share in the increase in transit funds. 
The States that currently are donor States--my home State of South Dakota is a donor; that is, we contribute much more to transit than we receive back--will remain donor States. I understand that. I accept that. There are other equities where my home State does better. The same would be said for the State of the Senator from Wyoming. His State will remain a donor State. Those States that are beneficiaries, that receive more than they pay in, will continue to receive more than they pay in. The amendment that Senator Thomas and I have put together would not change that fundamental reality. 
But what we do feel is that this is an opportunity, when there is this very significant growth in the overall pot of money available for transit, that 7 percent of the total pot be subject to some redistribution to recognize the contemporary realities that we now face. 
In order to address some of the concerns that have been raised with Senator Thomas and with me and with our staffs, we have made some changes. 
First, there will be no transferability provision in our amendment, so that the money which would be shifted to States 
that are currently being underfunded for their transit needs will not be allowed to then be shifted into highway construction or bridge repair or nontransit needs. 
There was some concern that this amendment was somehow a raid on transit funds for nontransit purposes. We want to make sure--make absolutely certain--that all of our colleagues understand that that is not the case, that the 7 percent component of the transit funds that would be redistributed would be strictly for transit needs. 
Secondly, it was expressed that there is some concern about whether a shifting of this 7 percent portion of the funds would somehow jeopardize donor States, what are called new-start funds. And I have heard some concern expressed. The fact is that under our amendment, no State which gains under the pending amendment will have their new-start funding cut next year. Under this amendment, we pay for the changes by making modest reductions from the donee States but not from attacking the new-start funds. 
Thirdly, the question has been raised whether this is need based or not, whether 30 to 35 States that would benefit by this have transit needs. Admittedly, the needs that we have in many of our areas where there are fast growing suburban areas, whether it is fast growing new younger cities or whether it is in rural areas, are different than the needs that our colleagues from New York or Chicago might have, but they are very great needs nonetheless. 
In my home State of South Dakota, we have a tremendous reliance on our rural transit needs, particularly for seniors to make it to health visits, for groceries, to get to congregate meal sites. All of these things, given the dispersal of the population, the very rural nature of the State, makes transit all the more critical. And it is critical, as well, in our Indian reservation areas. I have nine in my State where the need for access to quality nutrition, education, and medical care would be enormously enhanced by the availability of at least some minimal rural transit assistance. 
Currently, over 30 percent of our 206 vehicles providing rural transit in our State are 10 years old or older; 70 percent are 5 years old or older. We have had, in the course of the State, local, and Federal partnership to make rural transit a reality, a continuing hardship where some of our counties now, in fact, are terminating their transit programs. We cannot afford to see this kind of retreat, this kind of neglect, for rural transit needs in my State. 
So I think that anyone who takes a close look at our amendment will recognize the very modest nature of the amendment, that it is only 7 percent of a total pot, a vastly growing pot of money, that would be subject to some modest change of redistribution to meet the contemporary transit needs; that, in fact, the overwhelming share of States would benefit by this redistribution; and it would not incur a significant reduction really in the States that currently have the traditional great benefit from the transit programs. 
So, again, this is a modest step, but I think it is a modest step in the right direction, one that will contribute greater equity, one that will contribute to the creation of what is truly a national transit strategy. And I think every one of our colleagues who come from the traditional large recipient States will recognize that a national commitment to transit assistance will be all the stronger if, in fact, more than eight 
States benefit but that all 50 States benefit to a greater degree than is currently the case. 
So, again, I thank my colleague, Senator Thomas from Wyoming, for his work on this in our effort to craft a reasonable and a balanced and a modest change, but one that nonetheless ought to be of great help to the large majority of States as we debate the transit amendment and the infusion of new money into the transit provisions of the ISTEA II legislation. 
So, with that, I encourage my colleagues to be very supportive of this and to examine the language of our amendment carefully. 
Mr. President, I yield back my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the heroic actions of DesRon 61. DesRon 61 consisted of 9 U.S. destroyers which participated in the only surface action in Tokyo Bay during World War II. As part of Admiral William `Bull' Halsey's Task Group 38.1, DesRon 61 entered Tokyo Bay on July 22, 1945 and proceeded to engage a Japanese convoy which was attempting to leave the bay undetected. Under the command of Captain T.H. Hederman, DesRon 61 opened fire on the convoy sinking several Japanese ships and forcing the convoy to retreat back into Tokyo Bay. 
All of us, as Americans, owe a great debt of gratitude to those who served our nation with such dedication and patriotism. Our losses in World War II, especially in the Pacific Theater, were considerable, and we always should remember the brave men and women who fought to defend the freedom and liberty that is so precious to all of us. Mr. President, I would like to commend and thank the crew members of DesRon 61 for their valiant service. Their action that July night, as well as the heroic deeds of all our armed forces in the Pacific, helped defeat the Japanese empire and restore freedom in that theater of the world.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues from North Dakota, Senators Dorgan and Conrad, and our distinguished Minority Leader and my friend from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, in introducing this legislation which will clarify that licensed pharmacies are not included, nor were they ever intended to be included, in the surety bond requirements imposed on certain health care providers under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. At a time when we are properly addressing the rise in fraud and abuse of the Medicare system, we must also be cognizant of the impact some of these efforts will have on the intended beneficiaries of Medicare. This misapplication of the surety bond requirement is one such circumstance, and I urge my colleagues to join us in clarifying that licensed pharmacies were not intended to be in the scope of the surety bond requirement. 
While the vast majority of health care providers are honest and do their best to comply with Medicare rules, repeated studies have found a great amount of Medicare fraud within the national system--some estimates would place the cost to the American taxpayers at an incredible $24 billion per year. These are dollars that could be used to better compensate honest health care providers, or expand Medicare coverage. I have always been supportive of, and will continue to strongly support, these efforts to crack down on fraud and abuse. We must continue our efforts in that regard. 
As part of the effort to curb fraud and abuse in the Medicare system, last year Congress enacted a $50,000 surety bond requirement for home health agencies, Durable Medical Equipment (DME) providers, rehabilitation services providers and ambulance services. The law was aimed at fly-by-night home health agencies and DME providers who abuse the system, and not small rural pharmacies. Unfortunately, these pharmacies have been caught up in this broadly written provision of last year's budget reconciliation. 
Under the definitions incorporated in this surety bond provision, all pharmacies are considered to be DME providers if even a small portion of their business is DME-related. Thus, they must obtain a minimum $50,000 surety bond regardless of how much or how little of their business consists of providing durable medical equipment to Medicare beneficiaries. 
The surety bond requirement is intended to ensure that the federal government will have recourse in the event of fraud. Many of the perpetrators of fraud and abuse are fly-by-night organizations that can quickly disappear. Many rural pharmacies, however, only offer DME as a service to their Medicare patients. It is not a major profit center for them, and many will stop providing this service rather than undergo the expense of obtaining a minimum $50,000 bond. Rural Medicare patients would then have greater difficulty in obtaining needed DME. 
The surety bond requirement attacks fraud indirectly, by mandating financial accountability. Pharmacies engaging in fraud will still be liable for their actions. This bill would clarify that the federal surety bond requirement does not apply to licensed pharmacies. It allows states to enforce their own licensing requirements, which can include surety bonds if states feel it necessary. 
Mr. President, while we must continue our efforts to root out the fraud and abuse that is plaguing our Medicare system, this important clarification will help ensure that our efforts are appropriately targeted and do not have the unintended consequence of denying critical services to Medicare beneficiaries, and I urge my colleagues to support our efforts and to support this bill.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank the brave South Dakotans who are part of the latest deployment of American troops to the Persian Gulf. The men and women from Ellsworth Air Force Base and the South Dakota Air National Guard embody the spirit of all Americans by assisting the international effort to rid Iraq of nuclear and biological weapons. 
Saddam Hussein's deportation of United Nations weapons inspectors and his continued obstruction of international monitoring efforts clearly show that Iraq does not desire to live by international rules of peace and commerce. 
We now face the possibility of using force against Saddam Hussein to ensure that Iraq does not develop the capability to make and use weapons of mass destruction, and our thoughts and prayers are with our American troops stationed overseas and their families back home. We have faith in the readiness of our troops and know that, if called upon, they will succeed in their mission. The 114th Fighter Wing of the South Dakota Air National Guard will be enforcing the no-fly zone over southern Iraq, a task they have performed since 1992. The recent deployment is also a historic occasion for Ellsworth Air Force Base because it marks the first time B-1 bombers have been deployed in a potential military conflict. 
I am a strong supporter of the National Guard working alongside active duty personnel in response to future emergencies, both at home and abroad. The Persian Gulf War was the truest test of this strategy and illustrated the Guard's ability to be trained, mobilized, deployed, fight alongside active duty personnel, and demobilized in response to a national emergency. As you know, Mr. President, South Dakota National Guard participated in that impressive effort. 
The National Guard's effectiveness further proved itself in the natural disasters of the past few years. Our state is indebted to the National Guard for its stellar performance in the recent past in helping communities deal with crises ranging from flood waters to snow drifts. 
I join all South Dakotans in wishing our troops from Ellsworth Air Force Base and the South Dakota Air National Guard a safe and successful completion of their mission as they protect our interests overseas.

Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise to fully join in the strong bipartisan support for the nomination of Dr. David Satcher, as expressed on the Senate floor today, for the dual position of U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health. 
This Nation is fortunate that a man of Dr. Satcher's dedication, vision and deep commitment to public service has agreed, in fact, to take on this critically important role, a critical role, I might add, that has been unfilled--unfilled--since 1994. It is time to fill this critical position. We have gone more than 3 years without a Surgeon General to push Americans toward better health and healthier lifestyles. 
Dr. Satcher has served the American people as a family practice physician, as an educator and as an established leader in the public health arena. During his tenure as the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Satcher worked to strengthen the critical prevention link in our Nation's public health structure. He tackled the problem of lagging childhood immunization rates, increasing the number of kids immunized by nearly 25 percent. Rates increased from 55 percent in 1992 to 78 percent in 1996. This is an exceptional accomplishment. 
Under Dr. Satcher's leadership, we reduced by one-fourth the number of children at risk for immunization-preventable diseases, some of them permanently disabling, or even fatal. 
Dr. Satcher also spearheaded a highly successful program to provide breast and cervical cancer screening to women throughout America. State participation in the CDC breast and cervical cancer screening program increased from 18 to 50 percent. 
He helped launch an early warning system to detect and prevent foodborne illnesses, such as E. coli. This system was instrumental in tracking and containing salmonella, E. coli and cyclospora, in imported raspberries, outbreaks. 
Dr. Satcher has wide-ranging support. He is clearly of the political, of the medical mainstream in our Nation. He is endorsed by 133 organizations, including the American Medical Association and many physicians groups, the American Hospital Association and most hospital organizations, the American Nurses Association and many others, including prominent pharmaceutical companies. 
Dr. Satcher has indicated very clearly to this Senate that he sees his role as providing a focus on issues that unite Americans and not divide them; that he wants to strongly promote a message of abstinence and responsibility to our youth. 
In a recent letter Dr. Satcher wrote: 
If I'm confirmed by the Senate, I will work to ensure that every child has a healthy start in life. I will encourage the American people to adopt healthy lifestyles, including physical activity and diet, and I will try to help the American people make sense of a changing health care system so that they can maximize their access to and the quality of the health care they receive. 
I believe, Madam President, that Dr. Satcher's goals are squarely on target. Our Nation will be well served by a public health leader who could help us foster healthy lifestyles, a consumer advocate who recognizes that strengthening our health care system means empowering individuals to make informed decisions of their own about the care that they receive. I am confident that Dr. Satcher, a man of experience, proven integrity and great insight will help us make these goals a reality. I am confident that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in confirming this important nomination. I yield back my time. 
Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Bullet Proof Vest Partnership Act of 1998 introduced by Senator Leahy and Senator Campbell. I am an original cosponsor of this legislation and I want to take this opportunity to commend my colleagues for their work in addressing this issue. This bill is about saving lives and protecting the men and women in law enforcement who keep our communities safe. There are few opportunities for the Congress to help local law enforcement, and I thank Senators Leahy and Campbell for bringing this grant program to the attention of the Senate. 
The Bullet Proof Vest Partnership Act will establish a $25 million matching grant program within the Department of Justice to help state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies purchase needed body armor. According to the Department of Justice, approximately 150,000 state and local law enforcement officers, nearly 25 percent, are not issued body armor. Justice estimates that the risk of fatality for officers while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers equipped with protection on the job. 
While law enforcement in my rural state of South Dakota does not face the volume of high risk and hazardous situations that police forces in New York or California contend with every day, one preventable death is too many, and this program will help every community protect their officers. To that end, Senators Leahy and Campbell were careful to structure this program to guarantee access for rural states and communities. Under the small state minimum in the Leahy-Campbell bill, South Dakota would be eligible for at least $187,000 per year in federal matching grant funds. The bill also gives the Department of Justice the discretion to lower or waive the matching requirement for communities facing financial hardship. Life saving body armor can run $500-700, keeping bullet proof vests out of reach for many small and rural communities with extremely limited resources. 
I also strongly support the recognition of Indian tribal law enforcement needs included in this bill. Juvenile crime and gang activity are on the rise on rural reservations, and resources are continually scarce. This bill will allow tribes to access funds on equal footing with state and local police forces. I am committed to encouraging cooperation between tribal and non-tribal law enforcement agencies in my state and throughout the country for the important and shared goal of combating crime nationwide. Recognizing tribal law enforcement through this grant program is an important step forward. 
Mr. President, the need to protect our law enforcement officers is pressing. This legislation will outfit our law enforcement officers with the equipment necessary to protect themselves while protecting our families. I encourage speedy Judiciary Committee consideration of this initiative and urge full Senate support for this much needed grant program.

Mr. JOHNSON. I wonder if it isn't fair to say--there has been some harsh rhetoric here and knocking down of straw men as we have gone about discussions this afternoon in the United States Senate relative to memorializing former President Reagan. And I wonder if it isn't fair to say that the issues that have been raised are not questioning whether to suitably and appropriately memorialize President Reagan's administration. The questions are not partisan in nature. We have memorialized Presidents of both political parties, as we always will and always should. There is no opposition, certainly, to the largest building I believe on all of Pennsylvania Avenue, America's main street, the avenue that is used for our inaugural parades, the largest building, a very prominently located building--and it has yet even to have the ceremony for its opening, but it passed by unanimous vote, the Senator tells us, in both the House and Senate; bipartisan on both sides of the aisle--but there was no resistance to memorializing in a very prominent and very focal, high focal point of our Nation's most important street an enormous building named for President Reagan. 
So it would seem that the issues that have been raised here are not petty, are not meant to demean or in any way undermine the recognition of the contributions that President Reagan made--and he made very significant contributions to this Nation--but that there are legitimate points being raised, one, about the process, rather than the politics, of naming and especially renaming where the name George Washington has always been tied to National Airport--in fact National Airport, I believe, was designed with the terminal intended to be evocative of Mount Vernon and located in a community very near Mount Vernon and where he is very closely associated with the Arlington and Alexandria communities--and whether there ought to be a more systematic process for especially renaming institutions that have been previously named for other great Americans.

Mr. JOHNSON. Obviously, I do not speak for my colleagues on either side of the aisle. I speak only as this Senator, expressing, one, my conviction that there ought to be a very significant memorial to Ronald Reagan. There is one that has been built. The doors, the ribbons have not yet been cut. They soon will be. And this is an extraordinary memorial in one of the most prominent locations of all of Washington. I applaud that. 
The only other question I raise is whether there ought to be yet another memorial before the ribbon has even been cut on the first large one, which would have an effect on the airport that memorialized George Washington and which has not gone through what seems to me, from this Senator's point of view, an orderly, thoughtful process. 
The Board of Trade in the Washington area, other groups think this is a poor idea, that perhaps there ought to be other memorials to Ronald Reagan. I would say probably that is true. 
The suggestion is there ought to be one in every State. Perhaps there ought to be. Perhaps there ought to be more in Washington, DC. 
However, I simply raise as this Senator's point of view that I think we are getting carried away in a nonsystematic and not terribly thoughtful process about how we name and pull names off of memorials to great Americans. So I have nothing but great respect to express for President Reagan and his family, and I regret that any of this debate that has been caught up in exactly how best to memorialize great Americans would by anyone be perceived as somehow negative or otherwise undermining respect for this past President. 
However, I think there are legitimate concerns expressed by some that have nothing to do with partisan politics, that have nothing to do with respect or lack of respect for past Presidents, particularly this past President. I simply want to raise that issue, that there are concerns among those who I think in good faith are expressing some concern not about memorialization but about a specific renaming. The issue, I think, in that sense is narrow. 
I personally feel that there is room for improvement in the process that we use for the naming of institutions. That isn't to say, however, that the naming of any particular institution wouldn't be approved by what I think ought to be a nonpartisan commission of some sort, which I think would greatly strengthen our current rather hodgepodge way of naming institutions and buildings and facilities that will be that way for hundreds of years--unless, of course, there are changes in power in Congress and we develop this precedent that whoever is in the majority comes in and changes the names of buildings. That would be a terrible mistake. 
I hope the Reagan building downtown stays that way virtually forever and that there is never a thought of renaming that. I simply raise this point to hopefully lend a bit of thoughtfulness and recognition that at stake here is not the honor of the Reagan family or President Reagan nor is it necessarily partisan politics. 
I do not necessarily join in with others who may see other political agendas here. This is an institution of 100 individuals, and there are probably 100 agendas on this floor on a given day, but I do want to share those observations with my friend and my colleague about the concerns that came to my mind on this issue.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to recognize an extraordinary group of young athletes from my alma mater, the University of South Dakota. The University of South Dakota Men's Cross Country Team recently won the 1997 NCAA Division II Men's Cross Country Championship held on Saturday, November 22, 1997 in Kenosha, Wisconsin. This victory was accomplished against a talented nation-wide field of competition and was the second national athletic championship ever won by USD athletes. 
All the time, effort, and dedication these talented student athletes put into this winning season reaped great rewards for the team and USD. This honor is a result of a great team effort along with individual commitment, talent, and perseverance. 
I would also like to commend head coach Scott Munsen for providing outstanding leadership to the USD men's cross country team during the last four years. 
The State of South Dakota has much to be proud of. I want to again congratulate all of our fine young athletes and the University of South Dakota on this great accomplishment.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Children's Inn of Sioux Falls, SD, and to pay tribute to two women, Connie Kolbrek and Marlene Weires, whose dedicated service has enlightened the lives of many South Dakota women and children. 
This fall, the Children's Inn is celebrating its 20th anniversary of providing emergency outreach services to women and children in the greater Sioux Falls community. When the Children's Inn first opened its doors in an unfurnished two-bedroom bungalow, its primary directive was to provide emergency shelter for children who are victims of abuse and neglect. Staff members realized that an unsafe environment for children was also unsafe for adult victims of abuse, and the inn extended its outreach to all victims of domestic violence. Shortly thereafter, it became apparent that the inn's services were in high demand, and the inn moved to larger facilities and expanded its staff. Currently, the inn serves as many as 3,000 people annually and employs 39 staffers. While the inn continues to function under its founding purpose, it has expanded its services to include a crisis phone line, drop-in counseling, support groups for women and children, parenting classes, and classes for abusers. 
Mr. President, the Children's Inn clearly has filled a significant void in the lives of many Sioux Falls women and children, and the 20th anniversary is a true milestone. However, none of its success would be realized today if it were not for the tireless work of Connie Kolbrek and Marlene Weires. Connie served as the first executive director from 1977 to 1984. Her dedication and commitment to children helped to transform the inn from a simple idea on paper to a mainstay in the Sioux Falls nonprofit community. Marlene has served as the inn's executive director from 1985 until present, and her selfless service has produced many of the extension services which are available to the public today. Although Marlene is planning her retirement, I am confident that she will maintain her peripheral support. The Children's Inn and the women and children of Sioux Falls were blessed with her many years of service. 
Again, I applaud the Children's Inn on its 20th anniversary, and recognize the selfless work of the staff. Mr. President, I yield the floor today, knowing that the Children's Inn is a beacon of hope for many victims of abuse and neglect.

Mr. JOHNSON. I was extremely pleased that recently President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton hosted a White House Conference on Child Care. The conference was not only informative, but also very effective, I believe, in drawing nationwide attention to the widespread difficulties that most parents have in finding child care that is both affordable and of high quality. 
It is estimated that each and every day 3 million children under the age of 6 will spend time being cared for by someone other than their parents, including one-half of all babies younger than 12 months of age. We all know that these early years are critical years for child development and that we need to be concerned about the quality of care that these children are receiving. Unfortunately, for too many children, the quality is simply not high enough. 
One national study, which was published in 1994, rated the majority of child care centers as mediocre or poor. 
One out of eight child care centers were found to actually jeopardize children's safety and development. Not surprisingly, Mr. President, children in substandard care have delayed language and reading skills, they are more aggressive than other children their age, and we should, therefore, recognize that raising the quality of care has long-term benefits not only for these kids but for our society as a whole. Clearly, strong families and strong parenting comes first, but we need to complement that with a greater emphasis on quality, affordable child care. 
We understand and we recognize that child care can be extremely expensive, costing thousands of dollars per year for each child, and over $8,000 a year in some parts of our country. Many parents struggle with paying these bills, which are frequently larger than their rent, mortgage, or car payment. In the case of middle- and lower-income families--especially single-parent families--child care costs can easily consume more than one-quarter of a family's annual income. 
I have been holding a series of meetings with child care providers in my State of South Dakota. We face some special challenges in our State. Among these challenges is the fact that we have the highest percentage of working mothers in America. For more than 70 percent of the children in South Dakota, both parents work; or in the case of a single-parent family, the sole parent works. 
Another item discussed at these meetings was the negative impact of cuts in the child and adult care food program that were part of the Welfare Reform Act of 1996. Many child care providers have relied on this assistance to provide affordable care, and many families now face increasing costs and reduced access to child care. One of the consequences of the change in the nutrition program was to actually create a disincentive for child care providers to remain licensed and certified. 
Mr. President, I believe that the evidence is abundantly clear that we need to do more to provide more affordable and higher quality child care. This can be accomplished, I believe, without the creation of some new bureaucracy. Instead, working in partnership with the States, local governments, and nonprofit organizations, the Federal Government, working in Federal-State-local and a public-private partnership can achieve a great deal. 
In an effort to seek constructive solutions, I have recently cosponsored two bills, the CIDCARE Act and the Early Childhood Development Act. These bills would work together in a complementary fashion. 
I would like to congratulate Senators Jeffords and Dodd for their efforts in authoring the CIDCARE Act, S. 1037. I am pleased to join them as a cosponsor. The bill contains several provisions that would be a very positive step forward for all forms of child care. 
First, the bill would refocus the existing child and dependent care tax credit by making it refundable for low-income families and by increasing the credit for families with incomes under $55,000. These steps will provide much-needed assistance to families with the costs of whichever kind of quality care they choose. 
Second, the bill contains a number of provisions to encourage child care providers to offer higher quality care by boosting training levels. Child care providers would be eligible for more generous tax deductions for education and training that helps them receive professional credentials. Additionally, States would receive grant funding to operate training programs and to offer scholarships to providers who receive training. 
One aspect of the child care quality problem is the extremely high turnover among child care workers, which is not surprising when one realizes that most child care center workers make barely more than the minimum wage. The CIDCARE Act approaches this problem in creative ways. 
First, the bill would create a problem for student loan forgiveness of child care workers who earn degrees in early childhood education, or who receive professional care credentials. Additionally, grant money would be made available to the States under this bill, which could be used for programs to provide salary increases for providers, who receive professional credentials. 
We should do all we can to encourage more private sector businesses to offer child care benefits. The CIDCARE Act would provide tax credits to employers to reduce the costs of starting up a child care center, for the professional development expenses of child care staff, and for cost also related to getting a child care facility accredited. 
All in all, the CIDCARE Act contains a number of innovative nonbureaucratic provisions, and I believe it would be a great step forward in increasing child care quality and in making it more affordable. 
The second piece of legislation that I have cosponsored is the Early Childhood Development Act, S. 1309. I became an original cosponsor of this legislation when it was introduced just 2 weeks ago. I congratulate Senator John Kerry and 
Senator Bond for their work on this bill. 
One of the more critical needs in my State of South Dakota is for after-school programs. More than half the school-age children in my State have no parent at home in the hours after school lets out. From nationwide statistics, we know that juvenile crime is at its highest between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., the hours between when kids get out of school and before parents, all too often, get home from work. 
The Early Childhood Development Act contains provisions to expand Federal financial assistance to innovative programs that target at-risk children by providing constructive activities and care after school lets out. The bill does not create some new Federal bureaucracy. Instead, it offers grant money to States who will, in turn, make grants to local after-school programs that are typically run by nonprofit organizations, such as the Boys and Girls Clubs. We need more of these after-school programs, and we need more resources to expand the number of children that these programs can reach. 
The Early Childhood Development Act would also strengthen programs that offer care to our youngest kids, aged 0 to 6. The more we learn about early childhood development, the more we realize how critically important it is that these children receive quality care. This bill would supplement the Federal child care and development block grant for at-risk infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. 
Along the same lines, the bill would increase funding for the new Early Head Start Program, which provides comprehensive child development and family support services to infants and toddlers. This program not only offers a high-quality educational component for young children, but also parent education, parent-child activities, and health services. 
Mr. President, I believe that these two important bills--the CIDCARE Act and the Early Childhood Development Act--will go a long, long way toward addressing the critical child care needs that we have throughout America today. I look forward to working on them in a bipartisan fashion during this next session of the 105th Congress. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome home the men and women of the 452d Ordnance Company, an Army Reserve Unit based in Aberdeen, SD, and congratulate them on successfully completing their recent mission to Hungary in support of Bosnian peacekeeping efforts. 
The 452d is one of only six direct support ordnance units in the entire U.S. Army. The 452d is also a tier 2A high priority unit, which means that the members of this unit are well-trained, have adequate manpower, and have a high level of readiness. The men and women of the 452d pride themselves on their ability to quickly and effectively mobilize when their country calls upon them. 
The 452d has an impressive history of serving the Nation. The 452d Ordnance Company was the first unit in the 6th Army to be deployed during Operation Desert Storm. The members performed extremely well during this mobilization and received the Meritorious Unit Commendation from the Secretary of the Army for their outstanding service. As you know, Mr. President, this is an extremely prestigious award with only a handful of National Guard and Reserve units having ever received it. Furthermore, the 452d was recently inspected and found to be performing at such an outstanding level that the unit is being recommended for the Meritorious Unit Commendation once again. Most units would be honored to simply be nominated for this award, and it is truly a sign of the 452d's excellence that it may receive the award twice. 
In addition to helping lead coalition forces to victory in the Middle East, the 452d brought relief to many in their hometown of Aberdeen, SD, by aiding emergency management efforts in recent winter storms and flooding. The 452d is a shining example of how reserve units across the country are being called upon more frequently to serve their country both at home and abroad. 
The men and women of the 452d began their most recent, and perhaps most demanding, mission in March of this year when 83 members of the unit were mobilized for duty in Europe. For the past 8 months, these individuals were stationed at Taszar Air Base, Hungary, supporting peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia. Unit members were rotated into Bosnia from time to time, venturing inside one of the most politically volatile areas in the world. 
Of course, the soldiers who were mobilized were not the only ones who sacrificed in service to their country. The families of these servicemembers also exhibited extreme courage in facing new challenges and additional responsibilities in the absence of their loved ones. To help with that transition, the 452d Family Support Group provided guidance, assistance, and support. In fact, during the Persian Gulf conflict, the 452d Family Support Group received the Best Small Unit Family Outreach Program Award from the 96th Army Reserve Command. The 452d Family Support Group met every Wednesday to discuss the ways in which they could best support family members of the mobilized soldiers. On Saturdays, they frequently showed videos of the mobilized soldiers stationed in Hungary and provided access to e-mail for communication between soldiers and their family members. 
Each and every family member deserves recognition, but at the risk of leaving someone out, I would like to mention the following officers of the 452d Family Support Group: Sandy Robinson, South Dakota Reserve Family Support leader; Ronnie Evenson, unit leader; Becky Parker, group leader; Lois Beckner, group leader; Mary Ewalt, group leader; and Donna Schulte, assistant group leader. 
I would also like to mention the important service provided by the unit members who were not mobilized, but who remained in South Dakota and provided the ever-important moral support 
to their colleagues serving overseas. These individuals, including mechanics, administrative personnel, and others, continue to ensure that the unit is ready to serve their nation at a moment's notice. 
It is also important to recognize those employers who stood by their employees called upon to serve their nation. The commitment of employers like these allow our country to rely so heavily on its reserve and guard forces. 
It is with much relief and pride that I join the family members of the 452d and all South Dakotans in welcoming the following troops safely home from their mission. It is from this service that the 452d has formed a strong bond with the community of Aberdeen and the State of South Dakota, and I thank them for their service.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Meals for Achievement Act. This bill, if enacted, is intended to expand the school breakfast program in elementary schools. 
In his State of the Union address earlier this year, President Clinton called education `my number one priority for the next four years.' Congress has echoed this sentiment with a variety of bills intended to improve the readiness of children to take their place in America's work force in order to secure our place in a strong economy. For the United States to compete effectively in the world we must have an educated and productive work force. In order to have an educated and productive work force, we must prepare our children to learn. In order to prepare our children to learn they must be well nourished, and that begins with a good breakfast. 
The best teachers in the world, with the best standards, cannot teach a hungry child. A child who begins his or her school day with their stomach growling because they either did not have time to eat breakfast or there was no breakfast to be served, is simply too distracted to focus on the lessons being provided by the teacher. 
In 1994, the Minnesota Legislature directed the Minnesota Department of Children, Families and Learning to implement a universal breakfast pilot program integrating breakfast into the education schedule for all students. The evaluation of the pilot project, performed by the Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement at the University of Minnesota, shows that when all students are involved in school breakfast there is a general increase in learning and achievement. 
Researchers at Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital recently completed a study on the results of universal free breakfast at one public school in Philadelphia and two in Baltimore. The study, to be published in the Journal of Pediatrics in the near future, found that students who ate the breakfast showed great improvement in math grades, attendance, and punctuality. The researchers also observed that students displayed fewer signs of depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, and other behavioral problems. 
As reported by the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project [CCHIP], hungry children are more likely to be ill and absent from school and are less likely to interact with other people or explore or learn from their surroundings. This interferes with their ability to learn from a very early age. School-aged children who are hungry cannot concentrate or do as well as others on the tasks they need to perform to learn the basics. Research indicates that low-income children who participate in the School Breakfast Program show an improvement in standardized test scores and a decrease in tardiness and absenteeism compared to low-income students who do not eat breakfast at school. 
According to the Tufts University Center on Hunger, Poverty, and Nutrition Policy, evidence from recent research about child nutrition shows that, in addition to having a detrimental effect on the cognitive development of children, undernutrition results in lost knowledge, brainpower, and productivity for the Nation. 
If we are serious about improving productivity in America through our education system, we must first prepare our children to learn. The time has come, therefore, to build upon the pilot program in Minnesota, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and other cities, and integrate school breakfast into the education day, at least at the elementary school level. 
Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today would not mandate the school breakfast program. A local school could still decide whether or not to participate, and each parent can decide for themselves whether or not to have their child participate. 
I do appreciate that there is a cost involved with this initiative and, therefore, we may have to phase it in over a few years. However, the time has come to set the course for our future direction in the School Breakfast Program and take our first step forward. 
The Meals for Achievement Act raises an important policy question. The question is: What is the basic purpose and goal of the School Breakfast Program? Is the School Breakfast Program a welfare program? Or, Is the School Breakfast Program a nutrition and education program intended to prepare children for a successful educational experience? If the School Breakfast Program is a welfare program then my legislation would not make sense. I do not believe that we should be providing welfare to individuals who do not need assistance. If, on the other hand, the School Breakfast Program is a part of the education day, and is intended to prepare children to learn, then, in my opinion, it should include all children. School books are provided to all children without regard to their income; school buses are used by children without regard to their income; and that is how we should view the School Breakfast Program. 
I commend this legislation to my colleagues and to the administration. As many of you know the child nutrition programs must be reauthorized in 1998 and the Administration is currently drafting its proposal to send to Congress after the first of the year. I would hope Secretary Glickman and my friends at the Department of Agriculture, as well as those at the Office of Management and Budget, consider making the Meals for Achievement Act a part of their legislative initiative.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee and thank him for his leadership on this extraordinarily important issue for our Nation. 
I rise in support of the motion to proceed on fast-track negotiating authority, and I rise as one who as a Member of the other body cast a vote `no' on NAFTA and `yes' on GATT, and one who appreciates that the judgment on the final merits of negotiated trade agreements is something that comes next; that what we have at hand here is a critical procedural issue about whether in fact this administration, as past administrations, will have the authority to go forward to at least be at the table on trade arrangements. 
So I am very mindful that today we are talking about process and not a final trade agreement, and that all of us as Members of this Senate will reserve our judgment on the merits of whatever negotiated agreement comes back to us for our ratification. 
The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1997 simply provides the same basic structure and authority for this President as has been provided for past Presidents of both political parties back to President Ford. And if anything, this act strengthens the hand of Congress. It provides for more notification, more consultation, and in fact explicitly restricts Presidential authority in areas not specified in the act. The ability to negotiate under fast track has in fact expired with the approval of the Uruguay round of 1994, and we find ourselves now with great urgency having to deal with this procedural issue. 
I think we need to understand, Mr. President, that we go forward or backward on trade. There is no such thing as the status quo. We live in a nation that historically has had very few restrictions on the import of products into our Nation. Most of the trade barriers that need to be dealt with in this world are barriers to the export of our goods abroad. If the United States does not lead on trade, the harsh reality is that others will displace our role with arrangements of their own that may very likely be harmful to the American economy, to American workers, to American jobs, and certainly to American agriculture. 
Even in this hemisphere there are others who seek to displace the American leadership role. The European Union currently is attempting to negotiate trade agreements with leading South American nations by 1990, claiming that their future is with Europe rather than with the United States. Other bilateral, other regional arrangements are in the process of being negotiated. All of this goes forward with the United States on the sideline unless we extend this authority to the President because it is only by being engaged in international trade that we can expect to lead toward not only our economic prosperity but democracy, security, and improvement of the environment, dealing with drugs, dealing with terrorism, dealing with weapons of mass destruction. 
The United States cannot be a leader for human rights but neglect its role on trade. I think it is important for the Members of this body to recognize that what we have before us is not a referendum on NAFTA. It is not a referendum on any previous trade agreement. It is, in fact, an acknowledgement that we live, however, in an interglobal economy, that we live in that reality, and that reality requires us to become involved in engagement and in a leadership role. Cowering behind walls of fear about trade does a disservice to us all, including workers, the environment and human rights. 
The United States represents only 4 percent of the world's population but 21 percent of the world's gross domestic product. It ought to be obvious to us all how critically important trade is to the United States. 
In my home State of South Dakota, 1 of every 3 acres of land throughout the State planted to crops is in effect planted for the export market. We simply cannot allow other nations to forge regional and bilateral trade arrangements without the United States even being at the table. And that is the question, that is the fundamental question before this Senate: will we bring the United States to the table to be a player, to be a leader, or will the United States cower on the sidelines and allow other nations to go forward with arrangements that may or may not be beneficial to American workers and the American economy? 
Fast track is not about a particular trade agreement. It is not about politics, although there are, admittedly, some in the other body who would tie this agreement to collateral, unrelated issues involving international family planning or even antipublic school agendas, and so on. Hopefully, this will not be brought down by those kinds of irrelevant side issues. We should not be involved in ideology. What in fact we have here is an issue that is about jobs, about economic growth, about world competitiveness. 
Other nations simply will not put forth their best offers at the table with our trade representatives if they know they will then have to renegotiate the entire matter with coalitions of Members of Congress and unending domestic political turmoil in our own Nation. 
Trade is critically important to my own State of South Dakota. Its export trade has increased from $700 million to $1.2 billion in the past 5 years. Demand continues to grow. But, in fact, so does competition from suppliers, and the need for fair trade and fair access continues to be great. I am pleased with the administration's agricultural initiatives. I am pleased with their support for S. 219, of which I am a cosponsor, the Value Added Agricultural Products Market Access Act of 1997, which would allow for the U.S. Trade Representative on a annual basis to identify nations that deny market access for value added U.S. agricultural products or that apply standards for import from the United States not related to protecting human, animal, or plant life or health and not based on science. 
Our red meat exports are now at a record level of $2.4 billion. I am pleased that the administration has directed the Secretary of Agriculture to improve the availability of livestock import data, and the Secretary of Agriculture, in cooperation with the livestock industry, to work on guidelines for voluntary labeling of meat and meat food products. 
Agricultural exports nationally have grown 50 percent from 1990 to 1996, from $40 billion to a now record $60 billion. And in the current environment where we no longer have a farm price support system in place, it is all the more important that every possible tool be brought to bear to expand farm income, farm prices, and the competitiveness of one of America's great economic sectors. 
I am pleased that agriculture will, in fact, be an explicit goal of the President's negotiating authority. 
So again, Mr. President, this is not a referendum on past trade agreements, but it is a referendum on whether the United States will continue to be a leader or even a participant in international trade or whether we will succumb to fear, whether we will in fact enter the 21st century in retreat rather than as the global leader in economic issues, which this Nation deserves and which this Nation needs. 
I yield back my time to the distinguished chairman.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the conference report on the fiscal year 1998 appropriations for VA, HUD and related agencies. While this bill continues to focus on the commitments this Nation has made to our veterans, and provides for the important scientific and environmental protection priorities that the administration has put forth, I want to take a moment to express my support for the steps the conferees have taken to address a serious and pressing issue facing low income housing assistance in this country. 
Since its inception, the HUD section 8 housing program has provided rental assistance for low-income individuals through project-based contracts as well as vouchers which help to preserve low income housing availability. This conference report not only includes funding for the renewal of section 8 contracts, but contains the extremely important mark-to-market contract restructuring program which, beginning in 1999, will preserve affordable housing for millions of low-income tenants while saving the taxpayers billions over time as well. I want to commend my Banking Committee colleagues, particularly Senator Mack who authored the initial section 8 restructuring bill, for their tireless efforts to insure that this restructuring program was accepted. 
Nationwide, section 8 contracts covering 1.8 million assisted units are expected to expire in fiscal year 1998. The mark-to-market program is a mortgage and rent restructuring program to reduce the costs of over-subsidized section 8 multifamily housing properties insured through the FHA. Under this restructuring program, FHA insured properties with above market rents are eligible for debt restructuring to bring the rent levels in line with market rate rent levels, or the project-based rents needed to support operation and maintenance of the housing facilities. The bill directs the HUD Secretary to work with State and local housing entities to reduce expiring section 8 contract costs, address troubled projects, and correct management and ownership deficiencies. 
Because Congress has been unsuccessful in past attempts to move the type of section 8 overhaul necessary for the preservation of low-income housing assistance in this climate of budget cuts, HUD has been renewing all longer term expiring Section 8 contracts with quick-fix, 1-year contracts. The short-term renewals have led to confusion and fear among recipients of housing assistance in my State and across the country. 
Many assisted housing residents in South Dakota have been worried for several months as to whether they will continue to have a roof over their heads in the coming year. As these residents received notice of expiring short-term and long-term section 8 contracts, families were concerned they would be forced from their homes. Some of these families have spent half their lives in these homes. Many of these residents are senior citizens. Many are widows and widowers. Many are disabled. These residents were told that unless Congress acted, they may be forced from their two-, three-, and four-bedroom homes or one- and- two-bedroom apartments and displaced into smaller sized units or homes. 
For many residents in communities such as Northgate Community Homes and Lakota Homes in western South Dakota, this is not an option. Housing at every level of affordability is extremely scarce in my rural State. After raising families in these homes, senior citizen couples living in two- or three-bedroom homes have been told that they would have to downsize to one-bedroom homes. However, at the Northgate and Lakota developments, there are no one bedroom options. Thus these individuals and families have feared displacement into the surrounding area, 
with great uncertainty about their futures. I have been informed by city officials that the low-income housing stock currently available is inadequate to absorb the extra burden of these individuals and families forced from their section 8-subsidized homes and complexes. 
Already, many elderly and disabled couples and individuals have left the developments over uncertainty about their homes. They are leaving behind years of improvements they made in their homes, as well as the cherished memories of raising families in these communities. They have been forced out because of confusion and expiring contracts. 
People like Hazel Holmes of Sturgis, SD, who raised her family in a small two-bedroom home at Northgate Community Homes have been threatened by uncertainty. Hazel's husband died almost 10 years ago and she has continued to live independently in her home. With the expiring section 8 contract, she became very worried--like her neighbors--that she would be forced to leave her home and the neighbors she cherished. Couples like Ruth and Carl Kittleman and Ralph and Dorothy Iverson have already moved from Northgate due to inaction and confusion over this issue. Others fret on a daily basis about their futures. Seniors like Chuck Alberts have persevered each day with the pressure and stress of having his beloved wife Bev in a nursing home. He should not have the added worry about whether he will be able to stay in his home. 
These are just a few examples of the serious section 8 scare that recipients of low-income housing assistance have faced in my State. I am extremely thankful that throughout consideration of the section 8 restructuring proposal my colleagues took special notice of the unique needs of rural housing contract restructuring. Because of continued pressure from myself and other rural members, the mark-to-market proposal contains language for a more flexible approach to determining market rents in rural communities--communities where market is difficult to determine, where the project in need of contract restructuring might be the only market for hundreds of miles. The broadened definition of market included in this bill will help to insure appropriate restructuring throughout my State. 
In rural South Dakota, the 244 project-based section 8 contracts provide 6113 housing units, primarily for elderly South Dakotans. With full funding up to $8.2 billion provided through the fiscal year 1998 VA HUD bill, 1070 housing units up for renewal in South Dakota in the immediate future will continue to receive section 8 rental assistance. This volume pales in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of section 8 housing units in jeopardy in states like New York and Illinois, and I appreciate my colleagues' continued sensitivity for awareness of the unique needs of rural States. 
Additionally, I commend my colleagues for relying on the qualified existing State housing finance agencies for the administration of contract restructuring, and on local housing entities for management and planning decisions, both subject to the approval of the HUD Secretary. With public input at every level, HUD will be able to reign in excessive subsidies to appropriate levels so that our Federal housing assistance funds go further, and maintain assistance for low-income individuals for the long term. While the majority of current project-based Section 8 will remain available, local communities will be involved in determining whether tenant-based assistance is more practical in certain communities. This freedom at the local level is important, yet I applaud my colleagues for including distinct protection for elderly and disabled project-based assistance, which will eliminate the type of fear and uncertainty that seniors in my state have been subject to in recent years. 
Without the commitment to fund section 8 for the coming year, and the inclusion of the mark-to-market restructuring program, cuts in other programs for the elderly and disabled, and for preserving available low-income housing would be required. By addressing section 8 restructuring and providing adequate funding, this bill reaffirms the Congress' long term commitment to low-income housing assistance. 
HUD and the States have a daunting task ahead, as thousand of projects under contract throughout the country are pending restructuring. In all cases, I am confident that the involvement and participation of local ad State housing interests at every level will protect the public interest, and all affected parties, including tenants, will have a voice in the future of low-income housing assistance. 
Again, I commend my colleagues for including the section 8 restructuring program in the fiscal year 1998 VA, HUD appropriations bill, and I look forward to working toward continued security for low-income housing in the coming years.

Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I am very pleased that the Senate has finally taken up the discussion of the McCain-Feingold campaign reform legislation. 
I very much appreciate the efforts of Senator Daschle in pushing this process forward. His role in demonstrating that all 45 Senate Democrats support the revised version of McCain-Feingold I think was essential. And I hope that it becomes clear to all Americans that with the one additional Republican vote necessary that we will in fact achieve historic reform of the campaign funding system in our Nation. 
But I also want to applaud Senators McCain and Feingold for what has been a tireless effort on their behalf in forging this bipartisan compromise legislation. We have seen many good bills fall by the wayside over the years. But this seems to be one of the best opportunities in recent years to actually achieve real reform. 
That said, I have to express disappointment on my part that this legislation has been stripped down to a more modest level from its original version. In particular, I am disappointed that the system no longer creates a system of voluntary spending limits in the way that the original bill did. I believe that kind of limitation, that kind of restraint that will slow the nuclear arms race of campaign fundraising and spending in the long run, will in fact be essential. 
Madam President, I have been a long-time supporter of campaign reform legislation. My experiences over these past 2 years have made it even more apparent to me that passage of this campaign finance reform legislation is absolutely critical to the health of our democracy. 
There are those who would suggest that any restraint on spending of any kind is somehow a dumbing down of our democracy when in fact the reality is just the opposite. The quality of our democracy, the integrity of our democracy, is not a function of how much money we spend. It is a function of how well the debate is conducted. 
There are those who have legitimate philosophical problems. There are those who simply see the status quo as being supportive of their own current election to the body, and to the House of Representatives. But I think that there are a great many of us here--and I believe a majority, if the opportunity were afforded to us to actually cast a vote on the merits of campaign finance reform--who would actually support this sweeping legislation. 
I personally have just been through one of the longest and, frankly, one of the most expensive per voter Senate campaigns in the history of America. My opponent and I spent a total of $24 for every vote cast. And, if one were to include the money spent by the national party organizations and the various independent groups, total spending would rise to around $29 per vote. All of this money produced one of the longest political campaigns the Nation has ever seen. My opponent began running 
campaign commercials 17 months from the election, then 13 months before the election--an attack ad campaign, one that I had to respond to, although I was not yet even formally an announced candidate in the race. 
That is the kind of campaign negative--vitriolic, long-winded, longstanding--that did nothing to improve the confidence of the American public in our political process, and did nothing to restore confidence that in fact the system reflects their values and their ideals and their values. It was simply a system awash in too much money. 
Put in perspective, in South Dakota, our small State, with statewide television advertising relatively inexpensive, for a race like this, if one were run in a State like California at $29 per vote cast, the cost would be staggering. The equivalent cost in the State of California would be a $250 million Senate campaign. 
Some argue that the money is good for democracy, that the voters will be more educated by this kind of enormous financial overkill. 
Last week, the Washington Post quoted the House Speaker saying that `If you have enough resources on both sides, you can actually communicate rationally.' In his view, the more money spent by candidates the better. 
But I can tell you with utmost certainty, given my own experience, that these arguments are utterly wrong. Voters in fact over recent years have been turned off by campaigns of this duration and of this negative quality because of unending commercials. 
As I speak to South Dakotans in every corner of my State, there is a fervent wish that we could return to the days when campaigning began with great seriousness around Labor Day of the election year--not Labor Day of the year prior. 
The appearance of this amount of money, the appearance of the raising of this amount of money, is one that gives rise to attitudes that the entire system is corrupt, the entire system is unresponsive, and the American public, that there is too much time spent raising the money. 
Madam President, how long is it going to be that Members of this body and Members of the other body vacate their offices daily to go to their private campaign offices in the row houses and the streets off the Hill to make their fundraising phone calls, to do this `dialing for dollars,' as it is referred to around here, trying to raise the amount of money necessary to run one of these campaigns? 
The typical U.S. Senate campaign, if it were raised in an equal level of energy throughout the 6-year term, would require the incumbent to raise $14,000 a week, every week, 52 weeks a year, for 6 years. Madam President, that is not the kind of money that can be raised casually. That is not the kind of money that can be raised with a barbecue in your backyard back home in South Dakota, or whatever State you are in. That is not the kind of money that can be raised in small increments. That requires a concerted, sophisticated, methodical effort. And it is corrupt and demeaning to the service in this body. And it is destroying the public's confidence in the quality of the deliberations that take place here, and in the kind of accountability that this body has. 
As the amount of money rises, what we have seen last year in the last cycle becomes only more so in the future. The amount of money to raise to win a congressional seat has continued to rise astronomically. According to the Federal Election Commission, the typical candidate for an open seat in the House of Representatives raised nearly $600,000--close to double what was required only 4 years ago. The growth in so-called soft money has been even more explosive. Data from the 1996 elections show that the amount of soft money that was raised and spent was more than three times what was spent in 1992, and 11 times more than was spent in 1980. 
It should be so fundamentally absolutely clear that something is wrong--something is terribly wrong with our system of financing elections in this country. 
Campaigns have become in many ways little more than a campaign finance arms race. And the American public has understandably become disenchanted with politics in large part because of this process. 
There are people who suggested that all we need to do is to ban soft money raised by the political parties. Again, a mistake. Banning soft money without addressing the expanding role of independent groups and political campaigns would not go far enough, and it could create a whole new set of problems. We need to redefine the term `soft money' to include all forms of campaign spending that is presently unregulated. 
During the 1996 election cycle when we experienced a flurry of campaign activity by independent organizations and congressional races, independent expenditures accounted for $19 million of spending--most of it targeted to key congressional races. 
An even more pressing problem is the new phenomenon of issue advocacy advertisements. Last year's Supreme Court decision in the Colorado case opened the floodgates for this kind 
kind of activity. 
According to a study by the Annenberg Center at the University of Pennsylvania, one-third of all campaign advertising totaling $150 million came from these so-called issue ads. Just as influential as other ads, they are political ads. They are not subject to the same fundraising regulations as in reporting requirements. Nobody knows where the money comes from. They are utterly unregulated. 
The Annenberg study indicated that issue ads were the most virulently negative ads on the air. Overall, 81 percent of these ads were attack ads. 
We have also seen the last expansion in the political activity by tax-exempt organizations--organizations, in effect, using taxpayer dollars to further a very political agenda on the left and on the right. And 30 tax-exempt groups are not supposed to be engaged in partisan political activity. But the reality has become very apparent to everyone who has even had a casual following of what has transpired over these last 2 years. In particular, banning soft money to political parties without addressing the growing problem of third-party groups would merely cause more money to flow into these unregulated groups. 
One of my fears is, while we may limit spending that flows formally through the campaign structures of the respective candidates and their parties, that the money then as water flowing downhill washes increasingly into even more unregulated and less accountable mechanisms for running the campaigns, and the candidates will find themselves increasingly irrelevant to their own political campaigns, the political themes. And the political attacks and responses will be orchestrated and designed and organized by these so-called tax-exempt groups--groups that are, in fact, using taxpayer dollars in effect to run their partisan independent issue advocacy kinds of campaigns. 
That does a disservice to the political dialog in our Nation. That does a disservice to any hope that we have that political candidates will be accountable to the public for the positions they take. The American public deserves better than that, and that is why we need campaign finance reform and that is why we need a broadened sense of soft money regulation. 
It is not clear whether there are going to be any amendments allowed in the course of this debate. It is certainly my hope there will be. That is the nature of debate in this body. It is what we have done for 200 years on issues of great public significance. And yet we find a parliamentary procedure being used that may, unfortunately, stop amendments, stop debate and cause this whole exercise to come tumbling down. 
But if we have an opportunity for a full, meaningful debate, involving amendments, if we are allowed to offer amendments, I have two I want to pursue. One is an amendment that would deal with the problem of candidates spending their campaign funds for personal use. This is something I think has become out of hand, as reimbursement payments to elected officials are not itemized and there are literally thousand-dollar reimbursements coming back to candidates for their personal use. 
I think we need to clean this up. I think we need to take another step in the right direction to make the American public think that in fact this system is responsive to them, that campaign money is not some additional source of slush fund, not some additional source of personal financial wealth that is available to candidates. 
A recent study by the Gannett News Service last year showed that many candidates have reimbursed themselves thousands upon thousands of dollars from their campaign funds with virtually no explanation of where the money has gone, what it has been used to purchase. I believe the same itemization requirements ought to be applied to candidates as are applied to other areas. 
Second, I believe another matter in cleaning the system up and restoring a greater sense of integrity to the system is campaigns ought to pay the fair market value for use of private aircraft such as the corporate jets that transport Members from one corner of this continent to the other. Currently, candidates simply reimbursing the equivalent of first-class airfare, when in fact the cost of this transportation is often in the tens of thousands of dollars, and again going unrecorded, results in less accountability than I believe we should have. 
We have had a historic first session of the 105th Congress as we come down now to this final month in the sense I think we have dealt responsibly with the Federal budget, the Federal budget deficit, with the design of some tax relief, in placing I think a greater emphasis on education, preserving a commitment to the environment, doing I think some positive things. But this Congress cannot be deemed a success and history will treat this Congress poorly, in my view, if we miss this opportunity now to enact meaningful, significant campaign finance reform, reform that is supported by the nonpartisan reform organizations around the Nation, one that is not designed to tilt the playing field to one political party or the other because, frankly, in past years that has happened from time to time. We need to get away from that and, in fact, to pursue this kind of significant reform that has bipartisan support, that is supported on a very broad basis by the American public and to quit making excuses to the American public about why it could not get done, no more excuses about why the money will continue to mount, no more excuses why there will not be any greater accountability than in the past, about where the money is raised and how it is spent, no more excuses about why these campaigns are taking now years and years rather than months and months to transpire, no more excuses about where the money came from and who, in fact, has their interests best being considered by our legislative bodies in Washington. 
We have that opportunity now. We cannot allow this to escape from us. We have, today and tomorrow, an opportunity to cast a historic vote to get past some of the parliamentary abuses that are attempted to be used here, the poison pill parliamentary efforts, to get past that and to allow each one of us in this body to go home at the end of this session of the 105th Congress and to look our constituents in the eye and say, I voted for or I voted against campaign finance reform on the merits, up or down. Let us be permitted to cast that vote with the full breadth of debate. While I am worried that that may not in fact transpire today or tomorrow, during the remainder of this 105th Congress we have this great opportunity and it is certainly my hope we will not allow it to slip. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the men and women of Ellsworth Air Force Base's 28th Bomb Wing and join them in their celebration of the Air Force's and the bomb wing's 50th anniversary. 
This is a wonderful time to reflect on the remarkable role the U.S. Air Force and the 28th Bomb Wing have played in our national security and to look toward the future at the growing importance air superiority will have in maintaining the peace around the world. These past five decades have provided countless successes and great memories for the men and women who piloted, maintained, and provided oversight to the numerous important missions of the U.S. Air Force. Our country owes all who have served a debt of gratitude. 
The 28th Bomb Wing was born in August 1947 when the Strategic Air Command organized the wing at Rapid City Army Air Field, later renamed Ellsworth Air Force Base, SD. In 1949, the 28th participated in the first of a long line of historical missions when B-29's flew a 90-day show-of force mission during the Soviet blockade of Berlin. At the start of the cold war, the B-29's gave way to B-36 Peacemakers in 1950 as the 28th provided an umbrella of security for NATO countries. 
The crews of the B-36 were dedicated to their missions--primarily reconnaissance and to gather photographic and electronic information. However, according to B-36 crew chief Bill Shoemaker, they did everything from drop haybales to stranded livestock during the terrible winters of 1949 and 1950 for Operation Haylifts; transport Thanksgiving turkeys to soldiers in Greenland; attend the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, and take a member of the royal family on a short flight. The ability to perform any job, and do it well, was the hallmark of the B-36 crew and a trait that has been reflected in the personnel of the 28th throughout the years. 
Senior Master Sgt. Dave Sitch spent 6 of his 26 years of military service at Ellsworth Air Force Base as part of the 28th Bomb Wing--1951-55, 1974-76. `In the days of the '36 and as part of the 28th, that was the closest group I had ever been in. There was a lot of competition among the squadrons, but there was a lot of camaraderie too. We looked out for each other.' 
Jet technology changed the face of aeronautics, and the all-jet B-52 Stratofortress started replacing the Peacemakers in 1957. The 28th Bomb Wing played an important role in the Vietnam war, flying both bombers and tankers for 9 years. Over the next 20 years, Ellsworth Air Force Base became a vital component of our country's defensive strategy as the 28th assumed the bomber role in the Strategic Projection Force. The B-52 mission expanded to include sea reconnaissance, surveillance, and conventional operations from forward bases, and Ellsworth Air Force Base's reach extended to a number of hot spots overseas. 
Don Strachan spent 10 years as a member of the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base. He recalls a time when the B-52's participated in an operation titled Airborne Alert, in which one-third of the entire B-52 fleet was expected to remain airborne at all times between 1957 and 1960. `Some of the wings couldn't handle it, but the 28th filled in. We never failed to meet our commitment. It was like family. We supported everyone extremely well. The esprit de corps was unmatched. There was a great deal of sharing among the crews. People would come in and observe our operations.' 
Strachan and Shoemaker recalled conducting maintenance on planes in desperately cold temperatures. While stationed with the B-36's in Greenland, Shoemaker recalled, `It was so cold, you couldn't do anything. We worked under the lights on ramps. It was so dark all the time.' Strachan said maintenance crews worked in chill factors that were 100 degrees below zero. `Nothing stopped the 28th,' said Strachan. 
Fred Hurst spent six different stints totaling 19 years at Ellsworth Air Force Base as a member of the 28th Bomb Wing. For many years, he served as president of the 28th Bomb Wing Reunion Association and was recently succeeded in the position by Strachan. Hurst spent 30 years of military service, working in maintenance on B-29's, B-36's, and B-52's and retired from military service as a chief master sergeant. He retired last year as a civilian worker and advisor on B-1B operations. Hurst says the 28th Bomb Wing has always been admired for its professionalism and efficiency. `It is a good wing. It's been at the top for so many years as far as performance goes. It has a great safety record. Whenever someone had a problem, everyone and his brother tried to help him.' 
Mike Isaman spent a total of 15 years at Ellsworth Air Force Base over two stints. As a member of the 28th Bomb Wing, Isaman said teamwork was key to the success of any operation, as well as to the success of the Wing and the Base. `We were all friends. Everyone looked out after each other. It was a team. It worked together. They all stood together. We would do anything possible for other crews and squadrons.' 
The Air Force introduced the next generation of bombers, the B-1B Lancer, in 1987, and once again, the 28th took the lead in housing the sleek new bombers. Adding to its already storied combat experience, the wing deployed both tanker and airborne command post aircraft to Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm. Following action in the Persian Gulf, B-1's were taken off alert, and the world began to settle into the post-cold war era. The 28th Bomb Wing, successful in protecting the United States for five decades began the transition from the strategic role to an all-conventional mission. Once again, the 28th shone brightly as the bomb wing successfully participated in the congressionally directed operational readiness assessment known as Dakota Challenge in 1994. The 77th Bomb Squadron was activated at Ellsworth Air Force Base in April 1997, and the 28th Bomb Wing will continue to stand tall as the `Pioneer of Peace for the 21st Century.' 
I strongly support the B-1B program and share the view of the Air Force that the B-1B is the backbone of our bomber force. It deserves this reputation because of the versatility, efficiency, and effectiveness of the craft. To the flight crews as well as the ground support, administrative staff, security personnel, base support, and hospital personnel who served and continue to serve as part of the 28th, I salute and commend your efforts. The active duty members, families, and retirees have forged an unbreakable bond with the communities of Box Elder and Rapid City. 
Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those associated with Ellsworth and the Air Force for their impressive efforts and for their commitment to South Dakota and the United States. I know they have had an illustrious past, and I know they will continue their success in the future. Their missions will continue, although modified to fit the requirements of the post-cold war world, and I have no doubt that they will continue to be the `first to fight with decisive combat airpower that achieves the aims of the combatant commander's campaign' as their mission states. Best wishes for another 50 years of pride and success.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, a B-1 bomber from Ellsworth Air Force Base near Rapid City, SD, crashed last Friday killing all four of the flight crew members. All four men who lost their lives were highly decorated American airmen receiving such awards as the Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal, the Humanitarian Service Medal, the Combat Readiness Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal. 
The four men were Col. Anthony Beat of the 28th Bomb Wing, vice commander. He was from Attica, OH, and is survived by his wife, Delores Ann, and sons, James and Alan. Maj. Clay Culver was the 37th Bomb Squadron assistant operations officer and weapons systems officer. He was from Sulfur, LA, and is survived by his wife, Cynthia, his daughter, Ann, and son, Parker, all of Rapid City. Maj. Kirk Cakerice, the 37th Bomb Squadron assistant operations officer and instructor pilot, was from Eldora, IA, and is survived by his wife, Myra, son, Brett, and daughter, Kendra, all of Rapid City. Capt. Gary Everett was the 37th Bomb Systems weapons systems officer from Brooklyn, NY, and is survived by his parents, Joseph and Dorthy Everett, of Glasgow, KY, and several brothers and sisters and fiance. 
On Monday, over 1,500 friends, peers, colleagues, and family mourned the loss of these four brave men in a memorial service at Ellsworth Air Force Base. At this time of tragedy, thoughts and prayers and the attention of people of the Black Hills region and the State of South Dakota and our Nation are with the families and friends of these four crewmen. 
This tragic incident underscores how quickly lives of even our bravest and most skilled military personnel can be lost. It is important that the legacy of these four men live on as dedicated airmen, proud parents, loving husbands, grateful sons, and honorable men. Our loss reflects the fact that in peacetime, as well as during conflict, the men and women of our military, our friends, 
our spouses, our children, put their lives on the line each and every day to preserve and protect our liberty as Americans. 
Colonel Beat, Major Cakerice, Major Culver, and Captain Everett were decorated veterans and honorable men who approached their military service with extraordinary dedication, commitment, pride, and professionalism. 
In this time of tragedy, we must also acknowledge that our Nation is stronger and our liberties more secure because of the willingness of these patriots to commit their talent, their leadership, and ultimately their lives to the defense of our Nation. 
Colonel Beat, Major Cakerice, Major Culver, and Captain Everett were shining examples of the quality, the expertise and the talents of the men and women who put on the uniforms of our Armed Forces. 
And so again, Mr. President, our prayers are with the families of these four great American airmen. We know that every day of the week others embark on similar training experiences and similar endeavors. Lives are always at risk in times of peace as well as in conflict in order to protect our liberties as Americans, including our ability in this Senate to gather, to debate, to discuss policy issues affecting our Nation. 
So it is in the great effort of these airmen, and others like them in all of our branches of the military, that we owe great gratitude. All people in the State of South Dakota share the grief but also the pride of these families in the great contribution that these airmen have made to our Nation. 
I yield back my time.

Mr. JOHNSON. I thank you for adding that language to the report. While we are delighted that these emergency repairs will be made if identified as a priority, we wish to note that the BIA has determined that the entire Marty facility needs to be replaced because it is no longer economically feasible merely to shore up these very old structures. Senator Daschle and I are delighted that the replacement high school is now being constructed. However, before long the elementary school facilities must also be replaced. I recognize the shortage of Facilities Improvement and Repair funds. Senator Daschle and I would like to work with the committee and the BIA to place the Marty Indian School elementary school on the priority list for future replacement funds when that list is opened up.

Mr. JOHNSON. In addition, the reservation's juvenile detention center is undergoing a much needed, year-long renovation that has required the tribe to find alternative housing for the residents of the facility. The annual cost of placing the up to 20 juveniles the tribe houses per day in alternative facilities will cost at least $400,000. These resources cannot be found within the tribe's existing budget. Absent additional resources, Bureau of Land Affairs [BIA] officials state the tribe will be forced to release some offenders into the community and borrow money in order to incarcerate the most violent offenders.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the National Endowment for Humanities (NEH). While I am aware of the national importance of the NEH, I am particularly supportive of continued federal funding for NEH because of the regular and critical funding my state of South Dakota receives. Grants from NEH are vital to the people of my state in preserving the rich and unique cultural heritage of South Dakota and the surrounding great plains states. 
NEH programs exemplify the type of federal-state-local partnerships that have traditionally fostered a collective dedication to cultural and historic education. The NEH gives state humanities councils the necessary freedoms to meet local education needs. In the last five years, institutions in South Dakota have received roughly $2.7 million from the NEH and the South Dakota Humanities Council for a variety of library programs and exhibits, literary publications, and cultural heritage visitors centers. 
The South Dakota Humanities Council relies on the NEH for 90 percent of its funding. That support goes directly to schools and small communities for projects like `Calamity Jane: The Woman and the Legend' produced by the Deadwood Historic Preservation Commission, and `Lakota: Language, History, and Culture' at the Bonesteel Fairfax School. At the same time, broader educational projects continue the literary legacy of many of this nation's most acclaimed authors and long time South Dakota residents, including Laura Ingalls Wilder, who gave us the `Little House' series, and L. Frank Baum, author of the classic `The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.' This year, South Dakota celebrated Baum's work with the Wizard of Oz Festival in Baum's hometown of Aberdeen. This festival bloomed into a statewide, year-long celebration, including reading programs in public schools, travelling educational programs, and symposiums involving scholarly interpretations of Baum's work at state colleges and universities. This far reaching festival celebrating Frank Baum's literature was made possible through several NEH grants. 
The many NEH-funded heritage fairs and events held throughout my state every year are endorsed by the South Dakota State Arts and Humanities Councils, as well as state and local tourism authorities. Recently, the South Dakota State Humanities Council received one of only two national awards presented at the National Conference of State Humanities Councils for the Oscar Michaux Festival' held in Gregory, SD. These and countless other worthy public education programs will disappear in my rural State, and the creativity behind this type of education programming will be thwarted if efforts to gut or eliminate the NEH continue. 
Although the United States provides far less public support for the humanities than we spend on military bands, the NEH continues to play a critically important role in improving the quality of life in rural areas, such as South Dakota. I will continue to support Federal funding for the humanities because of the NEH's very positive assistance to cultural and historic organizations and schools throughout America.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, we have today an opportunity to discuss and to ultimately vote on, I think, one of the more important issues, both substantively and philosophically, within the Department of the Interior appropriations bill, that having to do with the future of Federal-State-local partnerships that have existed now for some years with the National Endowment for the Arts and funding for the arts in America. 
There are some who would suggest that somehow this is an elitist enterprise that involves large cities in urban areas. Coming from the State of South Dakota, I can assure my colleagues that the NEA and the funding that has gone to my home State of South Dakota has been absolutely critical as seed money for the promotion and the development of artistic efforts that have benefited virtually every school district, virtually every county, and community across my very large and rural State. 
We have, as so many States do, a great deal of artistic talent, commitment to the arts, but we don't have a lot of corporate sponsors, we don't have a lot of philanthropists, we don't have a lot of sources for funding that can create the seed money that we need for the arts to blossom, to bloom in places like South Dakota. 
The function of this funding has been absolutely critical in our State. It has gone to our school and communities, our touring artists, artisan school programs. It has gone for our Arts Corps Program for South Dakota's juvenile correctional facilities in partnership with our Department of Corrections and the South Dakota Arts Council. It has gone for the Indian services to sponsor the Northern Plains tribal art show and market, which has created a whole new environment, a whole new series of opportunities for Northern Plains Native Americans to develop their artistic skills and to market those skills. It has gone for our Youth at Risk Program. It has gone for our Arts in the Classroom Teachers' Conference, and it has created a whole new environment for the arts in our State. 
When I look back at what existed prior to 1965 when the NEA was created, we had people with great artistic talent in the State then, too, but we didn't have the structure to really promote the arts. Now, thanks to the seed money of the NEA over the years, we have in place the South Dakota Arts Council, we have in place the South Dakota Museum Association, the Rural Arts Presenting Program, Dakota Prairie Playhouse, the Black Hills Chamber Music Society for Big Sioux Arts Council. We have literally pages of arts organizations that now exist in every county, in virtually every community of our State that did not exist prior to the creation of the NEA. 
So, Mr. President, I can't emphasize too much the importance of this organization to enhance the quality of life for those who would otherwise not have great opportunities to experience performance art or art of any kind without this. I think we need to keep in mind that the issue here is really a philosophic one and not so much a budget issue. 
There is $100 million involved here for the Nation's entire artistic effort, less, I might add, relative to the budget and that of any other Western industrialized nation on Earth, but that portion of money has gone a long, long ways in our country. And, in fact, to keep this in some sort of perspective, we are going to be debating later on this month a defense appropriations bill where there are those in conference who would like us to purchase nine more B-2 bombers at a cost of $1 billion apiece. Our entire arts program, that goes to every school, every county and every city in our Nation costs one-tenth of one bomber. It costs less than it would cost to maintain this fleet of aircraft that the Pentagon does not even want. 
So this is, relative to the entire budget, a modest effort, less than what other countries devote, but yet crucially, crucially important, not just for large urban areas and large artistic organizations, but for those of us in rural America who find this an absolute lifeline. 
It is certainly my hope that by the time we conclude the debate on the Interior appropriations bill today that we will find our way to insist that there continues to be a strong Federal-local, public-private partnership in the arts that has gone on now for over 30 years and which has been responsible, I think, for an enormous amount of very constructive, positive effort for our children, for the quality of life in our communities, big and small. 
I know that there are several amendments pending. I won't go into detail about each of them, other than to say, again, I certainly ask my colleagues to very carefully review these amendments. It is critical that when the day is done that we continue to have modest but responsible funding for the arts in the United States. I yield the floor.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota soon to be offered. I join Senator Dorgan in commending Chairman Stevens for his work, certainly the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, for his extraordinary leadership over the years on issues of this nature, and I look forward to working with the subcommittee chairman, Senator Gorton, to see what we can do to move this kind of amendment along. 
Mr. President, I represent a State, the State of South Dakota, where we have nine Indian reservations, and where levels of poverty are extraordinary. I have worked very hard over the years both in the House of Representatives prior to my service in the Senate and now in the Senate on a wide range of initiatives designed to try to improve the circumstances of the native American citizens of our Nation, and of our State--water development initiatives and efforts on housing and health care and infrastructure improvements. I think all of them are important. 
I have come to the conclusion after years of struggling and facing what sometimes appeared to me to be almost overwhelming circumstances of poverty, isolation, and difficulty, that if there is one area that deserves particular emphasis it needs to be education, and in this instance higher education for native American citizens of our country. 
There was a time when I was, frankly, a bit skeptical, there was a time when I thought that perhaps we could just better utilize the existing State and other private institutions of higher education throughout our States. And we have made some successful efforts there in our Upward Bound Programs and others that have been of some help. But, frankly, the dropout rate and the lack of success was very high over the years. Now we have 25 tribal colleges serving between 20,000 to 25,000 native American students in 11 States around the country. We have four of them in the State of South Dakota, all of them accredited, all of them providing high-quality educational opportunities not just for native American students but for many non-Indian students as well who live in those extremely rural areas and who need to have this kind of access to educational opportunity. 
We find that 56 percent of the American Indian population in our Nation is age 24 or younger. There is, demographically, a huge number of people of college age and younger; 90 percent of tribal college students qualify for need-based financial aid; 85 percent live in poverty; more than 50 percent are parents; 70 percent of these young people attending tribal colleges are female. 
As I examine what has transpired over these years that we have developed a tribal college system, I see for the first time a whole generation of native Americans who are becoming teachers and nurses and managers and entrepreneurs; who are becoming role models in their communities where none before ever existed in terms of making their way in the larger economic system of our country. We have so many people who have lived all of their lives without an economic opportunity, without jobs being available, without anyone in their family having had the opportunity to work, who have not had the skills to make it in the larger economy of our Nation, and yet now finally we are seeing this forward edge of progress being made among native Americans. It is, more than anything else, because of this opportunity to secure the job skills, the training, the education, the brainpower that is required to succeed in America, that is required to succeed in the global economy in which we live today. 
These colleges have made their way with very modest resources. In fact, even with the President's recommendation, we will spend only about half the dollars per student as is authorized under Federal law and far less than half of what other community colleges 
and other 4-year colleges in America use to educate each student. It is amazing that they have done as well as they have, that they have kept their accreditation, that they have kept the torch of hope alive for so many people and yet they have done it with far less per student than any other college in America. 
The $2 million request that Senator Dorgan has put into his amendment will be divided among 25 colleges, and yet they have gone so far on so little that even this will be a very significant help for them, given the fact that they have now gone 3 years in a row without any upward adjustment in their funding at all, and despite the fact that enrollment numbers have increased significantly, that this really has become the steppingstone for success and is recognized as such in tribe after tribe throughout our country.

Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator. That is always a well received kind of announcement from the subcommittee chairman. 
We find that our tribal colleges are unmatched in retention, in matriculation and job placement of American Indian students; 42 percent of these tribal college students transfer to 4-year institutions. 
As we undertake the welfare reform initiatives at the Federal level and which the States are carrying through, it is all the more reason we need this opportunity, this steppingstone for people to develop the skills to in fact break out of what has been a relentless, an overwhelming cycle of poverty that so many native Americans have been caught up in. But again, it is not just native Americans who benefit from this. 
I think of an instance of Wilma Sachtjen of Burke, SD, a displaced homemaker with a high school diploma. Wilma enrolled in the Sinte Gleska College in Rosebud, SD. A non-Indian, she was able to secure an education because of this program when no other opportunity could possibly have existed for her. She secured a bachelor's degree in human srvices. She has been employed in that field ever since. And so we have not just native Americans but the entire population of our States at many of these colleges, in most cases in remote areas, gaining opportunity. 
The four colleges in South Dakota: the Cheyenne River Community College at Eagle Butte; the Oglala Lakota College at Kyle; the Sinte Gleska University at Rosebud, and Sisseton Wahpeton Community College at Sisseton, have all provided key educational opportunities for the population of our State. Many of our students also attend Sitting Bull College at the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota and many attend the United Tribes Technical College in Bismark as well. 
So these colleges serve regional populations and not simply the tribal membership of their own reservations. So I cannot share with you in stronger terms the importance of continuing these colleges with adequate funding--certainly not extraordinary funding but adequate funding--to make sure that the ladder of opportunity remains in place. This is a newfound opportunity, a newfound ladder, really, that has only been with us for a relatively recent number of years. But I think it is one of the most vital components we could possibly imagine to have if in fact we are going to break the cycle of poverty, create greater self-sufficiency, greater dignity, greater pride and greater opportunity for native American students. 
I simply say, Mr. President, I cannot commend in stronger terms to my colleagues the importance of the passage of the Dorgan amendment and a continuation of a strong tribal college system in America.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I share the Senator's congratulations to Mary and the staff in general who have worked very hard on these and other key issues. 
I think the Senator from North Dakota raises an important point relative to the unique importance of these institutions, given the kinds of circumstances that the students face where there is a great need for extended family, where transportation is difficult to secure, where the extended family is necessary to make education--oftentimes far more than 4 years, oftentimes 5 and 6 and 7 years--for nontraditional students to become a reality. Were it not for these institutions, there simply would not be this level of educational achievement, there would not be these role models being created, there would not be this kind of leadership created in Indian country today. So, again, I have to thank the Senator for his leadership and insights on this issue, and I yield my time.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the South Dakotans associated with the Freeman wastewater treatment plant. The Freeman facility earned a first-place excellence award in a six-State region from the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Freeman earned an exceptional rating for its plant septage management, toxic waste control, collection system maintenance, financial management, automation, and staff training. In addition, a television-based snaking system was used to pinpoint areas in need of repair. The plant staff and town council should be commended for their foresight in planning ahead and making repairs on the city's wastewater system rather than waiting for an emergency. The efforts of these individuals saves the residents of Freeman thousands of dollars in costly future repairs and insures the health and viability of the city's wastewater system. 
While all the residents of Freeman should take pride in this accomplishment, I would like to mention a few individuals including Vince Kribell, chief operator of the Freeman plant, and Duane Walter. Administrative personnel include Chester Sorensen, Dean Sikkink, Steve Waltner, and Michael Schultz, who is also mayor of Freeman. 
The Environmental Protection Agency started the Operations and Maintenance Award in 1986 to recognize publicly owned watewater treatment facilities that demonstrate excellence in their overall operation. The program also heightens public awareness about the importance of efficient wastewater treatment.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to recognize the important work of Mayor Brenda Barger in leading the residents of Watertown, SD, through winter storms and flooding. 
Early this year, residents of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold temperatures. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane cleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead livestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace. As if surviving the severe winter cold was not challenge enough, residents of the Upper Midwest could hardly imagine the extent of damage Mother Nature had yet to inflict with a 500-year flood. 
Record levels on the Big Sioux River and Lake Kampeska forced over 5,000 residents of Watertown, SD, to evacuate their homes and left over one-third of the city without sewer and water for 3 weeks. The headline of the Watertown Public Opinion on April 6 read `Watertown in Peril,' and I will never forget the image of homeowners and neighbors, shrouded in a late-season snow storm, sandbagging against the rising waters of the Big Sioux River and Lake Kampeska. 
Brenda Barger held Watertown together with her strength and direction. Some 6 weeks prior to major flooding which began on April 4, Mayor Barger initiated efforts to try and minimize the impact of the impending disaster. Mayor Barger brought together local and county officials, volunteer agencies including the Red Cross, Salvation Army, and others, to brainstorm and compile resource lists of expected needs including equipment, people, and funds. 
Despite careful planning, on April 5, an unexpected blizzard hit the State, devastating the area. Everything froze, creating further concerns about what was going to happen once the water began flowing again. Mayor Barger camped out in the city's impromptu crisis center around the clock and helped to direct the efforts of a number of local volunteers, prisoners, and National Guard personnel. Mother Nature caused Mayor Barger to make a number of difficult decisions immediately following the April storm, including ordering the evacuation of nearly 5,000 residents, or one-fourth the population, of Watertown and the shutdown of the water treatment plant at Lake Kampeska. In the following days, Mayor Barger secured over 750 port-a-potties and deployed them on the lawns of those families who could return to their homes. Water trucks were brought in to provide people with a fresh water supply, and Mayor Barger oversaw repairs to the water treatment plant which were completed ahead of schedule. 
While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction wrought by this year's floods, I have been heartened to witness first-hand and hear accounts of South Dakotans coming together within their community to protect homes, farms, and entire towns from rising flood waters. Mayor Brenda Barger truly exemplifies the role of a public servant, who, in the face of unimaginable natural destruction, placed the needs of an entire community ahead of personal concern. Now, Mayor Barger is spearheading efforts by Watertown residents to fully repair the damage from this past year and plan for future emergencies. 
Mr. President, there is much more to be done to rebuild and repair impacted communities. Mayor Brenda Barger illustrates how the actions of an individual can bring some relief to the victims of this natural disaster. I ask you to join me in thanking her for her selfless efforts and congratulate her on being recognized during the National Association of Towns and Townships convention in Washington, DC, this week.

Mr. JOHNSON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, I rise to express my support for this legislation. I want to commend Chairman Roth and the ranking member, Senator Moynihan, and Senators Lott and Daschle for their leadership. A great deal of good has come from the bipartisan cooperation put together to produce this legislation. I certainly will vote for it. 
Much has been said by some about the historic nature of this legislation. Perhaps that is true. But I have to say, in following the comments of my colleague from North Dakota about the historic context of how we arrived at this point, that some observation needs to be made that the truly historic legislation that was passed was the 1993 Budget Act. 
President Clinton inherited a hemorrhaging pool of $290 billion of red ink that was projected to grow annually when he came to the White House. His first step was to work with Congress to pass a 5-year budget plan that passed without a single Republican vote. At that time, I served in the other body. I remember the immense political pressure that was brought to bear at that time. I remember the 30-second television spots that followed, accusing every Democratic Member of having cast the deciding vote on something that would be catastrophic. 
What happened? The $290 billion of red ink has now plummeted this year to an estimated $67 billion, perhaps as low as $30 billion. We now have the smallest Federal budget deficit relative to the size of our economy of any Western industrialized nation on Earth. We have a vibrant economy, high employment, low unemployment, low inflation, and we find ourselves now in the midst of a remarkable era. 
This legislation is important legislation, but it will finish what we began in 1993 when we had a $290 billion deficit and brought it down to as low as $30 billion. This will get us from $30 billion to the finish line by the year 2002, 
a good thing to do, a positive thing to do. But the historic step, the politically courageous step, was taken 4 years ago. 
Is this legislation perfect? No. No, it isn't. That is the nature of any legislation, particularly, I suppose, of a piece of legislation that is a product of compromise between very different approaches. I think some of the high-fiving that has gone on around town may be a bit unwarranted. I would say, however, that this bill has been made much better during the course of the debate. The initial legislation, the reconciliation legislation that we dealt with in both the House and the Senate, provided very little tax relief, essentially no tax relief, for families making less than $30,000 per year. There was certainly no child tax credit for these families. 
Now, as I see it, this problem has been corrected, thanks to the leadership, particularly of the President of the United States, but also of Senator Moynihan and Senator Daschle, and others who worked very hard on this. Take a family, for example, with an income of $23,000 per year, perhaps a teacher, a firefighter, a policeman, a farmer, a store clerk, any number of people across our country who get up every morning--they play by the rules, they try to raise their kids with decent values, they try to keep jeans and tennis shoes on their kids, they are doing the right thing, they are not on welfare, they are working hard, oftentimes with two jobs. 
But wages, particularly in my State of South Dakota, are not always what we would like them to be. Farm prices are sometimes low. And these people, who are working their hearts out, oftentimes are living on very modest wages. And that family, with a father, in this case, who is earning $23,000 a year, and mom who is staying home with two kids, under the original bill and under the original Republican plan, would have gotten zero in child tax credit. Under the Clinton plan, they would have gotten $767. 
Well, the dust has now settled, and under the conference committee bill that we are voting on today, that family will get a $675 tax credit, a very useful sum for those families. People can make a car payment, a house payment, they can get their kids started with clothes for school, they can do some positive things. And I think we need to reward work, particularly at a time when we are reforming welfare and essentially ending the guarantee of federal support of families. We need to focus on what more can we do, then, to make work pay. Certainly this improved child tax credit, along with augmenting the funds in this legislation relative to health insurance for kids, is a positive step forward. 
It is true that this bill still has some unevenness to it. I have noticed that a group called Citizens for Tax Justice has an analysis out that indicates that the wealthiest 1 percent of American families will benefit by about a $16,000 tax cut because of this legislation. The average middle-class family will benefit by something less than $200. That isn't the kind of division that I would have made if it were up to me exclusively. 
But nonetheless, I do see the need to balance the budget by 2002, provide some key relief, not only with the child tax credit, but certainly, in the case of education assistance, to provide a $1,500 tax credit for tuition, tax-deductibility of interest on student loans, and to expand Pell grants, not only the numbers who are eligible but also the size of the grants. That is investing in kids, and investing in the brain power of this country. That is really where we must make a commitment if we are going to compete in a global economy, not just now but for generations into the future. 
I see positive things relative to agriculture. My colleague, Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, has gone into much of that. Capital gains relief for small businesses and family farmers will be helpful. There is also estate tax relief. Certainly, there are some targeted kinds of aid for those who have had to liquidate their herds. There is restoration of income averaging. There are a number of provisions that will be of great help. That I have to applaud. 
I am concerned about the backloading of some of the tax reductions which has the potential consequence of making balancing the budget post-2007 more difficult. It would be disastrous for us to have gone through all of this and then find ourselves the year after balancing the budget, or only shortly thereafter, going back into red ink again because of backloaded or phased-in tax cuts that had negative consequences in the outyears. 
That is something we are going to have to be very conscious of in the future. This is not a matter of turning the Federal budget over to automatic pilot and now we are home free. It is going to involve difficult, contentious, but hopefully bipartisan, annual debates about how to maintain equilibrium between our revenue and our expenditures while still using our budget for the correct priorities. 
I think one of the key political issues in America over these last several years has been, how do we balance the budget? There is bipartisan agreement we need to do that. But how, at the same time, do we protect Medicare, do we continue to invest in education and protect the environment? How do we do it in a way that reflects the best of our values and our priorities in this country? Can that be done? 
Some of us remember only a couple years ago when there was a proposal that would have arguably balanced the budget, but it would have decimated Medicare, it would have taken investment away from education, it would have been destructive to the environment, and certainly to rural Americans. Thankfully President Clinton vetoed that legislation. He said we can do better, we can do better with our priorities and still get to a zero deficit. 
Thankfully, this legislation, for all of its warts and all of its shortcomings, does in fact get us that remaining $30 billion to $60 billion that we need to balance the budget, and it expands the number of kids who have access to health insurance. It will be helpful to small businesses and farms. This bill will increase the tax-deductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-employed to 100 percent, something long overdue. And it will, I think, help continue the economic growth that we have seen over these last 5 years where we have had 5 consecutive years now of deficit reduction and economic growth. 
And so, Mr. President, I think that this is a positive piece of legislation. It is the product of bipartisan agreement. Thankfully, the President has used his leverage to make sure that we do in fact live up to these priorities and to bring some common sense back into this bill. The truly historic legislation was that of 1993, but this is important legislation. I support it. 
I voted earlier for the budget portion of reconciliation. I will vote for this tax portion of reconciliation. I am proud of what our colleagues on both the Republican and Democratic sides have been able to do to pull together, to set aside some of the anger and some of the hostility that too often has characterized political debate in this country, and to spend a little less time being Republicans and Democrats and a little more time being Americans. 
I think that is what the American people really want. And they want to see an end result that reflects the best of our cooperative efforts. This legislation does, I think, take us down that road. 
So, Mr. President, while there are things I would have done differently, and while we do need to understand the historic context of how we arrived here, this is good legislation, and I yield the floor expressing my support for this bill.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to express my strong support for the Senate Resolution calling for a National Day of Unity submitted by Senator Boxer. This Resolution is a direct response to the President's call for a national dialog on race, and I applaud the timeliness and the intent of Senator Boxer's efforts. 
The challenges associated with race relations that we have faced as a nation are apparent throughout our collective history. In my rural state, Native Americans are the largest minority, comprising nearly 8% of the population. Spurred by deep-rooted tensions between Native Americans and non-Indians in South Dakota, the late Governor George Mickelson had the foresight to declare 1990 a Year of Reconciliation on race relations. In his communications with me after this declaration, Mickelson wrote, `* * * our successes reached beyond anyone's imagination. I do not suggest we have even scraped the surface of all that we have too, but I do suggest that there is a new awareness among the citizens of South Dakota for a need to reconcile, a need to learn about and understand one another's cultures, and a need to put aside old prejudices.' 
At the request of the Governor, South Dakota's tribal leaders, and the people of South Dakota, I introduced legislation in the House of Representatives in 1992, calling for a National Year of Reconciliation to focus on healing the breach between Native Americans and non-indians nationwide. That legislation was signed into law by President Bush in May of 1992. Native Americans are a significant, culturally unique and often insular racial minority. In order to understand the history and the future of race relations in the U.S., I have long felt that we must understand the position of Native Americans and the scope of this country's oldest race relationships. The 1992 National Year of Reconciliation legislation was dedicated to the type of dialog that President Clinton has asked for in his broader initiative on race. 
Today, the President's Advisory Board on Race Relations has been charged with the enormous task of addressing racial tensions and the impact of race relations on every American. The first meeting of the Race Relations Board held in San Diego, California, indicated that the Board's task is indeed daunting, and that a dialog on race is potentially divisive. It is that very divisiveness which makes the President's initiative so vital. We are all aware that racism and prejudice persist in this country. A national dialog must be encouraged, and an opportunity for full participation by every American of all ethnicities must be provided. 
Senator Boxer's Resolution calls on the Congress to follow the President's lead in expanding the dialog and including every voice. If we are to move forward as a nation, we must address the forces that divide us, not only to recognize these forces honestly for what they are, but to strengthen our determination that such forces can be overcome. The Senate has been given a unique opportunity today to express our full support for the mission of the Race Relations Board, and requests the participation of the entire country. 
Mr. President, this nation's racial problems cannot be solved by a few people, no matter how well-intentioned. That is why I join Senator Boxer today in asking the country to express its dedication to solving those problems by observing a National Day of Unity.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to recognize the important achievements of SD soybean growers in creating new uses for their agricultural products. 
Freeman Coop Oil/Fertilizer in Freeman, SD, recently became the first retail marketer of petroleum to offer SoyGold, a new lubricity additive in premium diesel fuel. SoyGold is a low blend of soybean methyl esters manufactured from 100 percent soybean oil for both on-farm and commercial use. The additive was developed with the use of check-off dollars, which allow farmers to work together to develop new uses for their products. The soybean growers have also worked to test soydiesel for mass transit bus systems, underground mining, and other innovative possibilities. 
SoyGold was developed by Ag Processors, Inc. in Omaha, NE, and will be promoted and marketed throughout seven Midwestern States initially. Bill Pape, the general manager of Freeman Coop Oil/Fertilizer, is the first to offer the product to his customers. Dennis Hardy, the chairman of the South Dakota Soybean Council, worked hard to bring this new product to the market. All of these individuals, and many more, deserve credit for their efforts to make SoyGold a reality. 
SoyGold is an outstanding example of the way that South Dakota's soybean farmers and their various associations can cooperate and communicate to create an exciting new product which will build demand for soybeans. Such products demonstrate the way that farmers are adapting to the changing agricultural marketplace, and I congratulate them on their foresight, their enthusiasm, and, of course, their accomplishment. Moreover, SoyGold is not only good for South Dakota farmers, but it also benefits us all by reducing harmful emissions. 
Mr. President, there are few industries working as hard to create new products and new markets as agriculture. The South Dakota soybean growers whose efforts created SoyGold are to be commended, and I ask you to join me in congratulating them on their success.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my congratulations to Director R. Vincent Crawford and his staff at the VA Medical and Regional Office Center [VAMROC] in Sioux Falls on receiving the Disabled American Veterans' 1997 Large Employer of the Year Award. This award is a testament to VAMROC's continuing efforts to hire disabled veterans, and I am honored that VAMROC's work was recognized by DAV. 
This national award is presented annually by the DAV to a business with more than 200 employees who assertively hire disabled veterans. The center's Vocational Rehabilitation and Counseling Division provides veterans with valuable work experience and training positions, which opens up new employment opportunities within South Dakota's VA medical centers, and with the private sector. The per capita rate of veterans placed in employment by the VAMROC's Vocational Rehabilitation and Counseling Division leads the Veterans Benefits Administration Regional Offices in this category. 
The VAMROC works in conjunction with the local union representing its employees to ensure that disabled veterans will receive consideration for job openings at VAMROC. Recent veterans employment statistics show that of VAMROC's 704 employees, 219 were veterans for a 31-percent employment rate. Of these 219 veterans, 60 were disabled veterans and 163 were Vietnam era veterans. 
Mr. President, I always have felt that veterans in South Dakota are extremely fortunate to have such high quality facilities, doctors, staff, and administrators at our VA hospitals that provide care second to none. VAMROC certainly exemplifies this commitment to our veterans. Our veterans made a commitment to their Nation, trusting that when they needed help, the Nation would honor that commitment. VAMROC's leadership and dedication is an example of how our Nation can best serve the needs of our veterans. Again, I congratulate Director Crawford and his staff at VAMROC on receiving this award of accomplishment, and I thank them for their continued service to South Dakota's veterans.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to recognize the important work of Sioux Valley Hospital nurses, Jean Skonhovd, Stephanie Brockhouse, Leann Prusa, and Tom Berg, in ongoing disaster recovery efforts in South Dakota. 
Early this year, residents of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold temperatures. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane cleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead livestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace. As if surviving the severe winter cold was not challenge enough, residents of the upper Midwest could hardly imagine the extent of damage Mother Nature had yet to inflict with a 500-year flood. Record levels on the Big Sioux River and Lake Kampeska forced over 5,000 residents of Watertown, SD to evacuate their homes and left over one-third of the city without sewer and water for three weeks. The city of Bruce, SD was completely underwater when record low temperatures turned swollen streams into sheets of ice. 
The 50,000 residents of Grand Forks, ND, and 10,000 residents of East Grand Forks, MN, were forced to leave their homes and businesses as the Red River overwhelmed their cities in April. The devastation was astounding; an entire city underwater and a fire that gutted a majority of Grand Forks' downtown. Residents of both cities recently were allowed to return to what is left of their homes, and the long and difficult process of rebuilding shattered lives is just beginning. 
In the midst of this crisis, Jean Skonhovd, Stephanie Brockhouse, Leann Prusa, and Tom Berg scrambled to travel to Grand Forks and help the victims of the disaster. Not thinking of themselves, these nurses from Sioux Valley Hospital rearranged their personal lives to volunteer their expertise to assist others. Their skill and professionalism shone through as they admirably performed their jobs in chaotic circumstances. Their ability to perform emergency services in these trying times deserves our respect and admiration. 
While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction wrought by this year's snowstorms and floods, I have been heartened to witness first-hand and hear accounts of South Dakotans coming together within their community to protect homes, farms, and entire towns from vicious winter weather and rising flood waters. The selfless actions of these nurses from Sioux Valley Hospital illustrate the resolve within South Dakotans to help our neighbors in times of trouble. 
Mr. President, there is much more to be done to rebuild and repair our impacted communities. Jean Skonhovd, Stephanie Brockhouse, Leann Prusa, and Tom Berg of Sioux Valley Hospital illustrate how the actions of a community can bring some relief to the victims of this natural disaster, and I ask you to join me in thanking them for their selfless efforts.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator McCain's amendment to the Revenue Reconciliation Act that would eliminate the tax exemption for ethanol in the year 2000. 
Mr. President, I am proud to stand in opposition of this amendment. Over the past 3 years, we have been deluged with a deliberate misinformation campaign regarding the impact of the domestic ethanol industry. The partial excise tax exemption gasoline marketers receive for blending their fuel with ethanol has been disparagingly labeled corporate welfare. This label patently ignores the important public benefits that result from the production and use of fuel ethanol. I thought I would share some of the relevant facts. 
Ethanol production stimulates the economy in rural America. As a result of progressive policymakers, ethanol is now produced in 53 plants in 19 States. The production of fuel ethanol results in more than 55,000 high-wage jobs, generates greater than $2.1 billion in household income, and adds more than $7.2 billion to the economy every year. Farmers will receive an additional $2.2 billion each year because of ethanol production. Moreover, nearly all new expansion in the ethanol industry has been completed by farmer-owned cooperatives. The Department of Agriculture estimates that a 100 million gallon ethanol plant will add 2,250 jobs to a community--enhancing rural development and expansion. In short, the ethanol industry is an economic engine driving investment and opportunities across rural America. 
Ethanol promotes competition and reduces consumer gasoline costs. Ethanol extends gasoline supplies, provides a valuable source of octane for independent gasoline marketers, assures competition in the oxygenate market for refiners trying to meet Clean Air Act standards, and reduces consumer costs of gasoline. As noted by the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America: 
The federal benefits afforded ethanol-blended fuels have been an important, pro-competitive influence on the nation's gasoline markets. By enhancing the ability of independent marketers to price-compete with their integrated oil company competitors, this program has increased independent marketers' economic viability and reduced consumers' costs of gasoline. 
Recognizing the competitive benefits of fuel ethanol in the market, Citizen Action, the Nation's largest consumer organization and strong supporter of the ethanol tax incentive, recently stated: 
The use of ethanol, a domestically produced, cleaner-burning renewable fuel helps American consumers use less polluting oil and reduces dependence on costly oil imports, which are in part subsidized by huge foreign tax credits. 
Ethanol improves the U.S. trade balance. Ethanol competes with MTBE, a methanol-derived oxygenate, as an octane--oxygenate--additive. Imports of MTBE have risen from just 30 million gallons in 1992 to more than 700 million gallons last year, or about 25 percent of domestic consumption. By displacing the demand for MTBE that would be necessary without ethanol, the U.S. trade imbalance is reduced by approximately $1.3 billion annually. But the trade implications of ethanol do not end there. The majority of the coproducts of ethanol production--corn gluten feed and corn gluten meal--are exported, further reducing the trade deficit by earning over $800 million annually. The net effect is a benefit to the U.S. trade imbalance of over $2 billion each year. 
Ethanol helps reduce air pollution. Ethanol adds oxygen to gasoline which reduces exhaust emissions of ozone-forming VOC's and carbon monoxide. It is widely used in reformulated gasolines currently being sold in ozone nonattainment areas across the country. Because ethanol adds octane to gasoline, it also reduces the use of other highly toxic petroleum-derived octanes, such as benzene, toluene and xylene. 
Ethanol enhances our national security. This Nation spends billions of dollars to protect our oil interests around the world. It is considerably less costly to defend the corn fields of the Dakotas than it is to defend foreign oil fields. 
Ethanol is good for agriculture. It is good for rural America. It is good for the environment. It reduces our dependance on foreign oil. The bottom line is that the Federal tax structure for ethanol deserves our continued support. I strongly oppose this amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be inserted in the appropriate place in the Congressional Record.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the Sense of the Senate Resolution on Indian Education submitted by Senator Domenici today. I am an original cosponsor of this resolution because of my strong commitment to prioritizing education for every American, and to bring attention to the ongoing inadequacies of education facilities and consistently feeble investment in student potential throughout Indian country. 
I have witnessed first-hand the devastating effects of poverty and unemployment that too often result from stunted academic growth. There are nine federally recognized tribes in South Dakota, whose members collectively make up one of the largest Native American populations in any state. At the same time, South Dakota has three of the ten poorest counties in the nation, all of which are within reservation boundaries. Unemployment on these extremely rural reservations averages above 50%. Yet economic depression on rural Indian reservations is not unique to my state. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this Resolution because Native Americans across the nation have been, and continue to be, disproportionately affected by both poverty and low educational achievement. In 1990, over 36% of Indian children ages 5-17 were living below the poverty level. The high school completion rate for Native Americans aged 20 to 24 was 12.5% below the national average. Indian students, on average, have scored far lower on the National Assessment for Education Progress indicators than all other students. In 1994, the combined average score for Indian students on the Scholastic Achievement Test was 65 points lower than the average for all students. These problems are compounded by the grave school facilities and construction backlog facing Indian Country. Currently, $680 million is needed for facilities construction, maintenance, and repair for the 185 BIA-funded schools and for public schools located on and near Indian reservations. These statistics reflect the continued neglect of America's under-served Indian population and are unacceptable. 
Congress must continue to promote the self-determination and self-sufficiency of Indian communities, in keeping with our special trust responsibility to sovereign Indian nations. Education at every level is absolutely vital to this effort. Education is the cornerstone of the success of great nations and is a basic right of all persons. At a time when education is at the top of the agenda both at the White House and in Congress, we must work together to focus national attention on education, on and off reservations. Our goal must be the creation of academic environments where every student will have the opportunity to reach their full potential and acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to create better opportunities for themselves and their children. 
With this Resolution, Senator Domenici is calling on the Congress to bring equity to education for all students of every age nationwide. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that my colleague has recognized the national need to improve education in Indian Country. Senator Domenici has developed this legislation in close consultation with Indian leaders, and I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this resolution.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to recognize the important work of Lloyd Weaver in ongoing flood recovery efforts in the Dakotas. 
Early this year, residents of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold temperatures. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane cleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead livestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace. As if surviving the severe winter cold was not challenge enough, residents of the upper Midwest could hardly imagine the extent of damage Mother Nature had yet to inflict with a 500-year flood. Record levels on the Big Sioux River and Lake Kampeska forced over 5,000 residents of Watertown, SD to evacuate their homes and left over one-third of the city without sewer and water for 3 weeks. The city of Bruce, SD was completely under water when record low temperatures turned swollen streams into sheets of ice. 
The 50,000 residents of Grand Forks, ND and 10,000 residents of East Grand Forks, MN, were forced to leave their homes and businesses as the Red River overwhelmed their cities in April. The devastation was astounding; an entire city underwater and a fire that gutted a majority of Grand Forks' downtown. Residents of both cities recently were allowed to return to what is left of their homes, and the long and difficult process of rebuilding shattered lives is just beginning. 
Lloyd Weaver lived through the 1972 flash flood that killed hundreds of people in Rapid City, SD. He knows what his North Dakota neighbors are currently experiencing. That's why Lloyd's Carpet and Cleaning Service in Rapid City chartered a plane and donated 25 large canisters of chemicals to deodorize homes in Grand Forks. Lloyd Weaver also met with relief officials and instructed them on the proper use of the chemical to help get homeowners and business people back on their feet. 
While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction wrought by this year's floods, I have been heartened to witness firsthand and hear accounts of South Dakotans coming together within their community to protect homes, farms, and entire towns from rising flood waters. The selfless actions of people like Lloyd Weaver illustrate the resolve within South Dakotans to help our neighbors in times of trouble. 
Mr. President, there is much more to be done to rebuild and repair Grand Forks and other impacted communities. Lloyd Weaver illustrates how one individual can bring some relief to the victims of this natural disaster, and I ask you to join me in thanking him for his selfless efforts.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to recognize the children of Candyland Daycare and Preschool in Rapid City, SD, in ongoing flood recovery efforts in the Dakotas.

Residents of both cities recently were allowed to return to what is left of their homes, and the long and difficult process of rebuilding shattered lives is just beginning. 
The children of Candyland Daycare and Preschool in Rapid City have been collecting toys, books, and puzzles for North Dakota flood victims. Many families escaped rising flood waters in the dead of night, often with only the clothes on their back, and ultimately lost everything in their homes. The goods collected by these children will help families rebuild their lives. The preschoolers also sent colored cards and a note that read: `Sorry to hear about the flood. Hope you'll be able to go home soon. Your South Dakota friends.'

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to recognize the important work of Dr. Ronald Tesch of Brookings, SD, in ongoing flood recovery efforts in the Dakotas.

The devastation was astounding; an entire city underwater and a fire that gutted a majority of Grand Forks' downtown. Residents of both cities recently were allowed to return to what is left of their homes, and the long and difficult process of rebuilding shattered lives is just beginning. 
Carl Madsen's daughter was one of many Grand Forks individuals who escaped rising flood waters in the dead of night, often with only the clothes on their back. Her son, who is 10 years old, wears eyeglasses and left them behind in their now demolished Grand Forks home. An optician, Dr. Ronald Tesch, was kind enough to give the boy an exam, new prescription, and eyeglasses all for free since Mr. Madsen's daughter had little money left.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to recognize the important work of the McCook County ambulance crew, Brad Stiefvater, Todd Matthies, and Doug Mokros, in ongoing disaster recovery efforts in South Dakota. 
Early this year, residents of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold temperatures. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane cleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead livestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace.

The city of Bruce, SD was completely under water when record low temperatures turned swollen streams into sheets of ice. 
At the height of the snowstorms in South Dakota, the McCook County ambulance crew was called to the home of Steve and Sheila Hoiten to deliver the couple's baby. Wind gusts of 40 miles per hour dropped the temperature to nearly 70 degrees below zero and created near white-out conditions as Brad, Todd, and Doug drove the family 45 miles to Sioux Falls. The ambulance crew battled drifts 8 to 9 feet high to get the couple safely to the hospital where Morgan Ann Hoiten was born, safe and sound. 
While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction wrought by this year's snowstorms and floods, I have been heartened to witness firsthand and hear accounts of South Dakotans coming together within their community to protect homes, farms, and entire towns from vicious winter weather and rising flood waters. The selfless actions of the McCook County ambulance crew illustrate the resolve within South Dakotans to help our neighbors in times of trouble. 
Mr. President, there is much more to be done to rebuild and repair our impacted communities. Brad Stiefvater, Todd Matthies, and Doug Mokros of the McCook County search and rescue unit illustrate how the actions of a community can bring some relief to the victims of this natural disaster, and I ask you to join me in thanking them for their selfless efforts.

Residents of both cities recently were allowed to return to what is left of their homes, and the long and difficult process of rebuilding shattered lives is just beginning. 
Heavy winter snows forced Big Stone Lake, along the South Dakota and Minnesota border, to 9 feet above flood level. The rising waters drove 40 families from their homes and caused vast amounts of damage. Volunteers from the surrounding communities quickly came to the residents' assistance, but once the flood waters began to recede, residents faced countless hours of clean up on their own. That is when the 45 young men of Troops 48, 112, 152, 159, and 582 rose to the challenge and traveled to Big Stone City to help residents clean up. 
While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction wrought by this year's floods, I have been heartened to witness firsthand and hear accounts of South Dakotans coming together within their community to protect homes, farms, and entire towns from rising flood waters. The selfless actions of Boy Scout Troops 48, 112, 152, 159, and 582 illustrate the resolve within South Dakotans to help our neighbors in times of trouble.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to recognize the important work of South Dakota rural letter carriers in providing mail service to rural residents despite record flooding and washed-out roads. 
Early this year, residents of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold temperatures. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane cleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead livestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace.

The city of Bruce, SD was completely under water when record low temperatures turned swollen streams into sheets of ice. 
The average rural mail route is 95 miles long in South Dakota, compared to 35 miles in the rest of the country. This spring's flooding added to that distance as a number of Federal, State, and county roads were submerged under running water. I have received numerous reports of Postal Service employees taking extraordinary steps to provide service to their fellow South Dakotans during this disaster. Often, this service has been provided at their own expense. 
While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction wrought by this year's floods, I have been heartened to witness first-hand and hear accounts of South Dakotans helping to restore the livelihood of their community. The selfless actions of individuals like the South Dakota rural letter carriers illustrate the resolve within South Dakotans to help our neighbors in times of trouble. 
Mr. President, there is much more to be done to rebuild and repair impacted communities.

Residents of both cities recently were allowed to return to what is left of their homes, and the long and difficult process of rebuilding shattered lives is just beginning. 
Renee Parker organized a United Way Jeans Day promotion that continues to amass monetary funds for flood victims. Many families escaped rising flood waters in the dead of night, often with only the clothes on their back, and ultimately lost everything in their homes. I am pleased to say the Jeans Day promotion has collected over $6,350 to help buy goods for these families. Renne Parker has also been instrumental in organizing the Jeans Day promotion for flood victims on a national basis.

Many families escaped rising flood waters in the dead of night, often with only the clothes on their back, and ultimately lost everything in their homes. I am pleased to say that Butler Machinery has transported over 30 truckloads of items so far to Grand Forks, helping families rebuild their lives.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. We have finally reached a point this afternoon that has been awaited for some time by the people of South Dakota, North Dakota and Minnesota, and 30 other States that have been seriously and negatively impacted by the blizzards and floods of this past winter and spring. It had been my hope the passage of this legislation could have been accelerated and without the contention we had to deal with over this past month. 
But I do at this point today want to extend thanks to Senator Stevens for his assistance on this legislation, certainly to Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader; Senator Byrd, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee; Senators Dorgan and Conrad of North Dakota, my colleagues from the north; and Senator Wellstone from Minnesota, in particular who have played a critical role on this floor helping educate the Members and the American public about the urgency and the severity of the crisis that our region faced here and continues to face. 
And certainly a thank you as well to President Clinton and his administration, who has responded in a timely fashion to the disaster requests from our Governor, from our State, affirmatively responding both to the blizzard and to the flood disaster requests on the very day that he received the requests, having visited our States, both in the south personally and with the Vice President and his Cabinet officials, and has become very acquainted in a direct way with the immense damage that was done in my State of South Dakota and throughout the region. 
So there are a lot of thank yous to be extended for the work on this legislation. But I think that we cannot underestimate the scope of the harm done and the reality that even this legislation, as significant as it is, will not make people whole. 
We are looking now, with the most recent estimates in the State of South Dakota, of livestock losses in excess of 300,000. We have an incredible level of damage to fences, to roads, and local governments bankrupt from the snow removal now finding themselves without even matching money to come up with the repair of the roads. That is one of the reasons why the CDBG, the community development block grant, aspect of this will be so critically important. 
We have families looking to relocate. We have levees to be rebuilt. We have mayors asking about the repair of their waste water treatment facilities and water treatment facilities. We have rural water projects and systems throughout the State that have been damaged in significant ways. 
So in so many ways this legislation is going to be critical in helping people get their lives back together, to making decisions about the future of their homes, of their families, of their farms and ranches and of our public infrastructure. 
This legislation will come as badly needed assistance, a hand up, and consistent with a tradition that has marked the American approach to disasters in any part of the country. Whether it has been earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, we have a long tradition in this country of setting aside our partisan differences and working together with a hand up so that people can get back on their feet, at least have the resources to begin that long trek back. 
But I think that the winners of this final resolution of the conflicts that we have had are more than just the people of the Dakotas and the Great Plains and all the States that have been affected by these disasters. The American public in general has won this debate over the last several weeks. There was a sense on the part of the American public that we need to handle one issue at a time, that when it comes to disasters, that ought to be a clean bill sent to the President of the United States. 
That ultimately is what has transpired, I think in large part because of the great concern and attention given to this 
legislation by Americans from one coast to the other, many of them living in States that have not had significant disaster problems this past year, but recognize that that hand up is part of the American tradition and also recognize that in the past when we have had emergency legislation it has been devoid of controversial extraneous matters.

Mr. JOHNSON. So we have maintained that precedent and not moved away from the tradition in this country that we have had in this body of dealing directly with legislation so that it may in a timely fashion get to the people who need it. 
It would have been, I think, a tremendous loss and would have been a bad precedent for the future if we had not in fact voted down legislation with controversial issues and used disaster legislation as a political vehicle. So I think that we have won the short-term battle to get help to people who need it but also won the long-term battle for people who need legislation.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to recognize the important work of two McCook County Highway Department employees, Bob Bellack and Ron Heumiller, in ongoing disaster recovery efforts in South Dakota. 
Early this year, residents of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold temperatures. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane cleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead livestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace. As if surviving the severe winter cold was not challenge enough, residents of the Upper Midwest could hardly imagine the extent of damage Mother Nature had yet to inflict with a 500-year flood. Record levels on the Big Sioux River and Lake Kampeska forced over 5,000 residents of Watertown, SD, to evacuate their homes and left over one-third of the city without sewer and water for 3 weeks. The city of Bruce, SD was completely underwater when record low temperatures turned swollen streams into sheets of ice. 
At the height of the snowstorms in South Dakota, Bob Bellack and Ron Heumiller drove snowplows at 3 to 4 miles per hour and in zero visibility to open roads for rescue and emergency medical crews. Wind gusts of 40 miles per hour dropped the temperature to nearly 70 degrees below zero as the medical crews followed Bob and Ron for 263 miles to rescue families without heat and stranded motorists from all over the county. 
While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction wrought by this year's snowstorms and floods, I have been heartened to witness firsthand and hear accounts of South Dakotans coming together within their community to protect homes, farms, and entire towns from vicious winter weather and rising flood waters. The selfless actions of Bob Bellack and Ron Heumiller illustrate the resolve within South Dakotans to help our neighbors in times of trouble. 
Mr. President, there is much more to be done to rebuild and repair our impacted communities. Bob Bellack, Ron Heumiller, and the individuals at the McCook County Highway Department illustrate how the actions of a community can bring some relief to the victims of this natural disaster, and I ask you to join me in thanking them for their selfless efforts.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to recognize the important work of Lori Russell and Barb Navrisky in ongoing flood recovery efforts in the Dakotas. 
Early this year, residents of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold temperatures. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane cleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead livestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace. As if surviving the severe winter cold was not challenge enough, residents of the Upper Midwest could hardly imagine the extent of damage Mother Nature had yet to inflict with a 500-year flood. Record levels on the Big Sioux River and Lake Kampeska forced over 5,000 residents of Watertown, SD to evacuate their homes and left over one-third of the city without sewer and water for 3 weeks. The city of Bruce, SD was completely underwater when record low temperatures turned swollen streams into sheets of ice. 
The 50,000 residents of Grand Forks, ND and 10,000 residents of East Grand Forks, MN were forced to leave their homes and businesses as the Red River overwhelmed their cities in April. The devastation was astounding; an entire city underwater and a fire that gutted a majority of Grand Forks' downtown. Residents of both cities recently were allowed to return to what is left of their homes, and the long and difficult process of rebuilding shattered lives is just beginning. 
Barb Navrisky lived through the 1972 flash flood that killed hundreds of people in Rapid City, SD. She knows what her North Dakota neighbors are currently experiencing. Lori Russell knows the devastation all too well. Her parents, Eman and Leona Hejlik, live in Grand Forks and lost their home in the flood. That's why both Barb and Lori mobilized the city of Box Elder, SD and collected clothing, cleaning supplies, food, and toys for flood victims in Grand Forks. Lori and Barb's relief effort included the mayor of Box Elder, Dave Kinser, raising $200 in donations for a Grand Forks resident who lost everything. Students from area high schools and elementary schools also helped by collecting cleaning supplies and food items. 
While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction wrought by this year's floods, I have been heartened to witness firsthand and hear accounts of South Dakotans coming together within their community to protect homes, farms, and entire towns from rising flood waters. The selfless actions of people like Lori Russell and Barb Navrisky illustrate the resolve within South Dakotans to help our neighbors in times of trouble. 
Mr. President, there is much more to be done to rebuild and repair Grand Forks and other impacted communities. Lori Russell and Barb Navrisky illustrate how two individuals can bring some relief to the victims of this natural disaster, and I ask you to join me in thanking them for their selfless efforts.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to recognize the important work of Leo Flynn in ongoing flood recovery efforts in the Dakotas. 
Early this year, residents of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold temperatures.

The city of Bruce, SD was completely underwater when record low temperatures turned swollen streams into sheets of ice. Heavy winter snows forced Big Stone Lake, along the South Dakota and Minnesota border, to 9 feet above flood level. The rising waters drove 40 families from their homes and caused vast amounts of damage. 
Many South Dakota communities prepared for the floods by constructing makeshift dikes around homes and neighborhoods. While some of these barriers held up against the rising water, a number of communities saw their defenses washed away in the record levels of flooding. The costs of preparing for, and ultimately cleaning up after, these natural disasters strained municipal budgets and threatened other flood recovery programs. Milbank attorney Leo Flynn came to the assistance of a number of counties and towns by donating $280,000 to help local governments cover the costs of blizzards and flooding.

Once again, Emm mobilized fellow members of Betta Sigma Phi to host a series of Friendship Vanishing Coffee Parties in hopes of raising another $5,000 for Grand Forks flood victims. The money will help families who lost everything in the devastating floods rebuild their lives.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution. 
Mr. President, this bipartisan budget agreement represents a hard-fought achievement for our nation. It is neither the perfect plan, nor is it the plan that I would write if I were solely responsible for this enormous task. What this plan does represent, however, is a compromise between two parties, a compromise between Congress and the administration, and a delicate balance of important national investment and tax priorities. Under the circumstances, no plan could be perfect. This plan, nevertheless, is a good plan. 
Mr. President, this plan is the culmination of more than 2 years of debate. During the course of this debate we have witnessed several critical events: the shutdown of the Federal Government, the death of the so-called Contract With America, and the emergence of a group of centrists committed to a sensible approach to balancing the Federal budget. 
In order to understand this agreement in its proper context, we should take a moment to remember that this agreement today would not be possible without tough votes cast by Democrats on the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993. The success of that deficit reduction package is indisputable. When President Clinton took office in January 1993, the Federal budget deficit stood at $290 billion. Experts are now projecting a deficit for this year in the range of $67 billion. We have seen, for the first time in a century, declining deficits for 5 years in a row, and the deficit as a percentage of the size of the economy is at its lowest in decades. Not a single Republican supported the 1993 deficit reduction bill. Not one. Yet, without this enormous achievement, we could not be finishing the job today. 
It is also vitally important that we remember the great battle over the shape of Government that has taken place over the past 2 years. At the beginning of the 104th Congress, we heard talk of a revolution. We were told that we needed to cut Medicare by $270 billion over 7 years. We were told that Medicaid should be reduced by $170 billion, and that Federal Government would no longer guarantee health care coverage for the poorest Americans. And we were told that the earned income tax credit--a program that reduces the tax burden on low- to moderate-income working families--should be cut by $32 billion. Speaker Gingrich's revolution also called for massive reductions in discretionary spending, leading to cuts in critical education programs, veterans' programs, and environmental protection. 
These large-scale reductions would be necessary because Speaker Gingrich's plan contained a massive tax cut of $280 billion over 7 years. The majority of the tax cuts would be of little benefit to typical American families. In fact, with the 
cuts in the EITC, many families needing the most help would have paid higher taxes. 
Democrats knew that there was a better way. We said that we could balance the budget by 2002, but we had to do it with the right priorities. We said that we could balance the budget while enacting a modest package of tax cuts that would be targeted to typical American families. We said that we could preserve Medicare, invest in education, and balance the budget. This budget agreement proves that we were right. 
With a better-targeted tax cut package, this agreement allows us to balance the budget while making investments in critical priorities. The agreement provides $35 billion in tax cuts for education, funding for the child tax credit, and still leaves room for relief in estate and capital gains taxes. 
The agreement would increase funding for Pell grants by $8.6 billion over 5 years. This funding boost would increase the maximum Pell grant to $3,000--which is a $300 increase--and it would expand eligibility so that more students can be provided assistance. 
The agreement will provide $16 billion over 5 years for innovative new programs to provide health care coverage for 5 million children who have no health insurance. This achievement stands in stark contrast to proposals in the Contract With America that would have removed the Federal guarantee of health care coverage under Medicaid. 
The bipartisan agreement allows for the largest expansion of education programs since the time that Lyndon Johnson was President. Head Start will be expanded by $2.7 billion, allowing for 1 million children to be enrolled in this critical program by 2002. This is a vast improvement over the Contract With America, which called for the elimination of the Department of Education, cuts in student loans, and reductions in Head Start. 
The agreement provides for growth in Federal student loan programs, increasing student loan volume by $7 billion by the year 2002. In contrast, the Contract With America would have added to student debt burdens by charging interest while the students were still in school. 
The agreement will reform Medicare to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund for 10 years. Rather than receive benefit reductions, Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible for new preventive care benefits, such as mammography coverage, other cancer screening, and diabetes management. 
The agreement will implement President Clinton's proposed budget for the National Park Service, producing an increase of $57 million over current budget levels. 
The budget plan provides key funding for crop insurance programs, allocating $200 million necessary from discretionary funds to reimburse crop insurance agents for the cost of administering the program. 
The agreement will fund the President's budget request for tribal priority allocations, which pay for law enforcement, child protection, education, and road maintenance on our Nation's reservations. This provision will boost funding by $200 million for the next fiscal year, and by $800 million over 5 years. 
I do want to take a moment, however, to express my concern that the tax-writing committees in both the House and the Senate take considerable care as they fill in the details of the agreement to reduce taxes by a net $85 billion over 5 years and $250 billion over 10 years. There may be great temptation to structure these tax cuts so that their full cost to the Treasury is not felt until the years beyond the 10-year path laid out by this agreement. It would be a grave mistake, and highly irresponsible, to pass into law a tax cut package that could not be sustained over the long term. Our goal should be to keep this budget in balance for good. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues on these committees to keep long-term fiscal considerations in mind. 
Mr. President, I want to thank all those on both sides of the aisle that spent countless hours negotiating this agreement. We have not yet finished the job, but the passage of this resolution is a crucial step down the road to balanced budget.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today, I am proud to be introducing legislation, along with my colleagues, the Minority Leader Senator Daschle of South Dakota, Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley of Iowa, and Senator Wellstone and Senator Grams of Minnesota, to authorize the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System. I introduced similar legislation last year as a Member of the House of Representatives during the 104th Congress. I look forward to again working closely with my colleagues for timely consideration of this important measure. 
The Lewis and Clark Rural Water System is made up of 22 rural water systems and communities in southeastern South Dakota, northwestern Iowa, and southwestern Minnesota who have joined together in an effort to cooperatively address the dual problems facing the delivery of drinking water in this region--inadequate quantities of water and poor quality water. 
This region has seen substantial growth and development in recent years, and studies have shown that future water needs will be significantly greater than the current available supply. Most of the people who are served by 10 of the water utilities in the proposed Lewis and Clark project area currently enforce water restrictions on a seasonal basis. Almost half of the membership has water of such poor quality it does not meet present or proposed standards for drinking water. More than two-thirds rely on shallow aquifers as their primary source of drinking water, aquifers which are very vulnerable to contamination by surface activities. 
The Lewis and Clark system will be a supplemental supply of drinking water for its 22 members, acting as a treated, bulk delivery system. The distribution to deliver water to individual users will continue through the existing systems used by each member utility. This regionalization approach to solving these water supply and quality problems enables the Missouri River to provide a source of clean, safe drinking water to more than 180,000 individuals. A source of water which none of the members of Lewis and Clark could afford on their own. 
The proposed system would help to stabilize the regional rural economy by providing water to Sioux Falls, the hub city in the region, as well as numerous small communities and individual farms in South Dakota and portions of Iowa and Minnesota. 
The States of South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota have all authorized the project and local sponsors have demonstrated a financial commitment to this project through State grants, local water development district grants, and membership dues. The State of South Dakota has already contributed more than $400,000. 
Mr. President, I do not believe our needs get any more basic than good quality, reliable drinking water, and I appreciate the fact that Congress has shown support for efforts to improve drinking water supplies in South Dakota. I look forward to continue working with my colleagues to have that support extended to the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Moseley-Braun's amendment to the Budget Resolution that would provide $5 billion for a national school construction initiative. I would like to commend Senator Moseley-Braun for her leadership on this issue, and I would also like to thank Senators Kennedy and Harkin for their fine efforts to address this critical problem. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment. Crumbling schools are not just an urban problem. They are a nationwide problem, and rural areas are no exception. In fact, 30 percent of schools in rural areas report at least one inadequate building feature. 
A 1996 report by the General Accounting Office found that in my home state of South Dakota, 25 percent of schools have inadequate plumbing, 21 percent of schools have roof problems, 29 percent have ventilation problems, and 21 percent percent of schools are not meeting safety codes. 
We have adopted a nationwide goal of trying to connect every school building in the country to the internet. Teaching our children to use new this technology is critical for preparing them for the 21st century. Yet, in my home state, 22 percent of schools have inadequate electrical wiring. In their present condition, these schools cannot accommodate computers in the classroom. 
South Dakota's tribal schools also face very serious facilities problems and major construction backlogs. There are nine federally recognized tribes in South Dakota. At the same time, my State has 3 of the 10 poorest counties in the nation, all of which are within reservation boundaries. 
With 56 percent of its people under the age of 24, the native American population in this country is disproportionately young when compared the American population overall. This population strains existing school facilities. The BIA estimates that there is a construction backlog of $680 million in its 185 elementary, secondary and boarding schools serving Indian children on 63 reservations in 23 States. Of these schools, 63 percent are over 30 years old; 26 percent are over 50 years old. Annual appropriations for BIA education facilities improvement and repair have averaged $37 million annually, which unfortunately meets only 5 percent of total need. 
Nationwide, the statistics are similarly ominous. Crumbling schools are a problem of enormous magnitude. Fourteen million children attend classes in buildings that need major repair or renovation. Seven million children go to school in buildings that have safety code violations. Sixteen million children study in classrooms without proper heating, ventilation, or air conditioning. 
It is nearly impossible to measure the impact that these conditions have on students' ability to learn, but there is no doubt that the impact is severe. 
Clearly, there is much we can do to improve our existing school building infrastructure. But that is only part of the problem. Our Nation is experiencing significant growth in school enrollment. Estimates are that we will need to build 6,000 new schools by the year 2006 if we want to keep class sizes the same as they are presently. 
This amendment would allocate $5 billion to the House and Senate committees of jurisdiction to devise a school construction and renovation initiative. We are not mandating a specific approach in this amendment. Rather, we hope that this $5 billion Federal contribution can be used in partnership with State and local efforts to leverage over $20 billion of dollars of construction activity nationwide. An effort of this magnitude would benefit our students for generations, and I am proud to support this amendment.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce legislation to authorize a critically important rural water system in South Dakota, the Fall River Water Users District Rural Water System Act of 1997. This legislation is strongly supported by local project sponsors who have demonstrated that support by agreeing to substantial financial contributions from the local level. I am pleased to introduce this legislation today, along with my colleague from South Dakota, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. Both Senator Daschle and I were sponsors of similar legislation in the 104th Congress, and we will work together to enact this necessary rural water legislation in the 105th Congress. 
Like many parts of South Dakota, Fall River County has insufficient water supplies of reasonable quality available, and the water supplies that are available do not meet the minimum health and safety standards. In addition to improving the health of residents in the region, I strongly believe that these rural drinking water delivery projects will help to stabilize the rural economy in both regions. Water is a basic commodity and is essential if we are to foster rural development in many parts of rural South Dakota, including the Fall River County area. 
Past cycles of severe drought in the southeastern area of Fall River County have left local residents without a satisfactory water supply and during 1990, many homeowners and ranchers were forced to haul water to sustain their water needs. 
Currently, many residents are either using bottled water for human consumption or they are using distillers due to the poor quality of the water supplies available. After conducting a feasibility study and preliminary engineering report, the best available, reliable, and safe rural and municipal water supply to serve the needs of the Fall River Water Users District consists of a Madison Aquifer well, three separate water storage reservoirs, three pumping stations, and approximately 200 miles of pipeline. The legislation I am introducing today authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to construct a rural water system in Fall River County as described above. The Fall River system will serve rural residents, as well as the community of Oelrichs and the Angostura State Recreation Area. 
Mr. President, South Dakota is plagued by water of exceedingly poor quality, and the Fall River County rural water project is an effort to help provide clean water--a commodity most of us take for granted--to the people of South Dakota. I am a strong believer in the role of the Federal Government to help in the delivery of rural water, and I hope to continue to advance that agenda both in South Dakota and around the country. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to move forward on enactment as quickly as possible.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the motion to strike by the Senator from West Virginia, and I thank, as well, the work and support from the Senator from Alaska on this matter. 
Mr. President, there is a tremendous amount of pain and suffering across many States of the Union. In my State of South Dakota, where thousands of people have been evacuated, many are still not back in their homes, contamination of flood water is present, hundreds of thousands of livestock have been lost, businesses have been shut down, roads are still under water, there has been incredible damage to culverts and bridges, and public schools have suffered. 
This is no time to use the suffering of these people as a point of leverage to compel this Congress and the President of the United States to accept an extraneous budget amendment. As a member of the Budget Committee, I welcome an opportunity to debate those who believe there ought to be a reduction in aid to schools, kids nutrition programs, law enforcement, environmental protection, or cancer research, among other items, that ought to be reduced. I welcome that debate. That is what this institution is for. 
But South Dakotans wonder, as I think Americans wonder, why can't this Congress handle one issue at a time rather than tying extraneous issues onto bills of incredible urgency? Let us deal with this disaster in a constructive, positive and bipartisan way, and then take up the budget issues that have been raised by the CR issue in a separate context, and have a full-blown debate on the real consequence of these budget priorities. Some, no doubt, will win, and some may lose, but let them be debated separately and not try to tie the President's hand, not try to use the suffering of thousands of people in this country as a point of leverage for an agenda that he cannot accept and which will only in the end delay the urgent assistance so badly needed in my State of South Dakota and in some 30 other States, as well, as a result of the natural disasters that we have faced over these last several months. 
I think this is simply a matter of equity and of fairness. We seem to be in the process of reaching a bipartisan budget agreement. That is a helpful step. We should take each process, one at a time, in its rightful order, and deal with this disaster now, and then deal in a timely fashion with the rest of the budget priority issues in their order. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I have to my right a satellite image of the James River in South Dakota; on the left, depicting the river in its normal course prior to the flooding. On the right is a satellite image showing the current state of the James River--swollen, in places miles across, with water in a circumstance where less than 5 percent of the farmland in the James River Valley, from North Dakota to Nebraska, will be planted this year. This imagery was provided by the aerial data center in South Dakota. I think it very ably shows the dire circumstances that people in the James River area are facing. 
Amendment No. 70 is an amendment offered by myself and by my colleague, Senator Daschle, which addresses the extensive damage that has taken place in the James River Valley and which needs to be addressed. This amendment addresses the problem, where up to 75 percent of the trees in this area have been lost, where bank sloughing and levee sloughing has filled the channel and reduced its capability to handle water. The amendment would provide a $10 million appropriation through the Corps of Engineers to the James River Water Development District to use for the badly needed repair and restoration work on the James River. 
This is a 25-percent cost share. I am pleased that this amendment has been cleared and approved by the majority and the minority of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I thank Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus and their staffs for their willingness to work with us on these amendments. I also thank the appropriators, Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd, Senator Domenici and Senator Reid from the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittees and their staffs, for their willingness to work with us on the language of this amendment, and to accept it as part of the supplemental appropriations legislation being considered by the Senate today. 
Mr. President, this amendment will go a long way toward restoring the James River and its water-carrying capacity, to restore its wildlife, to restore the economic life of the area on either side of this river, and it will do a great deal to assure residents of this area that we will not see flooding of this magnitude, of this devastating scope, any time soon again. 
I had the opportunity to fly over the James River to take an aerial survey of this area this past month, flying out of Pierre, SD, flying over Mitchell, then back over Aberdeen, over Sand Lake Wildlife Refuge to gain a full appreciation of the magnitude of this flood. 
We have a great deal of flood problems in other areas of South Dakota, but this amendment addresses the dire circumstances that the people in the James River Valley face. 
I thank, again, my colleagues for their cooperation and their assistance with this amendment. It certainly is my hope that we can very expeditiously pass the supplemental appropriations bill, get it to the President's desk for his signature and to get on with rebuilding the lives of our communities, of our businesses and of our families, in this case, in the James River Valley. 
I yield back the remainder of my time, Mr. President.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act of 1997 as a noncontroversial and bipartisan amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill being considered on the floor of the Senate today. 
I want to particularly extend thanks to Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd for their assistance on this amendment and support of this amendment, as well as their very timely action on the underlying supplemental appropriations legislation. And thanks to Senator D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes of the Banking Committee for their support as well, and, of course, to Senator Grams, my colleague from Minnesota, who has done extraordinary work on this legislation. I am proud to join him as a cosponsor of S. 652. 
We have had an incredible series of catastrophic events in the Northern Plains, in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. It is absolutely essential that this body move expeditiously to provide as much assistance as possible to get individuals, families, businesses, and local governments back on their feet. 
This amendment would give the banking regulators the authority to cut through red tape to expedite the handling of loans and deposits for banks, credit unions, and savings and loans in order to move along the rebuilding of our part of the country as quickly as possible. 
This legislation has the support of both FDIC and the Federal Reserve. In our three States we have suffered vitally over these last several months. Hundreds of thousands of livestock have been lost, roads are under water, schools closed, hospitals closed. Family businesses are in tremendous stress right now. It is absolutely essential that we provide every element of assistance we possibly can. 
I share Senator Grams' belief that this legislation will be one more piece of the puzzle necessary to reach that goal. The predecessor of this legislation was a similar amendment enacted in 1992 and 1993. So this is a step that has been taken in the past when our Nation has been undergoing stressful disaster circumstances. 
It is very, very appropriate during this year that we reintroduce this amendment to provide this kind of temporary but very important relief. Again, this amendment is bipartisan. It should be noncontroversial. 
I again commend Senator Grams for his leadership in bringing this amendment to the floor. 
I yield back. 
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

Mr. JOHNSON. First, the Senator from Minnesota has done yeoman work in trying to bring relief to the tremendous, catastrophic disaster that has taken place in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota over the recent months. We have 125,000 people rendered homeless in those States currently. I have visited all three States, and I have seen families, even those who can get back into their homes, who have no sewage, have no water, the roads are broken up. They are doing dishes in campers and using port-o-johns that are temporarily installed in the front yard, and sandbags are everywhere. It is chaos in so many of these areas. Livestock have been lost, equipment has been lost, buildings have collapsed under the weight of snow, culverts are out of place, bridges are down. The loss is a mess through this part of the northern Great Plains. It has been a disaster that has visited 22 States, although the Senator and I are most familiar with the problems, obviously, of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. We have tremendous urgency for assistance, as this country has always done during times of this level of distress. 
It appears that if extraneous language is added to this disaster legislation, for which there is broad-based bipartisan support, that will jeopardize the passage of the legislation and, even if it were to pass, would subject it to a veto and we would be back to square one. Timeliness will have been lost and we will have delayed the level of assistance that is so badly needed on an urgent basis. 
I ask the Senator from Minnesota, does it appear to the Senator that among the most egregious things trying to be added or forced on to this legislation are proposals that, while they are referred to as a 98-percent CR, which to many people would sound reasonably innocuous, but the real consequence of that would be, would it not, over the coming year that we would in fact see college aid cut by $1.8 billion, 400,000 students would lose Pell grants, 52,000 children would be cut from Head Start, 
we would have to end the Crop Insurance Program--one of the very vehicles that is being used to provide some level of relief for the farmers and ranchers who have been badly hit by this disaster--200,000 veterans would lose medical care, 700,000 mothers and infants per month would lose Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Program services, Indian health services would be cut, there would be 500 fewer air traffic controllers and 173 fewer security officers hired for purposes of air security. Is it not correct that not only would we have to buy into this, but I would have to ask the Senator from Minnesota, procedurally, is it not also correct that we would not be permitted a vote up or down and there would be no debate on policy initiatives of such enormous consequence if we were to allow this kind of extraneous language onto the emergency legislation that we so badly need to pass immediately?

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am proud to be an original sponsor, along with my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Grams, of the Depository Institution Relief Act of 1997. This act represents a small measure that we in Congress can undertake to help alleviate some of the suffering caused in South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota by the natural disasters of this past winter and spring. 
South Dakotans are a hearty stock, and during my years serving the people of South Dakota, I have repeatedly witnessed their ability to overcome any obstacle Mother Nature throws their way. However, I don't believe I have ever seen South Dakotans rise to the occasion in quite the manner they are right now. I recently toured the disaster areas of South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota with both President Clinton and Vice-President Gore and viewed terrible scenes of cattle stranded in fields, dead cattle across the area, flooded highways, communities lining up to pile sandbags, and people forced to stay in motels because their homes are in such danger. The devastation caused to Grand Forks, ND will not soon be forgotten by those who witnessed nature's awesome fury first-hand. The situation in South Dakota also was far worse than I expected. During my recent tour, I saw a compelling combination of the furor of Mother Nature and the determination of South Dakotans, North Dakotans, and Minnesotans to survive yet another battle with this awesome force. Mother Nature--as only she can do--had changed the rules of the game and given the residents of our region more water than initially anticipated and more than we could safely handle. 
But, through it all--through all the heart-wrenching, indiscriminate loss of property, possessions, and livestock--folks in our South Dakota communities have pulled together. The scene in my home State, and across the region, is something that nearly defies description, but clearly will not be forgotten for many years to come. As the flood waters begin to recede, and these hard-working folks begin to rebuild shattered lives, I rise to seek the support of my colleagues in providing certain regulatory relief that will greatly enable this process. As we did in response to previous tragic flooding along the Mississippi River in 1992 and 1993, let us now undertake to do for the residents of South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota through the Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act of 1997. 
This act will enable lending institutions--banks, credit unions, and thrifts--to help the people most severely affected by this disaster to begin the arduous process of recovery. The bill permits the regulatory agencies to waive some of the regulations which delay the procedures for helping these people. The major provisions will allow consumers to receive loan proceeds 3 days faster than they ordinarily would, helps lending institutions reopen for business quicker even though the disruption from the flooding may require more than 1 day to process cash deposits and government checks, and loosens capitalization requirements that will be buffeted by the large amounts of insurance deposits that will shortly be flowing through the region. We also call upon Federal regulators to use their ability to waive certain appraisal standards for real estate loans in the disaster areas. These actions will enable the regulating agencies to work with the primary lending institutions to make it easier for the impacted citizens to begin the strenuous and extremely difficult process of recovery. 
Mr. President, my region has just suffered a 500-year flood right on the heels of the worst winter in memory. As the valiant residents of South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota begin to rebuild their lives and homes, I urge the Congress to take these minimal steps to help that process. 
The Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act of 1997 represents an immediate, concrete step we can and should take in that direction. I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to attach this important disaster relief bill to the supplemental appropriations bill which will be considered by the Senate in the near future.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act introduced by Senator D'Amato, and to thank Chairman D'Amato for moving so quickly in response to the needs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in efforts to crack down on the exploitation of our vulnerable low-income senior citizens. 
The Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act will assure that a homeowner pursuing a HUD home equity conversion mortgage, or reverse mortgage, is not charged unnecessary or excessive costs for obtaining that mortgage. The median age of reverse mortgage applicants is 76 years. Most of these borrowers are very low-income, Social Security dependents, typically seeking additional funds for basic needs and medical expenses. Information on the program and the application process is provided by HUD free of charge. Yet, some businesses have been convincing seniors of services and counseling required before reverse mortgages can be secured. Many of these middlemen charge up to 10 percent for services that seniors do not realize are unnecessary.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce legislation that would require that imported meat and meat food products containing imported meat be labeled for country of origin so that consumers can make the choice to buy meat produced from livestock raised on American ranches and farms. This act would require that these products be labeled for country of origin prior to their sale at the retail level in the United States. 
Senator Craig, Senator Daschle, Senator Burns, and Senator Baucus join me today in introducing this needed policy change. I welcome and applaud their support. I would also point out to my colleagues the support this legislation has received from the National Farmers Union, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and the American Sheep Industry. From my State, this legislation is supported by the South Dakota Farmers Union, South Dakota Farm Bureau, South Dakota Livestock Auction Markets Association, and the South Dakota Cattlemen's Association. I hope that other Senators join us in support of this measure and help us to quickly pass this bill. 
America's livestock producers are proud of their record of producing quality meat and meat food products from American raised livestock. While labeling products from other industries for country of origin is commonplace, imported meat and meat food products containing imported meat are often not labeled at all. With the passage of the Canadian Free-Trade Agreement, NAFTA, and GATT, we are moving toward more imported meat. Exports of American meat are high quality, value added items that American exporters are proud to advertise as American produced. On the other hand, meat imports into the United States tend to be of lower quality and importers generally do not advertise the country of origin. 
American consumers deserve to know the source of their meat and meat food products. The legislation that my colleagues and I are introducing will allow America's consumers to know the source of their meat and meat food products. Considering that food safety and the wisdom of production systems in other countries are concerns that consumers consistently have, this legislation allows the competitive free market to determine the prices and demand for imported meat and meat food products. 
Finally, American taxpayers have invested heavily in our food safety system--and it is undoubtedly the safest in the world. It just makes good sense for these same taxpayers and consumers to know the origin of the meat they buy.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to commend and recognize the strength and tenacity of the residents of my State of South Dakota, and also to further emphasize the importance of this body in expediting the President's request for supplemental appropriations for disasters occurring in the Great Plains and other parts of our country. 
I returned to Washington yesterday after spending 6 days touring the devastation occurring in virtually every corner of my State. South Dakotans are a hearty stock and during my years serving the citizens of South Dakota I have repeatedly witnessed South Dakotans' ability to overcome any obstacle Mother Nature has given us. However, I don't believe I have ever seen South Dakotans rise to the occasion in quite the manner they are doing right now under extraordinary circumstances. 
I traveled to South Dakota last week expecting to see widespread residual damage from the severe winter weather the State experienced over the past several months and subsequent high water from the ongoing snowpack melt. Relentless sub-zero temperatures and continual snowfall in January forced South Dakota Governor William Janklow to request a major disaster declaration from President Clinton to ensure roads could remain clear for emergency services and basic travel and access to livestock. President Clinton responded positively to the Governor's request and granted the declaration which gave the State additional tools to help meet its basic transportation needs. 
Farmers and ranchers began facing hard times last fall with normally available grazing and unharvested row crops being buried with snow. The subsequent extreme cold increased the nutritional requirements of livestock and depleted winter feed supplies. This already tough situation became a crisis when the early January blizzards literally killed livestock and put most producers' livestock at risk because of access to feed being cut off. No one yet knows how many livestock were killed, but estimates top at least 100,000. In addition, many livestock suffered frostbite and were significantly weakened. 
During this time, ordinary activities became extremely and increasingly difficult because of the excess snow. Wintertime expenses likely tripled as just getting livestock feed became a Herculean task. The continued stress on livestock, especially cattle, meant that the most important time of the year for ranchers--calving season--was approached with trepidation if not outright fear. Nutritional stress during late gestation makes for weak and dead calves. 
I toured the State during this winter storm disaster and was struck by the dramatic impact, particularly in the northeastern region of the State, of the winter weather. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane cleared with snow piled high on either side, homes without heat for days in the bitter cold, tens of thousands of dead livestock, schools closed for a week at a time, and the depletion of our indigenous wildlife populations were commonplace. I vividly remember watching a cow climb to the top of a snowdrift as high as the roof of the barn so that he could eat the shingles from the roof. And, I also remember the positive, stubborn attitude of the residents of South Dakota in the face of this disaster. South Dakotans knew that what they were facing was tough, but they also knew that they were tougher. 
As if surviving the severe winter cold of December, January, and February was not challenge enough, residents and State and local officials knew they could not rest from fighting the forces of Mother Nature. Once all of the roads were cleared, emergency services were no longer threatened, and it appeared that the worst of the winter weather was over, focus turned to the next challenge: potential flooding problems the State could experience once the snowpack began to melt. 
Governor William Janklow provided exceptional leadership with his comprehensive and aggressive efforts to get every community as ready as it could possibly be for the impending floods. Governor Janklow set up a state task force to monitor the flows of the rivers and to work with local governments in their preparations. State and local governments worked with the Corps of Engineers and the National Weather Service to predict precipitation and runoff levels, identify areas where additional flood protection measures should be undertaken, and design and implement additional flood control measures. The efforts made by communities were considerable. For example: 
In Sioux Falls, the largest city in South Dakota, the Big Sioux River flood protection system was temporarily bolstered to hold up to 41,000 cubic feet of water per second. It was designed in the 1950's and 1960's to hold 24,000 cubic feet--5,600 in the main river channel in western Sioux Falls and 18,400 in the diversion channel in the northeast corner of the city. Sioux Falls also aggressively sandbagged and used over 60,000 sandbags in its efforts. 
The small community of Davis filled and placed over 8,000 sandbags. Residents of the town of Hecla, population 400, built two dikes at the west and north ends of town to hold back the James River. In Aberdeen, the city built a levee about 2 feet high around the northern edge of the city in 
just 6 days. 
These are just a few examples of the mitigation efforts undertaken by communities all over South Dakota. Because of these efforts, from all reports, South Dakota communities could not have been better prepared for the anticipated flooding. I traveled to South Dakota early last week expecting to see high water fairly well controlled by these mitigation efforts with some areas faring worse than others. 
Unfortunately, the situation was worse than I anticipated because Mother Nature, as only she can do, had changed the rules of the game and given the residents of the State of South Dakota more water than initially anticipated and additional severe winter weather. The devastation I witnessed and subsequent destruction in the short time since my touring ended is heart-rending in its thoroughness and in its indiscriminate taking of property and possessions. 
Let me give just a few examples of the ways in which our communities have pulled together: 
In a relatively small community near Huron, 150 students, volunteers, and State inmates joined together to save the James Valley Christian School from the waters of the James River. Their efforts were absolutely inspiring. These individuals labored for days to stem the rushing James River with a sandbagged dike and sandbags all over the area to protect the school. Unfortunately, the James Valley Christian School lost its fight just days after I toured it. It now sits in 6 feet of water. 
I visited the farm of Gary and Diane Foster near Bruce, SD, where 30 head of cattle were calving on a small island surrounded by flood water. I will not soon forget this tragic sight. 
It was evident that our farmers will once again face a financially devastating problem in regard to springtime planting. Flooded fields prevent any field preparation, let alone planting. And there probably is not enough time for drying before it will simply become too late to plant this years' crops. In 1995, another very wet year, less than 40 percent of my State's crops were planted on time. 
The current flooding means that we probably will not even match 1995's slow performance. This is going to deal a tough blow to the agricultural economy of my State--and, in the end, it will deal a blow to consumers and businesses on Main Street. 
I was amazed by the reality that many South Dakotans who normally travel 10-15 miles to work, now have to drive 50-90 miles to work to avoid washed out or water covered roads, which often times are our major highways. The Sioux Falls Argus Leader reported that Janice Mellema, a nurse who lives west of Platte but works at the Gregory County Hospital, is forced to leave her home at 3:30 in the morning to arrive at work by 6. She now has a 90-mile commute. 
Some 100 people in north central South Dakota have already spent 30 days in a motel after they were evacuated from their homes because of rising water. This last weekend 5,000 people in Watertown, SD, have had to leave their homes. 
Essential services in many communities such as wastewater treatment plants are threatened. Many communities' systems have been overwhelmed and have been forced to release untreated water. 
Vital infrastructure has been dramatically impacted. During my tour, we drove on roads covered with water and saw many, many county roads completely washed away by a deluge of water. In McCook County every road that goes into the county from both the east to the west and from the north to the south are closed at some point. 
Just as South Dakotans were accepting and successfully fighting the increased flows of water, Mother Nature hit the State with yet another blizzard over the weekend. Some areas received 34 inches of snow accompanied by 60-mile-per-hour winds. This winter storm resulted in sub-zero wind chill temperatures and zero visibility in much of the State for an extended period of time. A 100-mile stretch of Interstate 90 was closed and many communities were forced to prohibit all travel. I was stranded in Wall, SD for over 24 hours because of this winter storm. 
This winter storm would have been a lot to handle as an isolated incident but coupled with the flooding already experienced all over the State, the impact of the winter weather has been unprecedented. The added precipitation and severe weather has led to unparalleled devastation. 
Last weekend's blizzard is truly salt in the wound for producers in my State. Our producers are in the middle of calving season now and trying to prepare for springtime field preparations. The blast of cold and more snow on top of already treacherous conditions will surely mean that the number of dead 
livestock will continue to rise. This may well put many producers over the edge financially--after all, they only get one chance per year to successfully complete calving season. 
This storm severely impacted the city of Watertown, causing the situation to escalate from a 100-year flood event to a 500-year flood event. Earlier this week, Mayor Brenda Barger, who I must commend for her effective leadership during this crisis, poignantly observed that, `It's a humbling thing when you see people out sandbagging in 60-mile-per-hour winds, in a blizzard, knee-deep in water.' I think her statement sums up a lot of what everyone has felt over the last few weeks and, in particular, the last few days. Everyone banded together to save and minimize damage to both public and private property regardless of the weather conditions. 
In a State that covers 80,000 square miles, it is both rare and unfortunate to have a situation where regions across the entire State are so disastrously affected by severe weather. The widespread nature of this disaster has devastated the agribusiness economy of our entire State and assistance in the coming months is absolutely critical to ensuring the future existence of many small businesses in South Dakota. The combined impact of the weather disasters over the last 5 months on agriculture is the gravest threat South Dakota farmers and ranchers have faced from nature in probably 100 years. Additionally, the damage done by the prolonged flooding has jeopardized the long-term viability of parts of South Dakota's infrastructure. Prior to the extensive damage done from this year's severe weather to South Dakota's roads, the State of South Dakota had an excess of $500 million in backlog needs on its State Highway System alone. And, the damage to personal property is as yet uncalculated in monetary or sentimental value. 
Our State has been fortunate enough to receive an outstanding response from President Clinton and FEMA in the past. I am grateful that, once again, the President has responded expeditiously with much needed assistance for South Dakota. Yesterday, the President made a major disaster declaration for the entire State which will supplement the efforts of the State and local governments during this difficult time. 
As I mentioned previously, the spirit of South Dakotans, even in this incredibly difficult time, never ceases to amaze me and this weekend's trip reemphasized that impression in my mind. I am committed to doing everything I can do to assist the State and communities as much as possible to ensure South Dakotans can get back to living their normal lives at the earliest possible time. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Daschle, Representative Thune, Governor Janklow, and local communities in the coming weeks and months as we clean up from this disaster. After all South Dakotans have endured over the past few months, they need all we can give. We need expeditious action on this floor on the supplemental appropriations requests.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the American Indian Transportation Improvement Act introduced by Senator Domenici. I am an original cosponsor of this bill because I feel strongly that the BIA and other Federal agencies must prioritize programs which develop infrastructure on reservations, and that the Congress must match those commitments with adequate funding. I know first hand the desperate need for road improvement and repair on South Dakota's Indian reservations, and I believe increased funding for road infrastructure must be a national priority. 
There are nine federally recognized tribes in South Dakota, whose members collectively make up one of the largest Native American populations in any State. At the same time, South Dakota has 3 of the 10 poorest counties in the Nation, all of which are within reservation boundaries. Unemployment on these extremely rural reservations averages above 50 percent. Yet economic depression on rural Indian reservations is not unique to my State. I strongly believe that road infrastructure is an integral and most basic component to economic development for Indian and non-Indian communities alike. 
Senator Domenici's initiative increases funding for reservation roads through the existing Indian Reservation Roads [IRR] Program. This program returns a portion of the gasoline tax, paid by every Indian who buys gasoline, to Indian tribes for the design and construction of BIA roads. This bill also expands opportunities under the IRR Program and related ISTEA programs to improve the transportation system on our Nation's Indian reservations, including bridge construction, transit systems, highway enhancements, scenic byways, and Indian technical centers. 
In South Dakota, BIA proposed funding for 1997 is 24 percent lower than 1996. Yet abysmal road conditions continue to worsen. There are nearly 8,000 miles of roads in my State, 1,156 miles of which are on reservations. Of these roads, 80 percent are in need of complete replacement. Another 10 percent are in need of significant repair. Only 10 percent of all the roads on South Dakota reservations are rated in good condition. Road statistics like these are repeated in state after state, and I believe immediate action must be taken. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill for a number of reasons, the most serious of which is health and safety. From 1992 to 1996, the death rate on South Dakota reservation roads was three times as high as the rate on non-reservation roads. Children who ride buses to school are put at great risk as these buses travel over dilapidated road infrastructure, while ambulances and other emergency vehicles have to be routed around otherwise direct routes to and from emergency situations because of road conditions. The extra moments, even hours added to these emergency runs put human life in jeopardy. No community in this country should be forced to travel on roads as damaged and dangerous as those on reservations in my State. 
Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that my colleague has recognized the national need to improve roads in Indian country. Senator Domenici has developed this legislation in close consultation with Indian leaders, and I am hopeful that the Senate will move the American Indian Transportation Improvement Act forward as quickly as possible.

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to Senate Joint Resolution 1, a version of a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution currently pending before the Senate. 
Throughout the more than 10 years that I have had the honor and opportunity to represent the people of South Dakota as a Congressman and now as a U.S. Senator, I have consistently supported a policy of fiscal prudence and restraint. I have supported, among other initiatives, a line-item veto and enhanced line-item rescission, the 1990 budget agreement initiated by President Bush and the 1993 budget agreement initiated by President Clinton. The latter two budget agreements having played a very significant role in capping discretionary spending, placing our Government on a must-pay-as-you-go basis and contributing to over a 60-percent reduction in the annual Federal budget deficit. I am pleased that these and other efforts taken by the Clinton administration, though almost universally opposed by the Republican congressional caucuses have led to economic growth, prosperity, and now a deficit that is smaller relative to our economy than in any industrial nation on Earth. Even so, we have farther to go to bring our Federal expenditures and revenue into greater equilibrium. To that end, I have also voted in favor of various balanced budget amendments while serving in the other body. 
I do not take the amendment of our Nation's Constitution lightly. I am mindful that this is the legislative body that served as the forum for Clay and for Webster and many other great names of American history. Unlike ordinary legislation, a constitutional amendment cannot be easily changed if it proves faulty--it must be crafted in such a manner that serves the interests of our Nation not only now, but for 200 years and more from now. We must of necessity approach such a difficult task--that of drafting a constitutional amendment for the ages--with some humility and with a full recognition of the great care that is required if future generations are to look to our deliberations with the same respect that we today hold for the Founders of our Republic. 
Over the past 4 years, we, and in particular the Clinton administration, have taken an exploding deficit that had reached nearly $300 billion annually and a cumulative national debt that had quadrupled on the watch of Presidents Reagan and Bush, and cut that annual deficit by over 60 percent. Yet, despite this progress, I began my service in the Senate at the commencement of the 105th Congress with the assumption that I would cast a vote in favor of a constitutional amendment drafted in much the manner that Senate Joint Resolution 1 appears before us today. However, the findings of the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service later substantiated by an analysis of the Office of Management and Budget and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities have cast such grave doubts about the wisdom of Senate Joint Resolution 1 as it is currently drafted, that I cannot cast a vote for an unamended version with the confidence I need to have that it truly will achieve the goals its advocates claim. 
The CRS report makes it clear that Senate Joint Resolution 1 would prohibit the Federal Government from conducting its financial affairs in the same prudent manner that every South Dakota family attempts to achieve. It would effectively prevent the Federal Government from setting aside cash reserves in good times in order to have them available in times of crisis--a policy that flies in the face of common sense and one that certainly should not be imposed on all future generations of Americans. 
While the Social Security trust fund is the source of the greatest attention in this debate, and that is understandable since Senate Joint Resolution 1 would convert the Federal Government's largest effort to set aside resources for a future generation into a virtual fraud on the taxpayers, the implications of denying the Federal Government the ability to raise funds now for future needs goes far beyond damage to Social Security. Such a provision diminishes the usefulness of all our trust funds, especially those that have been designed to gain revenue during good times and to be available to fall back on during bad times. It makes any realistic effort to set aside funds now to be available for a future countercyclical economic strategy much more difficult--a criticism that has been the chief reason why Republican economic experts such as Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, 11 Nobel laureate economists, and even the conservative Wall Street Journal have condemned Senate Joint Resolution 1. 
While a few Members of this body may attempt to lecture me about what pledges I have made to the people of South Dakota during the past campaign, I will refrain from attempting to impugn their motives or to engage in self-righteous assertions about their responsibilities to their constituents or to their oath of office. 
I have pledged to the people of South Dakota that I would support a balanced budget and that I would vote for a balanced budget amendment--one that works--one that would help achieve the goal of balancing the Federal budget without destroying Social Security or otherwise placing our Nation's economic growth and prosperity at great risk. What arrogance for anyone to suggest on this floor that a vote for any proposed amendment other than Senate Joint Resolution 1 constitutes a breach of honor. 
I have voted, and it is duly recorded in the Senate Journal, for a balanced budget amendment and for modifications to Senate Joint Resolution 1 which would promote a balanced budget without the disastrous flaws of Senate Joint Resolution 1. 
I am a fourth generation South Dakotan. My family homesteaded in our State and I'm proud that my children now represent the fifth consecutive generation of our family to claim Clay County, SD as home. With that background, I have a profound appreciation for the concerns and more importantly the values of the citizens of my State. During this past campaign I pledged to them the most important pledge of all--that I would exercise my best judgment and greatest care in casting my vote in the Senate and that in doing so, I would ignore the immediate winds of political pressure and cast my votes in a manner consistent with the long-term needs of our State and Nation. 
There is no doubt that the easy thing for me to do would be to capitulate to the current political pressures ginned up and funded by the special interests promoting exclusively Senate Joint Resolution 1. That would be the path of least resistance, and, clearly, the negative impact of that particular version of balanced budget amendment would not be felt until after my next election where I too choose to run for another term in this body. 
It would take, frankly, several years to ratify any amendment and some years beyond that before the public would fully recognize the enormous wrong this body would have done to the Constitution. But I told my constituents that I would do the right thing, not the politically expedient thing. While I respect the integrity of everyone's professed views, as I look about this Chamber, I have to wonder if there would in fact be a close vote on Senate Joint Resolution 1 if the ballot were secret, and intellect and conscience the only driving forces in this debate. 
Mr. President, when this debate concludes tomorrow, I will have the satisfaction of knowing that I have honorably lived up to my pledges to the people of South Dakota and to my sacred responsibilities to this Nation and to the U.S. Senate. To cast a vote for this specific version of a balanced budget amendment knowing what I know today, would constitute a betrayal of the people of my State, and inasmuch as I am a U.S. Senator, it would be a betrayal of my commitment and my love for our Nation--that I will not and cannot do. 
I yield back the remaining time.

 Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like you to join me in congratulating the accomplishments of a special program that benefits the students, educators, and communities of South Dakota. In 1993, the University of South Dakota [USD] started the Professional Development Center [PDC] with the hope of strengthening the important relationship between rural economic growth and the professional development of teachers. Even those in the PDC had no idea then that, 4 years later, this program would have impacted the State to such a large degree with unlimited potential for the future. 
A career in education is subject to a number of barriers including feelings of isolation as a new teacher and a sense of being stuck in a rut as an experienced teacher. These feelings can influence the overall effectiveness of teachers by not allowing them to achieve their potential as professional educators. The PDC is designed to counter these feelings by pairing first year teachers as interns with more experienced teachers as mentors. In addition, a member of the USD faculty is assigned to each pairing. This arrangement allows for the exchange of ideas, materials, teaching demonstrations, and technologies in a supportive social and professional environment. Interns benefit by learning from talented and experienced peers; mentors are rejuvenated with new ideas; and the university faculty provide both parties with a direct link to the resources and opportunities available at USD. 
The impact of this relationship is felt outside the classroom walls. By creating an environment of shared learning within a community, the PDC empowers teachers to come up with creative educational opportunities for their students and, most importantly, to act on these ideas. In the process of enhancing the curriculum, educators enhance their own professional development. 
Ultimately, the PDC benefits the children and communities of South Dakota the most. Students receive quality instruction and are challenged to develop their own new ideas from motivated teachers. In addition, students are exposed to positive role models in education, encouraging some to pursue a similar career. For their part, communities reap the rewards of an environment with higher educational standards for students, teachers with a strengthened commitment to their profession, and established links to USD. 
Mr. President, the Professional Development Center at the University of South Dakota is a perfect example of a program that enhances communities through education. It is a model for future efforts to improve the overall quality of life in rural America. I invite you to join me in congratulating the following members of the PDC for receiving the Distinguished Program in Teacher Education Award at the recent Association for Teacher Educators conference: University of South Dakota interim president, Dr. Paul Olscamp; dean of the College of Education, Dr. Larry Bright; Dr. Sharon Lee, Dr. Michael Hoadley, Dr. Don Monroe, Dr. Lana Danielson, Dr. Royce Engstrom, Donna Gross, Dr. Sharon Ross, Dr. Rosanne Yost, Dr. Roger Bordeaux, and Mindy Crawford.

Mr. Johnson. Mr. President, I am proud and grateful to be here today as a co-sponsor of The Beast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 1997. I am proud because this bill is the right thing to do--it's a common sense measure that protects women undergoing breast cancer treatments. And I am grateful because, as the husband of a woman who has suffered from breast cancer, I know that every step makes a difference in preserving and protecting the quality of life for those afflicted with this disease. 
As health care costs spiral out of control, more and more decisions are being made based on the bottom-line rather than on the needs of the patient. A twenty-four hour stay is not always long enough for a mother and newborn child. And a twenty-four hour stay is often not long enough for a woman who has undergone surgical treatment for breast cancer. 
I know this not just from literature or fact sheets or discussions with health care professionals. I know that twenty-four hours isn't long enough for everyone because I helped my wife home from the hospital after her cancer surgery. With tubes running everywhere, we brought her into our home twenty-two hours after her surgery. Many families aren't equipped to give the care needed. And many women aren't well enough to give themselves the care needed. An additional twenty-four hours in the hospital can decrease the risk of infection, allow women to rest more comfortably, and ensure that any crucial health care decision is being made in the best possible environment. 
My wife and I are not alone. Nearly one out of every eight women will develop breast cancer. Approximately, 185,000 women will be diagnosed with the disease this year. Sadly, more than 44,000 women will also die from this disease in the next 365 days. The numbers of those afflicted with this disease must decrease, but the options must increase. 
These are our grandmothers, our mothers, our daughters, our sisters, our wives. They deserve the best that we can give. 
This bill does not do it all, but, as we look for a cure and other innovative treatments, it is part of a package to ease the pain of this invasive disease. I will do all that I can to make sure this bill becomes law.
