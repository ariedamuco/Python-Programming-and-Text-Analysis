   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would be happy to have a brief discussion with Chairman STEVENS on this matter. As he knows, on many occasions I have expressed to my colleagues in this Chamber my strong opposition to gambling in the Hawaiian Islands. Our State of Hawaii is one of only two states in the entire country that prohibits gambling of all kinds. When Federal laws, including the Gambling Devices Transportation Act, more commonly known as the Johnson Act, affecting the ability of cruise ships to conduct gambling operations were relaxed over the past decade, I was involved in drafting those provisions to be sure that the longstanding Federal prohibition against the possession and operation of gambling devices be maintained with respect to the State of Hawaii. Unfortunately, I understand that a foreign cruise line seeks to exploit a loophole in Federal law and circumvent this long standing prohibition. This legislation closes this loophole. 
   This recent announcement by a foreign cruise line--that is substantially owned by foreign gambling interests--to permanently based a large cruise ship with an extensive casino on board in Hawaii for year-round operation on cruises that will begin and end in Honolulu has prompted this amendment. This amendment ensure that there is no ambiguity in the intent of the Johnson Act's application to the State of Hawaii by expressly preserving the act's original prohibition of the transportation, possession, repair, and use of any gambling devices aboard vessels that embark and disembark passengers in the State of Hawaii, as defined in 19 C.F.R. 4.80a(a)4. 
   I want to make clear to my colleagues that this provision would not affect any State other than Hawaii. Moreover, it would not prohibit current gambling operations on board cruise ships that, for example, begin or end their cruises on the mainland or in foreign countries, even if they call at multiple ports in Hawaii, so long as the gambling facilities are closed when the vessel is in Hawaii and the passengers do not begin and end their trip in Hawaii. Passengers could either begin or end their trip in the State, but could not do both. A vessel that is operating in dedicated service in Hawaii, however, cannot escape the Johnson Act's broad prohibitions simply by calling at Christmas Island or some other similar foreign port. 
   I have made clear that I do not want gambling in Hawaii many time and in particular on the occasions that we have debated the Johnson Act and gambling on cruise ships. I have been unwavering in my position that gambling on voyages beginning and ending in Hawaii will not be accepted practice. This provision should clarify any ambiguity in the Johnson Act as to what types of gambling operations on board vessels are allowed and not allowed in Hawaii. I can assure my colleagues that if gambling interests believe they can exploit and circumvent the spirit and intent of Federal laws prohibiting gambling in Hawaii, I will be back in this Chamber to attempt to make the necessary changes to continue our State's longstanding prohibition on such activities.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in 1992, Congress enacted legislation regulating the cable industry because of the lack of competition and the resulting high rates. In 1996, Congress anticipating that competition would replace regulation in restraining prices, passed legislation terminating the FCC's right to regulate the price of basic cable in March 1999. Unfortunately, competition has not emerged as fully as I would have liked. According to the FCC's latest report only 157 communities out of 33,000 communities across America have ``effective competition.'' In fact, in many communities in Hawaii, consumers have no cable service at all. 
   Northpoint Technology and its Broadwave affiliates want to provide low cost multi-channel video and data services in every television market in the United States. Therefore, it is critical that Congress and the FCC take the actions necessary to resolve sharing and other technical and policy issues quickly with respect to the applications of the Broadwave affiliates. Furthermore, these applications are subject to a Congressional mandate (Section 2002 of S. 1948, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act) that requires the FCC by November 29, 2000 to grant or deny applications such as those of the Broadwave affiliates, that can provide television service in rural areas. The technical sharing analysis required by the ``Launching Our Communities' Access to Local Television Act of 2000'' does not obviate the legislative obligation imposed by S. 1948. Therefore, the FCC should do whatever is necessary to meet its November 29, 2000 obligations.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this month marks the 65th anniversary of the world's first commercial trans-Pacific flight. I wish to pay tribute to those who possessed the vision and tenacity to achieve this historic milestone, which significantly altered the travel industry, mail service, and cargo service, and forever change my home state of Hawaii. 
   On November 22, 1935, Pan American World Airways' China Clipper traveled from San Francisco to Manila. This feat was remarkable for many reasons, including the following: 
   This inaugural fight was the longest ocean-spanning flight in history. The China Clipper traveled 8,746 miles and completed the one-way route in six days. Prior to this flight, the longest over-water flight was a 1,865-mile journey from Dakar in French West Africa to Natal, Brazil, in South America. 
   This aircraft delivered the first airmail across the Pacific ocean. It carried 110,865 letters weighing a total of 1,837 pounds. 
   This China Clipper, an M-130 aircraft built by G. L. Martin Company specifically to meet the demands of this trans-oceanic flight, was the largest flying boat ever. 
   About 125,000 people cheered as the four-engine China Clipper taxied out of a harbor in San Francisco Bay and headed for the Philippines. They watched from vantage points along the shore and the still-under-construction Golden Gate Bridge, and aboard recreational boats and small private planes. Postmaster General James A. Farley traveled from Washington, D.C. to witness this inaugural event and President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent a special message conveying his heartfelt congratulations. 
   The China Clipper made stops at several Pacific Islands. On November 23, 1935, its arrival in Oahu's Pearl Harbor was watched by about 3,000 people. Then the aircraft continued on, making stops at Pan American bases at Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam. The China Clipper brought the staffs at these bases 12 crates of turkeys, and cartons of cranberries, sweet potatoes, and mincemeat. The meals represented these islands' first Thanksgiving celebrations. 
   The China Clipper's brave crew of seven were: Captain Edwin C. Musick, First Officer R. O. D. Sullivan, Second Officer George King, First Engineering Officer Chan Wright, Engineering Officer Victor Wright, Navigation Officer Fred Noonan, and Radio Officer W. T. Jarboe, Jr. 
   Captain Musick's own description of the landing at Wake Island, a barren atoll, offers a glimpse of what it was like to be aboard the China Clipper's inaugural trans-Pacific flight. According to Captain Musick, the landing was the ``most difficult'' on the trip and ``called for the most exacting feats of navigation on record.'' It was like striking a point that was ``smaller than a pinhead'' in the ``vast map of the Pacific Ocean.'' 
   On November 29, 1935, the China Clipper landed in Manila and on December 6, it arrived in San Francisco to complete the round trip. Although the aircraft did not carry any paying passengers, its journey marked the beginning of trans-oceanic passenger commercial aviation. 
   Eleven months later, on October 21, 1936, Pan American inaugurated a passenger service route with stops in San Francisco, Honolulu, and Manila. The four-engine China Clippers cruised at 150 miles per hour. Passengers, who sat in broad armchairs and ate their meals with fine china and silverware, paid $1,438 for a round trip from San Francisco to Manila. The airlines purchased six Boeing B-314 aircraft to add to its Pacific-route fleet. 
   Thirty years later, the advent of the jet age brought Hawaii--located approximately 2,400 miles from the nearest major port--closer to the rest of  the world. In 1967, visitor arrivals jumped 34.6 percent to 1.1 million tourists from the previous year when the first jets arrived in Hawaii. By 1968, Continental Airlines, Western Air, Braniff International, American Airlines, Trans World Airlines, Inc., and United Airlines had joined Pan Am in flying Hawaii-Mainland routes. Today, Honolulu International Airport is home to about 40 carriers. In recent years, the state's annual visitor count has approached 7 million tourists. 
   The China Clipper also paved the way for the export of Hawaii's agricultural products, such as pineapples and flowers. The Hawaii floriculture industry's out-of-state sales each year are about $40 million. The timely export of these perishable goods is made possible by aviation. 
   Today, agriculture and tourism are mainstays of Hawaii's economy. The China Clipper's crew and Juan Trippe, who was president of Pan American at the time of the inaugural flight, would marvel at the economic and social ramifications of that historic journey more than six decades ago. 
   I salute the people of Pan American World Airways, G. L. Martin Company, and Boeing who pursued what others thought was impossible. It is my hope that today's aviation industry will follow the example of its forebears by continually striving to achieve new milestones in safety, efficiency, and customer service.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to thank Senators SNOWE, KERRY and HOLLINGS for their dedicated efforts in support of this important measure and engage in a discussion of certain provisions of S. 1482, the National Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 2000. 
   Since its creation in 1972, the National Marine Sanctuary Program has successfully protected our nation's unique marine resources through a deliberative process that has allowed affected citizens to help shape the future of the protected resources. The Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary is an excellent example of how divergent interests came together to develop a plan for the protection of the unique marine resources of this area. 
   We now have a new opportunity to enhance the protection of another unique Hawaiian resource--the coral reef ecosystem surrounding the Northwestern Hawaiian Island (NWHI). In May of this year, President Clinton expressed his desire to provide strong and lasting protection for the coral reef ecosystem of the NWHI, and directed the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce, in cooperation with the State of Hawaii and in consultation with the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (WESPAC), to develop recommendations for ``a new, coordinated management regime to increase protection for the coral reef ecosystem'' of the NWHI. 
   I agree with the President that there should be strong and lasting protection for the coral reef ecosystem of the NWHI. I also believe that it is critical to ensure meaningful public input on the nature of actions to be taken and to foster public support for these lasting protections. 
   Prior to the President's announcement, the Commerce Department already had a solid head start in efforts to identify and evaluate actions to protect the resources of the NWHI in developing the first ever ecosystem level fishery management plan. This Coral Reef Ecosystem Fisheries Management Plan, which identifies a series of actions such as ``no-take'' closures for coral and monk seal protection, was subject to extensive public comment and is now undergoing departmental internal review. 
   To complement this ongoing effort, the sanctuary program is well equipped to achieve the President's goals while ensuring meaningful public participation. Accordingly, S. 1482 would trigger an immediate process for designating a sanctuary in the NWHI. In the interim, to accommodate President Clinton's desire to implement protections without delay, S. 1482 would authorize the President, after consulting with the Governor of the State of Hawaii, to designate any coral reef ecosystem area in the NWHI as a coral reef reserve, and establish a Coral Reef Reserve Advisory Council to work with the Secretary of Commerce in developing a long-range and lasting plan to protect the living marine resources of the NWHI. The Coral Reef Reserve area would ultimately become part of any sanctuary established in the NWHI. 
   The Dry Tortugas Ecological Reserve and Natural Resource area off the Florida Keys is in many ways similar to what is being proposed for the Northwestern Hawaiians Islands. However, the Dry Tortugas process benefited from an extensive public process which ensured community concerns were heard and addressed. As a result of this process, there is now widespread support for this ecological reserve. 
   I am concerned about the administration's interest in immediately establishing, without any public input, areas around the NWHI within which all activities are permanently prohibited except for Native Hawaiian access and subsistence. This could mean that all other activities, including commercial and recreational access and possibly certain defense activities, would be prohibited within these areas forever. Whatever protections the administration feels are necessary should be subject to review during the course of the sanctuary designation process. Even the Administration's U.S. Coral Reef Task Force contemplated a deliberative process when it recommended the goal of achieving at least 20 percent protection by the year 2010.

   Mr. INOUYE. Yes, in addition to the evaluation process provided for in the designation, the legislation ensures that such a 5-year review would take place. While we know enough about the area to understand the need to protect it, we will know far more about it in 5 years. In conjunction with the development of a Sanctuary the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is already mapping and assessing the coral ecosystem of this area, and evaluating the status of its living marine resources. It will be important to use this information to evaluate whether the management of the area under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, in conjunction with other marine conservation laws, is adequate.

   Mr. INOUYE. Yes I do, and I would support such closures, as well as taking aggressive action to address the terrible problem of marine debris in the NWHI, which is harming both the corals and our endangered monk seals. Furthermore, I believe it may be appropriate to identify further precautionary actions that our scientists tell us may be necessary to prevent future harm to these resources. However, no action should be taken on these proposals until they can be evaluated publicly by the people of Hawaii.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the year 2000 marks an occasion that is worthy of recognition by the Senate. The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii celebrates its sesquicentennial, marking the 150th anniversary of its first meeting, on October 15, 1850, of a group of Honolulu businessmen at the behest of Hawaii's King Kamehameha III. They founded the Hawaiian Chamber of Commerce, an organization that would lead the Hawaiian Islands' growth in trade, commerce, economic and social development through the years. The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii is the second-oldest chamber of commerce west of the Rockies, and the only American chamber founded under a monarchy. 
   The history of The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii includes many, many accomplishments. I wish to provide a glimpse of their more notable achievements which I believe merit recognition. 
   In 1867, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii initiated negotiations for the first treaty of reciprocity in trade between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Hawaii. 
   The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii authored the Hawaiian National Banking Act of 1884, allowing the establishment of the banking system that has evolved into Hawaii's current system. 
   In 1898, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii began its successful advocacy for a Hawaii-San Francisco TransPacific cable. 
   The Hawaii Visitors Bureau, today known as the Hawaii Visitors and Conventions Bureau, was founded by the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii in 1903. This agency has led the development of Hawaii's visitor industry, which today is the largest sector of Hawaii's economy. 
   In 1907, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii conducted a survey of the Pearl River to facilitate the construction of a harbor and dry dock that is now Pearl Harbor. The United States Pacific Command today provides a strong, forward based U.S. defense in the Asia-Pacific region from this great harbor. 
   In 1919, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii founded Aloha United Way, Hawaii's leading charitable organization which annually collects millions of dollars for the needy in Hawaii. 
   The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii became the trustee of Hawaii's Public Health Fund in 1923. The Public Health Fund provides seed money for approximately 20 public health projects each year. 
   In 1928, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii's aviation committee sought out airlines to provide the first interisland air service. 
   In 1929, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii drafted a plan to increase the depth of Honolulu Harbor to accommodate modern ships and facilitate international trade. Today, Honolulu Harbor is our primary port of entry for the vast majority of all goods to Hawaii. 
   In 1941. The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii founded the Blood Bank of Hawaii. Later that year, the services of the Blood Bank helped to save many lives when Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7th, 1941. 
   The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii was an active and vocal advocate for statehood for Hawaii. In 1959, The Chamber joined other local advocates in celebrating Hawaii's statehood. 
   In 1978, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii played a leading role in Hawaii's State Constitutional Convention. 
   Throughout its 150-year history, and continuing today, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii has helped to support a strong U.S. economic and military presence in the Asia-Pacific region. As the economies of the region grow, The Chamber's continued support for a strong, forward based military presence that provides the stability prerequisite to prosperity will be important. The Chamber's continued work to promote economic development in the region will play a vital role in aiding the goals and interests of Hawaii and the United States in the Asia-Pacific region. 
   Congratulations to The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii on its 150th anniversary, and best wishes for continued success in the years ahead.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as the 106th Congress draws to a close, I stand to pay tribute to a distinguished Navy officer who served as a Congressional Science Detail on my staff during this Congress. Commander Catherine Wilson, United States Navy, was selected for this highly coveted position as a result of her outstanding training, experience, and accomplishments. Her superb performance and impeccable credentials earned her the respect and admiration of the Senate staff. She distinguished herself rapidly as a professional who possessed a pleasant demeanor, tremendous integrity, decisive  leadership style, political savvy, and unending energy. The ultimate Naval officer, Commander Wilson is a visionary thinker who has the innate ability to implement these visions. Commander Wilson is the consummate professional and nursing has never had a better ambassador nor patients a more devoted advocate. 
   Commander Wilson forged strong alliances and affiliations with staff from a myriad of Congressional offices, committees, and federal and civilian agencies that fostered a cohesive approach to legislative proposals. She worked closely with staff members on the Appropriations Subcommittees on Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services and Education in support of military health issues and national nursing and health care agendas. 
   As an advocate of Tri-Service nursing and military health issues, Commander Wilson championed independent practice for nurse anesthetists, the continuation of the Bachelor of Science degree as the minimum level of education for entry into military nursing practice, continued funding for a graduate school of nursing at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and the Tri-Service Nursing Research Program. She was instrumental in securing appropriations language for a wide variety of health care initiatives including telemedicine, advanced medical technologies, and distance learning. 
   More than fifty years ago, as I was recovering in a military hospital, I began a unique relationship with military nurses. Commander Wilson embodies what I know military nurses to be--strong, dedicated professional leaders stepping to the forefront to serve our country and committed to caring for our Sailors, Marines, Airmen, Soldiers, and their family members during peacetime and at war. 
   Commander Wilson is an officer of whom the military and our nation can and should be justifiably proud: a unique combination of talent and devotion to duty. I want to personally acknowledge my sincere appreciation to Commander Wilson for her exemplary months of service, and to bid her a fond aloha and heartfelt mahalo.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor Dr. Faye G. Abdellah, RN, Ed.D., Sc.D., FAAN who is currently serving as the Dean of the Graduate School of Nursing at the Uniformed Services University. Dr. Abdellah will be inducted in the National Women's Hall of Fame this weekend. Founded in 1969, the Hall is a national membership organization in Seneca Falls, New York that honors and celebrates the achievements of American women. She will join a list of 157 of the most distinguished women in American history, including Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, Helen Keller, Sandra Day O'Connor, Rosa Parks, and Eleanor Roosevelt. Dr. Abdellah is being recognized and honored for her pioneering work altering nursing theory and practice, for the development of the first tested coronary care unit that saved thousands of lives, and for being the first nurse to hold the rank of Rear Admiral (Upper Half) and the title of Deputy Surgeon General for the United States. 
   Dr. Abdellah is the recipient of 79 professional and academic honors. She holds eleven honorary degrees from universities that have recognized her innovative work in nursing research, in the development of the first nurse scientist, as an international expert in health policies, and for making invaluable contributions to the health of our nation. She has authored and co-authored more than 150 publications, some of which have been translated into six languages. 
   Dr. Abdellah worked with the Surgeon General in the formation of national health policies related to AIDS, drug addiction, violence, smoking and alcoholism. She developed the first federal training program for health services researchers, health services administrators and geriatric nurse practitioners. Dr. Abdellah has worked with state and district nursing associations, serving on many work groups and committees developing standards of nursing practice, credentialing activities, and providing workshops in nursing research. 
   As part of her international health outreach role as a nurse and health services consultant, she has been a member of official United States delegations on exchange missions to Russia, Yugoslavia, and France, and designated as coordinator for nursing for the United States-Argentina Cooperation in Health and Medical Research Project. Dr. Abdellah has also served as a consultant to the Japanese Nursing Association on nursing education and research on three separate occasions. 
   I have had the privilege of knowing Dr. Abdellah for many years. Her selfless devotion to duty and extraordinary accomplishments are legendary. It is with pride that I congratulate Dr. Abdellah on her well-deserved induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Our nation can be proud of her long and distinguished service to this country.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the estate tax imposes a true hardship on family-owned businesses. When a person dies, the estate tax must be paid within 9 months. Current law permits only a small number of business owners to pay the estate tax in installments. The tax for most closely held businesses, however, must be paid shortly after the owners' death. Often, business assets and even the business itself must be sold to raise the cash to pay the tax. Closely held businesses, however, cannot be sold for their true value within so short a time. To avoid such fire sales, elderly owners will often sell their businesses while still living to get a fair price. 
   Congress, as a matter of policy, should encourage the formation of family businesses and also support their continuation. The estate tax measures that the Senate recently voted on do not fully or immediately respond to the problems of closely held, family-owned businesses. Due to revenue constraints, repeal of the estate tax must be slowly phased in. During that phase-in period, whether the tax rate is 45 percent, 35 percent, 25 percent, or 15 percent, many business owners will still need to liquidate their businesses to pay the tax. 
   The alternative proposal to raise the deduction for qualified family-owned business interests to $2 million fails to answer the basic liquidity problem. These families have all their assets tied up in their businesses. They do not have the cash to pay the estate tax right away. Moreover, the strict eligibility rules and caps restrict the number of family businesses that can qualify for the QFOBI deduction. The 10-year recapture rule, which is also part of the alternative proposal, also hampers the businesses that do qualify. 
   The bill that I and Senator AKAKA introduce today would make all closely held businesses eligible for temporary deferral and installment payment of the estate tax. My measure simply raises the number of permissible owners for qualifying closely held businesses from 15 to 75, thereby expanding eligibility for the 4-year deferral and 10-year installment payment of the estate tax. 
   In the subchapter S Act of 1958, the Senate established special income tax rules for closely held businesses. The Senate in the same legislation also decided to collect the estate tax on closely held businesses over an extended payment period. By being allowed to pay the estate tax on the family businesses over 10 annual installments after an initial 4-year deferral, the surviving family members can continue to operate these businesses and use future earnings to pay the estate tax. 
   In 1996, Congress amended subchapter S to allow a small business corporation to have up to 75 owners; this was intended to encourage closely held businesses to give key workers a share in ownership. But the eligibility rules were not changed for estate tax payment. By sharing ownership with workers as encouraged under the 1996 amendments to subchapter S, the owners of closely held businesses lose their estate tax relief. Although these businesses still qualify under subchapter S, they are often no longer eligible for temporary deferral and extended installment payment of the estate tax. 
   The Treasury Department suggests that the qualification rules for subchapter S and for estate tax relief should be made consistent once again. During the debate on estate tax relief, Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN acknowledged this problem and pledged to correct it. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow Cooperative Housing Corporations (Co-ops) to convert to condominium forms of ownership without any immediate tax consequences. 
   Under current law, a conversion from cooperative shareholding to condominium ownership is taxable at a corporate level as well as an individual level. The conversion is treated as a corporate liquidation, and therefore taxed accordingly. In addition, a capital gains tax is levied on any increase between the owner's basis in the co-op share pre-conversion and the market value of the condominium interest post-conversion. This double taxation dissuades condominium conversion because the owner is being taxed on a transaction that is nothing more than a change in the form of ownership. While the Internal Revenue Service concedes that there are no discernible advantages to society from the cooperative form of ownership, it does not view Federal tax statutes as having the flexibility to allow co-ops to re-organize freely as condominiums. 
   In cooperative housing, real property ownership is vested in a corporation, with shares of stock for each apartment unit, that are sold to buyers. The corporation then issues a proprietary lease entitling the owner of the stock to the use of the unit in perpetuity. Because the investment is in the form of a share of stock, investors sometimes lose their entire investment as a result of debt incurred by the corporation in construction and development. In addition, due to the structure of a cooperative housing corporation, a prospective purchaser of shares in the corporation from an existing tenant-stockholder has difficulty obtaining mortgage financing for the purchase. Furthermore, tenant-stockholders of cooperative housing also encounter difficulties in securing bank loans for the full value of their investment. 
   As a result, owners of cooperative housing are increasingly looking toward conversion to condominium ownership regimes. Condominium ownership permits each owner of a unit to directly own the unit itself, eliminating the cooperative housing dilemmas of corporate debt that supersedes the investment of cooperative housing share owners, and other financial concerns. 
   The legislation I introduce today will remove the penalty of double taxation from the cooperative housing to condominium ownership, and will greatly benefit co-op owners across the Nation. I urge my colleagues' consideration and support for this measure.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I want to begin by informing the Senate that, at $287.9 billion, this act represents the largest defense spending measure in history. 
   The act is $176 million more than was recommended by the Senate and $706 million below the House level. 
   The conference agreement is a fair compromise between the two Houses. Funding for many items of priority of each of the bodies have been included, but concessions were also required of each Chamber. 
   Our chairman and his House counterpart should be given great credit for this measure. 
   I am confident the funding contained in this act will allow our military to meet their most critical readiness and modernization needs in the coming year. 
   However, Senators should be advised that the bill does not provide a blank check to the Pentagon. 
   It includes reductions in some programs that, such as in the Navy's LPD-17, are behind schedule, over budget, or simply not ready to proceed. 
   In addition, the conferees concurred with the House, terminating the Discoverer II and Sadarm programs. 
   Mr. President, these were difficult decisions, but by making these tough choices the conferees were able to identify sufficient resources to protect those programs which are truly critical to the support of our military forces. 
   I want to assure my colleagues that the No. 1 priority in this bill is to protect near-term readiness. 
   The men and women willing to go into harm's way to protect the rest of us simply must be provided the tools they need to defeat any threat. 
   To help meet our readiness requirements, the conference agreement includes the following among its many accomplishments:

Mr. President, the statement of the managers to accompany the conference report on H.R. 4576 included a table to delineate the projects recommended for funding in the Defense Health Program. Unfortunately, the information included in the Congressional Record and printed in House Report 106-754 deleted one line from the recommended list of projects. To clarify the agreement of the conferees, I ask unanimous consent that a table taken from a copy of the official papers which lists the actual agreement be printed in the Record.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, at my request, the conferees added a $2 million item to match a program that the House had included. This program, under the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Navy Appropriation, is listed under the Human Systems Technology Program as ``Maritime Fire Training/Barber's Point''. 
   This funding is to be available to enhance the ability of the Department of Defense to meet its civilian crewing demand and assist in maintaining a cadre of qualified seafarers for times of national emergencies. 
   The Department of Defense is facing a significantly smaller pool of Merchant Mariners than existed in the past. In recent Senate testimony, Vice Admiral Gordon Holder, Commander of the Military Sealift Command, identified the issue of Merchant Mariner availability as a key issue to his command. Admiral Holder testified that ``MSC's difficulty in recruiting and retaining a professional cadre of civil service merchant mariners also extends to the U.S. Commercial Merchant Fleet.'' Moreover, a recent study by the National Defense Transportation Association has identified potential merchant mariner shortages. The new requirements of the standards of training, certification, and watchkeeping will have an impact on our ability to maintain a qualified pool of seafarers.  
   The Pacific Theater is the fastest growing sector for civilian U.S. Merchant Mariners, with at least 2,500 civilian seafaring jobs coming online over the next three years. To assist the Department of Defense in meeting its civilian merchant mariner requirements, the conferees provided this funding. It is contemplated that the funds will be used for a maritime fire training facility at the Hawaii National Guard Facilities at Barber's Point. The facility will be used to train service component and civilian merchant mariners.

   Mr. INOUYE. I concur in the views of my colleagues, and add that the 1994 Act has been implemented without the benefit of any regulations for the past six years. Accordingly, I can imagine no undue hardship would come to the Department if the final regulations are silent as to eight of the hundreds of issues addressed in the draft regulations. As to these eight so-called ``impasse'' issues, I would encourage the  Department to simply not issue any regulatory provisions that touch upon these objectionable issues. As I understand it, the ninety-five percent of the remaining regulations that deal with other issues are acceptable to the Indian tribes. The Department should publish those as final and withhold from publication of the eight provisions that are objectionable. I would inquire of the Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs as to the nature of the eight objectionable provisions.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I agree with Senator NICKLES that Congress should have oversight of this issue and that decisions made about the research station should be made based on the merits of the work performed there rather than political considerations. 
   If one day Fort Reno is declared surplus or excess property by USDA, I hope that the Cheyenne and Arapaho's interest in the land will be considered. I believe they have a legitimate case in their pursuit of that land, and I look forward to working further with Senator NICKLES on this issue.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I would like to offer a special tribute to the oldest university student exchange forum between Japan and the United States, the Japan-America Student Conference (JASC). Founded sixty-six years ago at the initiative of a group of Japanese students who were concerned about deteriorating U.S.-Japan relations, the month-long Conference has since convened on fifty-two annual occasions, alternating between the two countries. 
   This year, the Conference will open on July 21st at Tokai University's Honolulu campus, then move on to the University of North Carolina, Washington, DC, and New York City, and will conclude at the Reischauser Institute for Japanese Studies at Harvard University on August 21st. The sixty-two delegates, half from each country and, representing some thirty-four university campuses, will address such topics as: business practices, environmental issues, philosophy and religion, historical perspectives, and third world policies, against the thematic backdrop of ``Developing New Approaches to Promote Social Change.'' 
   JASC is completely designed and implemented by students. Delegates elect Japanese and American Executive Committees at the conclusion of each Conference who manage, plan, and select delegates for the next year's event. Many alumni of the conference have gone on to distinguish themselves in the business, academic, and governmental arenas of their respective societies. Most notable among them is Kiichi Miyazawa, former Prime Minister and current Finance Minister of Japan, who participated in the 1939 and 1940 Conferences, and Henry Kissinger, former U.S. Secretary of State, who participated in the 1951 Conference. A common denominator among the highly diverse delegate community is a deep interest in knowing more about the U.S. and Japan, which can lead to careers relevant to the bilateral relationship. 
   Thirty intense days of travel and dialogue with each other foster better understanding and trust between the cultures, and, more importantly, friendships that endure for decades. As one delegate observed, ``JASC is not a destination; it is a journey that does not conclude.''

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, resolving Indian trust management issues should be one of the foremost priorities of this Congress. Ever since the passage of the Dawes Act in 1887, serious problems have plagued the Federal government's trust management efforts. Due to recent congressional interest and support, the Department of the Interior has been able to make significant progress in reforming its trust management systems. Working in collaboration, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of the Special Trustee are: 
   Instituting a national, state of the art, trust asset management system; 
   Implementing a revised Trust Management Improvement Project High Level Implementation Plan; and 
   Instituting improvements in systems, operations, and policies that will help ensure that the Federal government meets its fiduciary obligations to Indian Tribes and individual American Indians. 
   The subcommittee's efforts to provide full funding for the Trust Management Improvement Project under the Office of the Special Trustee should be applauded. However, I am very concerned that the Senate mark does not fully fund the Bureau of Indian Affair's trust services programs. All of our efforts to reform trust management could become meaningless if BIA can't sustain these reforms by providing the funding and staffing to properly manage the trust land that produces trust income, to produce accurate and timely land title information, and provide timely closing of long open estates. 
   I would like to work with the gentleman from Washington, Senator GORTON, and other concerned members, as the budget process continues, to provide additional resources for BIA's trust programs if funds become available.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator AKAKA, and I wish to engage the floor managers of the bill--the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, and the ranking member, Senator MOYNIHAN--in a discussion on the eventual compromise for estate tax relief. 
   As the distinguished floor managers and all Senators are well aware, the present strategy in this election year is for the Senate to pass H.R. 8 without any change. The majority will vote down all amendments and pass the bill in the exact form as received from the House. the Senate can thus avoid a conference with the House and send the bill immediately to the President to be vetoed. 
   The President repeatedly has said that he will veto H.R. 8 in its present form. But the President has added that he is willing to work with the Congress on a bipartisan basis to enact appropriate estate tax relief for small businesses and family farms. So, if any estate tax relief is to be enacted this year, it will occur as part of an eventual compromise on an omnibus legislative, tax, and spending package in September. 
   Senator AKAKA and I have raised with the distinguished floor managers the need to expand eligibility for deferral and installment payment of the estate tax. 
   Current law allows qualifying estates a 4-year deferral followed by 10-year installment payment of the estate tax liability arising from certain qualified interests in closely held businesses. The estate tax is not avoided or reduced but only deferred. The Treasury will receive the same amount of tax with a discounted rate of interest, but the family gets a longer period to pay the tax. This relief has proven successful in that closely held and family businesses can continue to operate and keep their workers employed while using business earnings to pay off the estate taxes. 
   The present deferral and installment payment relief was part of the Subchapter S Act of 1958. Congress in that Act used the same eligibility requirement for Subchapter S tax treatment of closely held businesses and for estate tax relief. Years later, eligibility was broadened for qualification under Subchapter S, but not for estate tax relief. Current eligibility for estate tax relief is too narrowly restricted. 
   When the expected year-end negotiations between Congress and the President turn to estate tax relief, would the distinguished bill managers seek to widen eligibility for deferral and installment payment for closely held businesses?

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today as I have in prior years to oppose the amendment proposed by my colleague, Senator SESSIONS, related to Indian gaming. 
   I have had the privilege of serving on the Committee on Indian Affairs for 20 years now. 
   Over the course of that time, I have learned a little bit about the state of Indian country, and the pervasive poverty which is both the remnant and result of too many years of failed Federal policies 
   There was a time in our history when the native people of this land thrived. 
   They lived in a state of optimum health. 
   They took from the land and the water only those resources that were necessary to sustain their well-being. 
   They were the first stewards of the environment, and those who later came here, found this continent in pristine condition because of their wise stewardship. 
   Even after the advent of European contact, most tribal groups continued their subsistence way of life. 
   Their culture and religion sustained them. 
   They had sophisticated forms of government. 
   It was so sophisticated and so clearly efficient and effective over many centuries, that our Founding Fathers could find no other better form of government upon which to structure the government of our new Nation. 
   So they adopted the framework of the Iroquois Confederacy--a true democracy--and it is upon that foundation that we have built this great Nation. 
   Unfortunately, there came a time in our history when those in power decided that the native people were an obstacle, and obstruction to the new American way of life and later, to the westward expansion of the United States. 
   So our Nation embarked upon a course of terminating the Indians by exterminating them through war and the distribution of blankets infested with smallpox. 
   We very nearly succeeded in wiping them out. 
   Anthropologists and historians estimate that there were anywhere from 10 to 50 million indigenous people occupying this continent at the time of European contact. 
   By 1849, when the United States finally declared and end to the era known as the Indian Wars, we had managed to so effectively decimate the Indian population that there were a bare 250,000 native people remaining. 
   Having failed in that undertaking, we next proceeded to round up those who survived, forcibly marched them away from their traditional lands and across the country. 
   Not surprisingly, these forced marches--and there were many of these ``trails of tears''--further reduced the Indian population because many died along the way. 
   Later, we found the most inhospitable areas of the country on which to relocate the native people, and expected them to scratch out a living there. 
   Of course, we made some promises along the way: 
   That in exchange for the cession by the tribes of millions of acres of land to the United States, we would provide them with education and health care and shelter. 
   We told them, often in solemn treaties, that these new lands would be theirs in perpetuity--that their traditional way of life would be protected from encroachment by non-Indians and that we would recognize their inherent right as sovereigns to retain all powers of government not relinquished. 
   Their rights to hunt and fish and gather food, to use the waters that were necessary to sustain life on a reservation and the natural resources, were also recognized as preserved in perpetuity to their use. 
   But over the years, these promises and others were broken by our National Government, and our vacillations in policies--of which there were many--left most reservation communities in economic ruin. 
   It might interest my colleagues in the Senate to know that the Government of the United States entered into 800 treaties with Indian nations, sovereign nations. Of the 800 treaties, 470 were filed. I presume they are still filed in some of our cabinets. Three hundred seventy were ratified. Of the 370 treaties ratified by this Senate, we found it necessary to violate provisions in every single one of them. 
   The cumulative effects of our treatment of the native people of this land have proven to be nearly fatal to them. 
   Poverty in Indian country is unequaled anywhere else in the United States. 
   The desperation and despair which inevitably accompanies the pervasive economic devastation that is found in Indian country accounts for the astronomically high rates of suicide and mortality from diseases. 
   Within this context, along comes an opportunity for some tribal governments to explore the economic potential of gaming. 
   It doesn't prove to be a panacea, but it begins to bring in revenues that tribal communities haven't had before. 
   And then the State of California enters the picture by bringing a legal action against the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians--a case that ultimately makes it to the Supreme Court. 
   Consistent with 150 years of Federal law and constitutional principles, the Supreme Court rules that the State of California cannot exercise its jurisdiction on Indian lands to regulate gaming activities. 
   This is in May 1987, and in the aftermath of the Court's ruling, attention turns to the Congress. 
   Mr. President, it was now in the 100th session of the Congress that I found myself serving as the primary sponsor of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. 
   There were many hearings and many drafts leading up to the formulation of the bill that was ultimately signed into law. 
   Intially, our inclination was to follow the well-established and time-honored model of Federal Indian law--which was to provide for an exclusive Federal presence in the regulation of gaming activities on Indian lands. 
   Such a framework would be consistent with constitutional principles, with the majority of our Federal statutes addressing Indian country, and would reflect the fact that as a general proposition--it is Federal law, along with tribal law, that governs most all of what may transpire in Indian country. 
   But representatives of several States came to the Congress--demanding a role in the regulation of Indian gaming--and ultimately, we acquiesced to those demands. 
   We selected a mechanism that has become customary in the dealings amongst sovereign governments. 
   This mechanism--a compact between a State government and a tribal government--would be recognized by the Federal Government as the agreement between the two sovereigns as to how the conduct of gaming on Indian lands would proceed. 
   This Federal recognition of the agreement would be accompanied when the Secretary of the Department of the Interior approved the tribal-State compact. 
   In an effort to assure that the parties would come to the table and negotiate a compact in good faith, and in order to provide for the possibility that the parties might not reach agreement, we also provided a means by which the parties could seek the involvement of a Federal district court, and if ordered by the court, could avail themselves of a mediation process. 
   That judicial remedy and the potential for a mediated solution when the parties find themselves at an impasse has subsequently been frustrated by a ruling of the Supreme Court upholding the 11th amendment immunity of the several States. 
   Thus, while there are some who have consistently maintained that sovereign immunity is an anachronism in contemporary times, in this area at least, the States still jealously guard their sovereign immunity to suit in the courts of another sovereign. 
   In so doing, the States have presented us with a clear conflict, which we have been trying to resolve for several years. 
   Although 24 of the 28 States that have Indian reservations within their boundaries have now entered into 159 tribal-State compacts with 148 tribal governments, there are a few States in which tribal-state compacts have not been reached.  
   And the conflict we are challenged with resolving is how to accommodate the desire of these States to be involved in the regulation of Indian gaming and their equally strong desire to avoid any process which might enable the parties to overcome an impasse in their negotiations. 
   The Secretary of the Interior is to be commended in his efforts to achieve what the Congress has been unable to accomplish in the past few years. 
   Following the Supreme Court's 11th amendment ruling, the Secretary took a reasonable course of action. 
   He published a notice of proposed rulemaking, inviting comments on his authority to promulgate regulations for an alternative process to the tribal-State compacting process established in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
   Thereafter, he followed the next appropriate steps under the Administrative Procedures Act, inviting the input of all interested parties in the promulgation of regulations. 
   When the Senate acted to prohibit him from proceeding in this time-honored fashion, he brought together representatives of the National Governors Association, the National Association of Attorneys General, and the tribal governments, to explore whether a consensus could be reached on these and other matters. 
   In the meantime, my colleagues propose an amendment that would prohibit the Secretary from proceeding with the regulatory process. 
   Once again, there have been no hearings on this proposal--no public consideration of this formulation--no input from the governments involved and directly affected by this proposal. 
   Last year, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior made clear his intention to recommend a veto of the Interior appropriations bill should this provision be adopted by the Senate and approved in House-Senate conference. 
   I suggest that it is unlikely that the Secretary's position has changed in any material respect--particularly in light of all that he has undertaken to accomplish, including frank discussion amongst the State and tribal governments. 
   As one who initiated a similar discussion process several years ago, I am more than a little familiar with the issues that require resolution. 
   However, in the intervening years, court rulings have clarified and put to rest many of the issues that were in contention in that earlier process. 
   I have continued to talk to Governors and attorneys general and tribal government leaders on a weekly, if not daily basis, and I believe, as the Secretary does, that the potential is there for the State and tribal governments to come to some mutually acceptable resolution of the matters that remain outstanding between them. 
   I believe the Secretary's process should be allowed to proceed. 
   I also believe that pre-empting that process through an amendment to this bill could well serve as the death knell for what is ultimately the only viable way to accomplish a final resolution. 
   The alternative is to proceed in this piecemeal fashion each year--an amendment each year to prohibit the Secretary from taking any action that would bridge the gap in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that was created by the Court's ruling and which will inevitably discourage the State and tribal governments from fashioning solutions. 
   This is not the way to do the business of the people. 
   There are those in this body who are opposed to gaming. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I count myself in their numbers. I am opposed to gaming. 
   Hawaii and Utah are the only two States in our Union that criminally prohibit all forms of gaming, and I support that prohibition in my State. 
   But I have walked many miles in Indian country, and I have seen the poverty, and the desperation and despair in the eyes of many Indian parents and their children. 
   I have looked into the eyes of the elders--eyes that express great sadness. 
   I have met young Indian people who are now dead because they saw no hope for the future. 
   And I have seen what gaming has enabled tribal governments to do, for the first time--to build hospitals and clinics, to repair and construct safe schools, to provide jobs or the adults and educational opportunities for the youth--and perhaps most importantly, to engender a real optimism that there can be and will be--the prospects for a brighter future. 
   It is for these reasons, and because of their rights as sovereigns to pursue activities that hold the potential for making their tribal economies become both viable and stable over the long term, that I support Indian gaming. 
   And it is for these reasons, that I must, again this year, strongly oppose the efforts of my colleagues to take from Indian country, what unfortunately has become the single ray of hope for the future that native people have had for a very long time.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor Lieutenant General Ronald B. Blanck as he retires from the United States Army after more than thirty-two years of active duty service. For the last four years, General Blanck has served as  the United States Army Surgeon General and Commander, U.S. Army Medical Command General. During his tenure, he had significant oversight of eight Department of Defense activities as well as the management of the Army's $6.6 billion, worldwide integrated health system. 
   Beginning his career as a general medical officer in Vietnam, General Blanck went on to hold a variety of executive positions that include: professor and teaching chief in graduate medical education at the Uniformed Services University; medical consultant to the Army Surgeon General; Commander of Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the North Atlantic Regional Medical Command; and finally as the U.S. Army's 39th Surgeon General. General Blanck has met every challenge with enthusiasm and zeal. His team-building, compassion, and vision have resulted in greater cooperation among the Federal Health Services and improved delivery of medical care to our nation's military, past and present. 
   General Blanck guided the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) through a period of re-engineering and instituted collaborative missions with the Department of State, Department of Treasury, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Agency, National Aeronautic and Space Administration, National Transportation and Safety Board, and the Veterans Administration. These partnerships have fostered unparalleled advances in science and facilitated the reputation of AFIP as being known as the ``People's Institute.'' 
   He re-energized the Army Medical Department and instituted best business practices to ensure the provision of comprehensive, quality healthcare to service members, retired and active, and their family members. Faced with a military medical end-strength reduction of 34%, a reduction in Army medical treatment facilities of 45%, and medical force structure requirements reduction of 77%, General Blanck met the challenge. His brilliant leadership, compassionate vision and unprecedented achievements will guide the Army Medical Department and the entire federal health care system into the new millenium. 
   General Blanck's contributions to Persian Gulf Illness and Anthrax programs, his interactions with Congress and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), and his commitment to the delivery of world-class medical care in support of contingency operations, national emergencies, and potential weapons of mass destruction scenarios are unsurpassed. Mr. President, while General Blanck's many meritorious awards and decorations demonstrate his contributions in a tangible way, it is the legacy he leaves behind for the Army Medical Corps, the United States Army, and the Department of Defense for which we are most appreciative. It is with pride that I congratulate General Blanck on his outstanding career of exemplary service.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, section 8118 of H.R. 4576, a bill making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes, refers to the National Center for the Preservation of Democracy. What is the National Center for the Preservation of Democracy? What is the rationale and purpose of the National Center for the Preservation of Democracy? 
   I will do my best to respond to the above questions. 
   The history of America demonstrates the vision and intent of its Founding Fathers when framing the Constitution. As a living document the Constitution has proven over time its capacity to meet the changing needs of the United States, ensuring the protection of all of its people. The story of Americans of Japanese ancestry represents a complete lesson of democracy in action and exemplifies the American dream. From immigration in the late 1800s, to issues of citizenship in the early 1900s, to the incarceration of citizens and the heroics of Japanese-American soldiers during World War II, and to redress in the 1980s, the Japanese-American story is about the struggles and victories of individual freedoms in the United States. Through their experiences, Japanese-Americans have validated all that is possible and all that is right with our constitutional guarantees. The Japanese-American story celebrates the triumphs of American democracy. 
   The National Center for the Preservation of Democracy will be headquartered in the renovated and transformed Historic Building of the Japanese-American National Museum in Los Angeles, CA. The Historic Building is a National Historic Landmark as designated by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. This space will keep alive and teach about a remarkable time in U.S. history, a period of shame and sacrifice and insult that ended with a burst of glory demonstrating the majesty of our government to recognize its errors and make a public apology and some restitution. 
   The Japanese-American story illustrates the splendor of the United States and the magnificence of the Constitution. Since their initial immigration in the late nineteenth century, Japanese-Americans have believed  strongly in the American dream and have sought to make America their home. Although confronted by prejudice and discrimination, Japanese-Americans have utilized that very democratic process in the spirit intended by the Framers of the Constitution. The story of Japanese-Americans is about democracy in action. 
   Like other immigrants, Japanese journeyed to the United States seeking opportunity and dreams of a better life. From the moment they arrived in the late nineteenth century, however, they were confronted with social prejudice and discriminatory laws already in place. The Naturalization Act passed by Congress on March 26, 1790, which restricted naturalization to ``free white men,'' was unavailable to persons of Japanese ancestry. Designated as ``aliens ineligible for citizenship'' (the only racialized group so defined until 1952), Japanese immigrants were rendered as perpetual aliens, a condition that prevented their full enjoyment of life, liberty and property. Nonetheless, the Issei--Japanese immigrants--courageously maintained their belief in America and moved forward to establish their new lives in the United States. More than that, through hard work and perseverance, Japanese enterprise prospered in the face of indifference. 
   Without citizenship, Japanese immigrants were subject to alien land laws, which prohibited ownership of land by ``aliens ineligible for citizenship.'' Although denied full participation as Americans, Japanese immigrants consistently sought, through non-violent legal efforts, to undo the intent of discriminatory laws through public campaigns, litigation, and other peaceful strategies. Their hopes in becoming citizens were further hindered, however, when on November 13, 1922 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the Ozawa case, definitively prohibiting Japanese immigrants from become naturalized citizens on the basis of race. Moreover, the future of the Japanese in the United States was further restricted when President Calvin Coolidge signed the Immigration Law of 1924, which was based on race and omitted Japanese from the quota system. 
   When Japan bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, America was stunned and angered. For Japanese Americans, who had been subject to discrimination because of their ancestry, the whole world turned dark. However, as the United States confronted the threat of fascism in Asia and Europe, American democracy itself was put to a challenge and, for Japanese Americans, it fell short. Because they ``looked like the enemy'' and were thought to be a military threat, 120,000 individuals of Japanese ancestry, two-thirds of whom were American born citizens, were excluded from the West Coast, forcibly removed, and incarcerated in concentration camps. These prison camps were at first operated by the Army, and then the War Relocation Authority. This event has become the largest violation of constitutional rights in American history. 
   For Japanese-American males, the beginning of the war was especially humbling and painful as the Selective Service designated them as, IV-C, enemy aliens. Although they were loyal to the United States, these American born citizens were rendered ineligible to enlist in the armed services. Nonetheless, when the government announced the formation of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a segregated unit of Japanese-Americans, thousands of young Japanese-American men enthusiastically volunteered to serve. Stigmatized by the classification as enemy aliens, they were eager to prove their loyalty to the United States. Government officials were surprised by the overwhelming response. While family and friends were incarcerated behind barbed wire, the soldiers of the 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, as well as the Military Intelligence Service fought and died for the United States and for the preservation of democracy with no guarantee that their civil rights would be restored. There service demonstrates the ultimate in patriotism and love of country. 
   In 223 days of combat, the 100th Infantry Battalion and 442nd Regimental Combat Team became one of the most decorated units in United States military history. Among the many awards and decorations received by the men of the 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team are 20 Congressional Medals of Honor, 354 Silver Star Medals, 33 Distinguished Service Crosses and over 3600 Purple Heart Medals. Their distinguished record includes the rescue of the ``Lost Battalion'' and participation in the assault that cracked the Gothic Line of Nazi strongholds. Affirming the unending truth that loyalty to one's nation is not modified by racial origin, these soldiers fought two wars, one for democracy overseas and the other for racial discrimination back home in the United States. As President Harry Truman said, ``You fought not only the enemy but you fought prejudice--and you have won.'' Indeed, these brave and courageous young men believed that their sacrifices would make life better not only for Japanese-Americans but for all Americans. The privileges of democracy that Americans enjoy today are the result of the blood shed by these American heroes. The sacrifices of officers and men of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the 100th Infantry Battalion, the Military Intelligence Service, and others have helped to make America a more democratic nation, and their valiant service continues to be a source of pride for all Americans. 
   In response to their heroic achievements, President Harry Truman challenged ``Keep up the fight and we will continue to win and to assure that this republic stands for what the Constitution says it stands for: the welfare of all of the people, all of the time.'' Many members of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team took President Truman's words to heart. Several soldiers went on to fight for democracy through their service as elected officials while others continued to serve in the armed forces. Eventually Japanese-Americans went on to fight in the Korean War and later the Vietnam War. Unlike Japanese-American soldiers during World War II who, after being designated as ``enemy aliens,'' served to prove their loyalty, Japanese-American soldiers in the Korean war and the Vietnam war served in the Armed Forces as Americans, full-fledged citizens of the United States. Without the need to prove their status as Americans, the reason for these courageous men to serve was purely for the love of country. 
   Inevitably, the impact of the heroic service of Japanese-American soldiers during World War II went on to enhance the civil liberties of all Americans. In 1948, segregation in the armed services ended in large part from the efforts of the 442nd and in 1952 the Walter-McCarran Act made all races eligible for naturalization and eliminated race as a bar to immigration. Thus, Japanese immigrants, many of whom were parents of World War II veterans, were able to finally attain their citizenship as Americans. 
   One of the more magnificent examples of American democracy at its most powerful form is the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, in which the United States recognized its grave and fundamental injustice of violating the civil liberties of its own citizens. Advanced by many Japanese-American war veterans, the law makes a formal apology and provides token restitution to former internees. No other country in the world can make the claim of acknowledging and apologizing for its mistakes--a point that further illustrates the grand majesty of the United States. More importantly, to demonstrate its commitment of assuring that similar events do not happen, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 provided funds to educate all Americans about the lessons from the incarceration. 
   While $50 million was authorized in the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 for educational purposes, the appropriations were significantly reduced because of the lack of funds available to pay the eligible individual claimants. The Civil Liberties Public Education Fund received only $5 million to fulfill its congressional mandate to educate the public about the lessons learned from the incarceration. With limited funding, the education of the exclusion, forced removal, and incarceration of Japanese-Americans during World War II was dramatically compromised and the government's commitment to educating the public has yet to be effectively fulfilled. The National Center  for the Preservation of Democracy established in the Historic Building of the Japanese-American National Museum will achieve that objective. 
   Through their efforts since the late 19th century, Japanese-Americans have secured the civil rights of all Americans, contributing to the most basic tenets of America's foundational ideals and promises--of life, liberty, and property. Although clearly denied many of those freedoms at various times throughout history, Japanese-Americans consistently sought, through non-violent legal efforts, to secure Constitutional guarantees and the promise of the American dream. With that, they deepened and enriched the meaning of the American identity--the notion of who is an American--and the rights, privileges, and obligations that comprise the Republic's very core. 
   The National Center for the Preservation of Democracy will be assisted by the Japanese-American National Museum in the examination of the rights and freedoms of Americans in the United States through the Japanese-American experience. Because its mission is dedicated to the study, preservation, and interpretation of democratic issues, the National Museum maintains extensive expertise that will enable the National Center for the Preservation of Democracy to: 
   Develop and exhibit nationwide programs about the issues of democracy; 
   Have ready access to significant collections relating to these issues, especially the legacy of Japanese-American military service, including artifacts of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and other military units; 
   Benefit from the relationships established and maintained by the National Museum, especially with federal institutions and related community organizations; and 
   Provide a dynamic visitor experience in a historic building. 
   The National Center for the Preservation of Democracy will be created as a dedicated space where visitors can learn about the enduring fragility and ultimate success of individual and constitutional rights. The headquarters will be established in a renovated and transformed historic building provided by the Japanese American National Museum. 
   Some of the historical highlights of the building, which was constructed in 1925, include: 
   Served as the first Buddhist temple in Southern California and as a center for social and religious life for the immigrant community; 
   Site where priests, who lived in the building, were arrested without due cause immediately following the bombing of Pearl Harbor; 
   Used as one of the sites where the Army instructed ``aliens and non-aliens of Japanese ancestry to assemble for transportation to Santa Anita Racetrack, which had been transformed into an Assembly Center; 
   Served as a storage site for personal articles that could not be taken by those forced to leave; and 
   Served as a hostel for many returning from camp and had no where to go. 
   The National Center for the Preservation of Democracy will provide educational programming that includes exhibitions, media arts presentations, public programs, conferences, and civic dialogue/public forums. The National Center for the Preservation of Democracy will: 
   Present a permanent, audience-focused exhibition addressing American democracy through the Japanese-American experience, including the military service of Japanese-Americans (in World War I, World War II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war); 
   Maintain and pursue key civil and military materials for a comprehensive collection; 
   Create and esttablish new opportunities for civil and military research, especially through collaboration with federal institutions such as the National Archives and the Smithsonian Institution to make documents more accessible; 
   Conduct education and public programs examining democracy in action; and 
   Produce educational media arts productions that present and interpret related issues of democracy for broad national and international broadcast and distribution as well as for on-site exhibitions. 
   I respectfully believe that the National Center for the Preservation of Democracy is most worthy of our support. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am not a pilot. However, I believe that in this body I spend more time on aircraft than other Members. 
   My home is in Hawaii. Whenever I leave the city of Washington to return home, I must prepare myself for 11 hours and 15 minutes of flight time. In that sense, I believe I am an experienced person when it comes to flying. However, in my case, because of the uncertainty of the schedule in the Senate, we cannot make reservations 3 or 4 months ahead of time. I have had a reservation for this Friday, but I just canceled that because I think we are going to be handling appropriations measures. As a result, if something should come about making it possible for me to fly back to Hawaii this Friday, I may be able to get a flight, leaving at some strange hour, economy class, which I don't mind. But at the end of the trip, I usually can get home to my apartment and spend an evening of rest. 
   The men who fly these planes have special responsibilities. When they get on a flight to go to Russia, they are not going to be escorted to a fancy hotel as soon as they land. They are expected to go to a meeting at that point. The least we can provide our commanders is some rest and some comfort before they get into some big business. 
   Secondly, these are not just any old aircraft. They have to be specially equipped. In wartime and in peacetime, these planes are their headquarters. They make command decisions on these flights. They are expected to be in contact with the men and women under their command at all times. We are fortunate. In a sense, we are 8-to-8 employees. We get to work about 8 o'clock and we leave work about 8. A military commander is like a police officer. He is on duty 24 hours a day. These aircraft must be equipped to be able to provide support for his 24-hour-a-day responsibility. 
   Yes, we do have 71 Learjets in the inventory at this time. That is a large fleet, 71 Learjets. But they are getting pretty old and inadequate for the assignments. Within 5 years, about 45 are going to be retired. Within 10 years, we will find that all of these will be gone. 
   We have 707s. I don't know how many of my colleagues have been flying on 707s recently, but they are considered pretty old, 35 years old. Whether we like it or not, we will have to retire these aircraft. Yes, we have C-22s, the 727. They are 25 years old. They can't last forever. They are going to be retired pretty soon. 
   A third consideration: This provision in our bill does not specify the name of the aircraft. We do this deliberately because we don't want to favor one company over another. If we put in the G-5 that we are favoring one company, the Grumman, or if we put in something else, we are going to be favoring another company. That is not our wish. We want this to undergo a competitive system. I think we have fulfilled that requirement by this amendment. 
   Overall, there is another consideration. We have been speaking of admirals and generals. Much of the time you will find that these aircraft are being used by our civilian leaders, Cabinet people. Just 2 days ago, the Secretary of State went to Syria, to Damascus, to attend the funeral of President Assad. She did not go on Pan American or TWA. She went on a military aircraft. I would hope that we Americans would want our 
   Secretary of State to travel in an aircraft worthy of her position. We can easily say United Airlines is good enough for me, why is it not good enough for general so-and-so? Well, if he is going home for vacation, he should take United Airlines or Delta, whatever airlines he wants to take. But these aircraft are not being used for personal purposes. They are being used for military purposes. I hope we will understand this. I hope when the vote is called, we will vote against this. 
   I would support my colleagues from Iowa and California if I at any time thought these aircraft were perks. They are not perks. Any person who is willing to command troops and stand in harm's way in my behalf and in behalf of the people of the United States,  I say a G-5 is good for them. If we get something better than that, so be it. Nothing is too good for them. 
   I hope my colleagues will support the leadership and managers of this measure and vote against this amendment.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, shortly before Memorial Day, an excellent analytical piece was printed in the Washington Post under the headline For Pentagon, Asia Moving. I am afraid that not many of my colleagues had an opportunity to read that piece, because they were preparing to go home to visit their constituents over the Memorial Day recess. I would like to draw their attention to this thoughtful analysis of events and circumstances that will shape American Defense policies for the next several decades. 
   In essence, the article suggests that, of necessity, the focus of American defense planning, our strategy and tactics--our deployments--will shift from Europe to Asia. Current events in Korea, the rise of China as a modern military power, the spread of nuclear weapons to South-Asia, all of these dictate a re-examination of our defense policies. We must attend to how we train and where we may someday fight. 
   To me, the article suggests the importance of Hawaii to our Nation's defense posture in the twenty-first century. The Washington Post article notes that, to many Americans, Hawaii appears to be well out in the Pacific, but it is another 5,000 miles from there to Shanghai. ``All told, it is about twice as far from San Diego to China, as it is from New York to Europe.'' 
   We need to think about what this means. As U.S. economic interests in Asia come to dominate our economy, so too will U.S. security interests in Asia come to dominate our military policies. We must think about the distances involved and the need to be able to strike distant targets swiftly and with precision. The Air Force will need more long-range bombers and refueling aircraft. I have long advocated the acquisition of more B-2 bombers. The war in Kosovo showed that they could strike at long range and with precision. The Post article suggests to me that we may at some time need them in Asia and that we had better be prepared by making those investments soon. 
   Similarly, the Navy will have to put more of its resources into the Pacific. Already the Navy has placed a larger percentage of its attack submarines in the Pacific. Surely, this will be followed by decisions to forward position carriers and other elements of carrier task forces. I believe Pearl Harbor will become even more important to the Navy. I know the people of Hawaii are prepared to welcome additional ships. 
   The Army, too, is faced with the need to be able to respond quickly to deter future threats in Asia. We need to look to more joint training exercises and even the possibility of keeping some of our forces in Korea after peace takes hold on the Peninsula. 
   Mr. President, I commend this May 26, 2000 Washington Post article to my colleagues. I ask unanimous consent that it be reprinted in full in the RECORD.

   Mr. INOUYE. My Chairman is correct in his understanding. The Congress has long been concerned with the ravaging extent of poverty, homelessness, and the high rates of unemployment in Native America. The Congress has consistently recognized that the economic devastation that has been wrought on Native communities can be directly attributed to Federal policies of the forced removal of Native people from their traditional homelands, their forced relocation, and later the termination of the reservations to which the government forcibly relocated them. In 1970, President Nixon established the Federal policy of self-determination, and that policy has been supported and strengthened by each succeeding administration. 
   The Congress has sought to do its part in fostering strong Native economies through the enactment of a wide range of Federal laws, including a series of incentives that are designed to stimulate economic growth in Native communities and provide economic opportunities for Native American-owned businesses. Native American-owned businesses include not only those that are owned by an Indian tribe or an Alaska Native corporation or a Native Hawaiian organization, but those businesses that are 51 percent or more owned by Native Americans. 
   As the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear, time and again, the political and legal relationship that this nation has had with the indigenous, aboriginal, native people of America is the basis upon which the Congress can constitutionally enact legislation that is designed to address the special conditions of Native Americans. In exchange for the cession of over 500 million acres of land by the native people of America, the United States has entered into a trust relationship with Native Americans. Treaties, the highest law of our land, were originally the primary instrument for the expression of this relationship. Today, Federal laws like section 8014, are the means by which the United States carries out its trust responsibilities and the Federal policy of self-determination and economic self-sufficiency. 
   I thank my Chairman for proposing this clarifying amendment which I believe is fully consistent with the original purpose and intent of section 8014.

   Mr. INOUYE. May I first thank my chairman for his most generous remarks. 
   Mr. President, I begin by congratulating Chairman STEVENS for the superb manner in which he has guided this bill through the committees to the floor. 
   I wish to associate myself with the remarks of my dear friend and chairman of the committee, Senator STEVENS. I suggest to my colleagues that this is a good measure, worthy of support by all of us. I join my chairman in requesting that our colleagues submit their amendments in a timely fashion. 
   I note that this measure--a measure that includes $287.6 billion; the largest ever considered by this Senate--was unanimously approved by the Committee on Appropriations by a vote of 28-0. 
   It will do a great deal for both our readiness and moderniation requirements to protect our nation's security. 
   Highlights include: 
   For our military personnel and their families: It provides full funding for military pay including a 3.7 percent pay raise; an increase of $153 million for military bonuses to improve recruiting and retention; and increases for the GI bill for Reservists. 
   The subcommittee has fully funded readiness programs, including: $4.1 billion to support our peacekeepers overseas; an increase of $183 million for our National guard; and a total increase of $4.5 billion for readiness from the levels provided in FY 2000. 
   Full funding is also recommended for the new prescription drug benefit as authorized; and $275 million is recommended for breast and prostate cancer research. 
   Critical investment highlights include the following: Full funding for our F-22 and F/A-18 fighters; an increase of $250 million for the Army's highest priority, ``transformation''; full funding for the Navy's carrier, submarines, and destroyers; and, an increase of $411 million for ballistic missile defense programs. 
   However, Senators should be advised that the bill does not provide a blank check to the Pentagon. 
   It includes some tough reductions to programs that are being schedule, over budget, or simply not ready to proceed at this time. 
   I want to assure my colleagues that the No. 1 priority in this bill is to protect near-term readiness. 
   The men and women willing to go into harm's way to protect the rest of us simply must be provided the tools they need to defeat any threat. 
   At the same time, the bill provides sufficient funding for modernization programs so that future readiness will also be protected. We must continue to invest for the future to ensure we are never caught unprepared. 
   I would also like to point out that the Chairman has been very responsive to the wishes of the members. Many of the suggestions made by the Members of the Senate have been incorporated into bill. 
   This is a very good bill. I strongly encourage all my colleagues to support it.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend the Native American Languages Act to provide authority for the establishment of Native American Language Survival Schools. I am joined in co-sponsorship by Senators AKAKA, COCHRAN, DODD, KENNEDY, MURRAY and SCHUMER. 
   Mr. President, for hundreds of years, beginning with the arrival of European settlers on America's shores, the native peoples of America have had to fight for the survival of their cultures. History has shown that the ability to maintain and preserve the culture and traditions of a people is directly tied to the perpetuation of native languages. Like others, the traditional languages of Native American people are an integral part of their culture and identity. They provide the means for passing down to each new generation the stories, customs, religion, history and traditional ways of life. To lose the diversity and vibrant history of many Indian nations, is to lose a vital part of the history of this country. 
   Mr. President, Native American languages are near extinction in the United States. Studies suggest that at one time several thousand distinct Indian languages existed in what is now America. Today that number has dwindled to approximately 155 Indian languages. Of these 155 languages remaining, 45 are only spoken by elders, 60 are spoken only by middle-aged adults or older adults, 30 are spoken by all adults but not children, and only 20 Native languages are spoken by most of the children. With so many Native communities facing the loss of their languages as elderly native speakers pass on before the language can be taught to younger generations, it is little wonder that this tragedy is growing exponentially, day by day. 
   In the 1880s, as part of the United States' forced assimilation policies towards Native Americans, a system of off-reservation boarding schools was initiated. Native American children were forcibly taken from their families, transported hundreds of miles to schools where their hair was cut notwithstanding the religious importance of hair length in most native cultures, their clothes replaced with military-style uniforms, and they were forbidden to speak their native languages or practice their religion. Although this effort to eradicate Indian culture was not successful, it did separate several generations of Native Americans from their native languages. 
   The Native American Languages Act of 1990 officially repudiated the policies of the past and declared that ``it is the policy of the United States to preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice, and develop Native American languages.'' The Act was amended in 1992 to provide financial support to Native American language projects. 
   Mr. President, this bill would bring the nation one step closer to assuring the preservation and revitalization of Native American languages by supporting the development of Native American Language Survival Schools. These schools would provide a complete education through the use of both Native American languages and English. The bill also provides support for Native American Language Nests, which are Native American language immersion programs for children aged six and under. In addition, the bill provides authority for the following activities: curriculum development, teacher, staff and community resource development, rental, lease, purchase, construction, maintenance or repair of educational facilities, and the establishment of two Native American Language School support centers at the Native Language College of the University of Hawaii at Hilo, and the Alaska Native Language Center of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to assist the Native people of America in their efforts to reverse the effects of past Federal policies by reintroducing today's children to their Native languages and preserving Native languages for the generations to come.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. In 1992, President Bush signed into law legislation designating May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month to celebrate the contributions the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities have made to our country. 
   Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have been instrumental in the development of the American landscape for more than a century. The diversity within the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities exemplifies the richness of our multicultural country, celebrated through Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. 
   Valuing family, cultural heritage, and commitment to society, Asian Americans and Pacific islanders have built strong communities contributing to our dynamic society and adding strength to the foundation of our country. With strong values, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have succeeded in many facets of life including science where Dr. David Ho was celebrated as Time Magazine's 1996 Man of the Year; the arts, with fashion designer Vera Wang, writer Amy Tan, and actress Ming Na-Wen; sports with ice skaters such as Kristi Yamaguchi and Michelle Kwan and football legend Junior Seau; in the military where General Eric Shinseki is the Chief of Staff for the U.S. Army; and politics where there are two Pacific Islander Governors and where I am joined by six other Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders serving in Congress, and where a record number of Asian American and Pacific Islanders are serving as Administration appointees in some of the highest offices of government. This list is by no means exhaustive, it only scratches the surface of the contributions Asian American and Pacific Islanders have made to our country. Asian Pacific American Heritage Month allows us to pay tribute to the commitment and contributions these men and women have made to their communities and to our country. 
   The growth of the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, along with the achievements we have gained, have brought Asian American and Pacific Islander issues to the forefront of American politics. Last June, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13125 establishing the White House Asian and Pacific Islander Initiative seeking to improve the quality of life for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders through increased participation in federal government programs where they are most likely to be under-served. I commend the President for this Initiative and optimistically look forward to the progress this commission will achieve, under the chairmanship of Mr. Norman Mineta, to highlight and challenge issues pertinent to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. 
   Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have made considerable contributions to our nation. I am pleased that through Asian Pacific American Heritage Month the various histories, cultures, triumphs, and hardships of all Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders can be celebrated, honored, and remembered.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor Rear Admiral (Upper Half) Stephen Todd Fisher as he retires from the United States Navy after more than thirty-four years of active duty service. For the last five years, Rear Admiral Fisher has been the Deputy Surgeon General of the Navy-the first non-physician officer to serve in that position. 
   In addition, Rear Admiral Fisher was the first Medical Service Corps officer to be selected by a board to the rank of two-star Admiral within the Department of Defense. He served as the Director of the Medical Service Corps from 1993--1995. RADM Fisher's assignments included tours on the U.S.S Repose (AH 16); Headquarters, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific; various Navy Hospitals and Clinics; the Naval School of Health Sciences; the office of the Chief of Naval Operations; and the Headquarters for Navy Medicine. He is also the recipient of the 2000 American Hospital Association award for Excellence in Federal Service. 
   Rear Admiral Fisher's leadership as the Executive Agent for the Department of Defense Clinical Business Area led to the development of a computerized patient record which will be tested and evaluated this summer for government-wide adoption. This accomplishment has been highly praised by the National Library of Medicine Board of Regents and completes the planning segment of the Composite Health Care System II program. As Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Government Computerized Patient Record, Rear Admiral Fisher coordinated linkage between the Department of Veteran's Health Administration, the Department of Defense, and the Indian Health Services. A prototype of the Computerized Patient Record has been developed and will be alpha tested in Alaska in 2001. Under his leadership, the Composite Health Care System II Program Office was selected for the Government Technology Leadership Award and the Smithsonian Technology Award in recognition of its visionary use of information technology. 
   As a principal member of the Military Health System Information Management Proponent Committee, Rear Admiral Fisher worked closely with the Deputy Surgeons General of the Air Force and Army, and the Executive Director of the Defense Medical Information Management System orchestrating the development, prioritization, and achievement of information management goals for medical readiness and peacetime health care programs for the Department of Defense. His contributions are far-reaching and will positively impact military health care for years to come. 
   Mr. President, Rear Admiral Fisher's many meritorious awards and decorations demonstrate his contributions in a tangible way, but it is the legacy he leaves behind for the Navy Medical Service Corps, the United States Navy, and the Department of Defense for which we are most appreciative. It is with pride that I congratulate Rear Admiral Fisher on his outstanding career of exemplary service.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my Chairman, Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, in the introduction of a bill to reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976, Public Law 94-437. 
   Mr. President, for the past two years, the leaders of Indian country have been engaged in a consultation process with the Indian Health Service in an effort to address changes to the Act which would hold the potential of improving and enhancing the ability of tribal health programs, urban Indian health care programs, and the Indian Health Service to provide comprehensive primary health care and public health services to all eligible American Indian and Alaska Native patients citizens. 
   The goal of the consultation process was to build a consensus on the best means of addressing the health care challenges that confront Native America, so that the reauthorization bill could reflect a unified vision of the Indian Health Service, tribal governments and urban Indian health care programs. The tribal participants in this process appropriately named this comprehensive consultation process ``Speaking with One Voice''. 
   Mr. President, this tribally-developed reauthorization bill is the most comprehensive to date. The first step in the consultation process was the convening of a roundtable discussion with tribal leaders, urban Indian health care providers, Indian Health Service health care professionals, national Indian health organizations, researchers, and other policy makers. Specific recommendations regarding the manner in which tribal consultation meetings would be carried out were developed at this Roundtable. From these recommendations, the Roundtable participants developed a consultation approach that included the pursuit of consensus on what amendments to the Act were necessary and the identification of opportunities for change, the identification of area and regional differences, the promotion of a partnership environment for tribes, urban Indians, and the Indian Health Service, and the establishment of a core group to review materials. 
   Beginning in the fall of 1998, tribal representatives participated in twelve Area meetings to begin discussing concerns and recommendations related to the Act. Each of the twelve geographic Areas facilitated a consultation process with health care providers in their respective Areas, and this process was completed in January 1999. 
   Four regional consultation meetings were held across the country from January to April, 1999. Regional meetings were intended to provide a forum for tribes to provide input, to share the recommendations from each Area, and to build consensus among participants for a unified position from each regional meeting. From these four meetings, a matrix of 135 recommendations for each of the sections in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act was developed, as well as proposals for new provisions. Over 900 health care providers participated in the four regional meetings. 
   Upon the completion of the four regional meetings, the Indian Health Service convened a National Steering committee composed of elected tribal representatives and urban Indian health care program directors. Many of the members of the steering committee had participated in the Area and regional consultation meetings. The National Steering Committee developed a draft consensus bill based on the Area and regional consultation meetings. The draft bill was mailed to every tribal government and urban Indian health care program in the nation with a 30-day period for additional comments. The draft bill was then presented at a national meeting in Washington, D.C. in late July of last year. Participants in this national meeting included tribal government leaders, urban Indian health care providers, members of Congress and their staff, as well as several Administration and departmental officials. 
   The National Steering Committee has completed a monumental task with the broad support of Indian Tribes and communities across the United States. 
   With this in mind, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am deeply honored to rise in tribute to over 3,000 courageous professional Navy Nurses of the Korean War, undaunted in the face of danger, who unselfishly answered the call of duty. They came from every corner of the nation. They came from all walks of life. They joined the Navy because they wanted to serve their country. They wanted to share their professional nursing skills and to care for those injured in body, mind and spirit. 
   The Navy nurses of the Korean War claim they did nothing special, they were just doing their job. But in the hearts of all who served with them, the doctors and the corpsmen, and their patients, Navy Nurses of the Korean War are true American heroes. 
   During the Korean War, whole blood could only be kept for eight days. Hospital ships were in Korean waters for weeks, months. Navy nurses gave their own blood for patient transfusions. Many aboard the hospital ship Haven were found to be anemic from giving so much of their blood for the injured. 
   Nurses worked around the clock during the mass casualties brought in from battles like Chosin Reservoir. Many times they worked 96 hours with just two hours of sleep in between swells of patients. Ever resilient and effervescent, Navy Nurses of the Korea War volunteered to assist orphanages in Inchon and Pusan caring for sick and wounded children. Severely injured children were brought back to hospital ships for surgery like having shrapnel removed from head wounds. 
   Nurses ventured into POW camps to ensure that children in these camps were treated and inoculated. Whether the nurses were stationed close to the fighting aboard hospital ships in Korean waters, at Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Japan, at other medical facilities in the Far East or on the home front, nurses were always there for their patients.......their patients always came first. 
   Fifty years ago, Navy Nurses who served during the Korean War came home to quietly live their lives. For fifty years our nation has not known about this group of patriotic nurses who volunteered to serve our country. And they did it because they wanted to. They did it because they cared about our nation. They did it because they wanted to share their nursing skills. They did it because of their respect for life. 
   Let us not wait a day longer. Let us remember how these courageous, patriotic women answered the call of their country. And let us remember those Navy nurses who made it home in spirit only to live on in the hearts of family, friends and their fellow countrymen. Let us remember those Navy Nurses of the Korean War who are now in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. These nurses who once fought so valiantly to save the lives of their patients, now fight each day for their own survival. 
   Navy Nurses of the Korean War, you are forgotten no more. You shall remain in the hearts and spirits of all Americans. Let your story be told. Let your story be heard. Let your story be preserved in our history and remembered for decades to come. Your sacrifices and uncommon valor sparks the fire of patriotism, the foundation of our nation. 
   Navy Nurses of the Korean War, your unfaltering commitment of service to our country brings pride and honor to us. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in remembering these quiet heroes--the Navy Nurses of the Korean War. 
   Navy Nurses of the Korean War.......thank you from the bottom of our hearts. You are our heroes. You are forever remembered in the hearts and souls of your fellow countrymen. You are forever remembered in the history of our Nation.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor Captain John (Jack) and Captain Gloria Caffrey as they retire after more than sixty years of combined dedicated service in the United States Navy. These two outstanding Navy Nurse Corps officers culminate their distinguished careers at the Naval Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida, where Captain Jack Caffrey served as the Director of Operational Medicine and Captain Gloria Caffrey as the Director of Nursing Services and Associate Director of Clinical Services. 
   Captain Jack Caffrey has distinguished himself as a true leader and pace setter in the Navy Nurse Corps. In addition to his last assignment in Operational Medicine, highlights of his  career include serving as the Commanding Officer and Executive Officer of the Naval School of Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland. His strong leadership and dedication to excellence in education and training programs led to unprecedented technological advances in training materials and methodologies. For more than thirty years Captain Jack Caffrey has met every challenge and every assignment with enthusiasm and zeal. He has served as a positive role model for all Nurse Corps officers and his contributions will positively impact military nursing and health care for years to come. 
   Captain Gloria Caffrey has also distinguished herself as an outstanding Nurse Corp officer for more than thirty years and has excelled in numerous executive and clinical assignments. While her accomplishments have been many, highlights of her career include serving as the Head of the Nurse Corps Assignment Section in the Bureau of Naval Personnel. In this role, she expertly managed the assignment of 3,200 Nurse Corps officers to billets Navy-wide. Captain Gloria Caffrey was instrumental in increasing the number of Nurse Corps officers selected to Executive Medicine billets and was key in developing policy changes affecting Defense Officer Personnel Management Act grade relief and subspecialty reductions. Her superior leadership, vision, and dedication to duty has been an inspiration to all military nurses. Captain Gloria Caffrey leaves a lasting legacy of excellence. 
   Mr. President, more than fifty years ago, as I was recovering in a military hospital, I began a unique relationship with military nurses. The Caffreys embody what I know military nurses to be--strong, dedicated professional leaders, stepping to the forefront to serve their country and committed to caring for our Sailors, Marines, Airmen, Soldiers and family members during peacetime and at war. Captains Jack and Gloria Caffrey's many meritorious awards and decorations demonstrate their contributions in a tangible way, but it is the legacy they leave behind for the Navy Nurse Corps, the United States Navy and the Department of Defense of which we are most appreciative. It is with pride that I congratulate both Captain Jack Caffrey and Captain Gloria Caffrey on their outstanding careers of exemplary service.

    Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise today to call attention to a recent New York Times article, ``India's Unwired Villages Mired in the Distant Past.'' It is because of the struggles developing nations face, as illustrated in the article, that I support the United States Telecommunications Training Institute (USTTI) and their work to increase access to telecommunications. 
   The USTTI is a nonprofit joint venture connecting the public and private sectors, providing tuition-free communications and broadcast training to professionals from around the world. USTTI is geared toward meeting the common training needs of the women and men who are bringing modern communications to the developing world. 
   The development of the telecommunications industry may be seen as a solution to economic troubles in developing nations. The New York Times article I referred to earlier states, ``..... the wonders of telecommunications technology--distance learning, telemedicine, the Internet--offer a way out of the `old India','' where illiteracy, disease, and poverty punctuate the countryside. This scenario is not isolated to India, but may be applied to many developing nations throughout the world. In each instance, a big part of the solution is the deployment of modern telecommunications technology. 
   The USTTI has been working to bring modern telecommunication services to the developing world for 18 years. The USTTI has offered 935 tuition-free courses and has graduated 5,574 men and women who are now helping to make modern telecommunications a reality in their 161 respective countries. The program participants are government officials responsible for developing and implementing telecommunications policies in their countries. 
   By allowing developing countries to capitalize fully on the increased educational opportunities provided through the USTTI, countries prosper economically and connect themselves to the modern world.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Tunisia, an old and devout friend and ally to the United States. March 20, 2000 marked Tunisia's 44th anniversary of Independence. 
   In 1797, Tunisia and the newly independent United States signed a ``treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation.'' The pact provided for ``perpetual and constant peace'' between the parties. For more than 200 years, our two nations have enjoyed such a relationship. During World War II, Tunisia suppressed nationalistic sentiment to join the ranks of the Allied Forces and then supported western democratic ideals during the Cold War proving the U.S. could count on Tunisia. If all our foreign relationships were as faithfully observed as this one, our foreign relations would be more serene. 
   In the face of the ever-present strife that surrounds Tunisia, with its location between Algeria and Libya, the country has managed to maintain internal stability. With its steadily increasing economic growth, Tunisia has built a stable middle class society. This growth has allowed Tunisia to become a strategic partner in the growing African market. 
   The United States has benefitted greatly from its strong and prosperous relationship with Tunisia. We can not forget our friend in Africa who has stood by our side throughout our country's history.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am fully aware that this is a busy year, the year we elect a new President. I also realize that one-third of our colleagues will be up for reelection or will be involved in the election for the seat from which they are retiring. As a result, all of us are striving to close this shop as soon as possible and go home. However, we do have important unfinished business with the Judiciary. 
   The Judiciary is the critical third branch of our government. Just as it is important that we hold an election this year, it is important that we fill the vacancies in our court system. I can not speak of vacancies in other districts or other circuits, but I believe I can speak of vacancies in the Ninth Circuit. Hawaii is part of the Ninth Circuit. Since the retirement of Judge Choy in 1984, Hawaii has not been represented on that bench by a full-time Circuit Judge. The law of the United States requires that at least one member of the bench of each state be represented on the Circuit Court, that there be a judge from Hawaii on the Ninth Circuit. 
   The Hawaii delegation has submitted the name of James Duffy. I have no idea whether Mr. Duffy is a Democrat or Republican. I have not asked him. However, his reputation as a skilled lawyer is well-established in our islands. Mr. Duffy was born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the College of Saint Thomas and earned his Juris Doctorate from Marquette University Law School in 1968 where he served on the Board of Editors of the Law Review. Upon graduation, he came to Hawaii to begin his career. He has spent his legal career in private litigation practice, doing both plaintiff and defense representation, for more than 31 years. He has served the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawaii as a court-appointed Special Master in Probate, Guardianship, and Family Court Proceedings, as a Special Master for Discovery Rulings in civil cases, and as a Mediator. Mr. Duffy has also served in leadership roles in legal organizations, educational organizations, and even as a judge in the Hawaii High School Rodeo Association. In his spare time, he and his wife, Jeanne, breed and sell quarter horses and Brahma cattle. Mr. Duffy is a vital part of the Hawaii legal and civic community. 
   Jim Duffy was nominated by the President for a position on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 17, 1999. I have been advised that the American Bar Association has finished reviewing his credentials. Mr. Duffy was unanimously given the ABA's highest grade of ``well-qualified.'' The Board of Directors of the Hawaii State Bar Association also unanimously reported that Mr. Duffy was well-qualified. In fact, in a letter to the Chairperson of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the HSBA President wrote, ``[f]or what it's worth, my Board expressed dismay that there wasn't a category called `the very best.' We consider Jim to be the best of the best.'' 
   Both Democrats and Republicans in my state, regard Jim Duffy as one of Hawaii's best lawyers. I do hope the Judiciary Committee will give Mr. Duffy a hearing and expedite the consideration of his nomination. This will provide its members the opportunity to meet him and review his credentials and skills. I am convinced the members will be impressed by him. I am equally convinced that Mr. Duffy will be a good judge.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Kuakini Medical Health System as it celebrates its 100th anniversary caring for Hawaii's people. Kuakini began as an ethnic charity hospital founded by Japanese immigrants who arrived in Hawaii to labor in the thriving sugar cane fields. Plantation wages were low and many newcomers found themselves unable to afford medical care. The Japanese Benevolent Society provided emergency relief to the immigrants, but a fire destroyed their facilities in January, 1900. Undaunted, the Japanese Benevolent Society started plans to build a charity hospital. Funds were raised through membership dues and community donations. Half an acre of land was purchased in Kapalama and a two-story wooden building housing 38 patient beds was completed by July, 1900. This humble beginning was the start of Kuakini Health System. 
   As the last existing hospital in the United States established by Japanese immigrants, Kuakini is unique among health institutions in the United States and Hawaii. There have been many changes during the past century, but the commitment of the health professionals and volunteers of Kuakini Health System to meet the health care needs of Hawaii's community has not waivered. Kuakini Health System has expanded to embrace and serve Hawaii's community without regard to ethnicity, disability, age, sex, religious affiliation, or financial status. Kuakini Health System is in the company of only 5 percent of all U.S. hospitals having a heavy Medicare caseload. Sixty-five percent of the hospital's admissions are Medicare patients and Kuakini's hospital cares for the largest composition of elderly patients among Hawaii's hospitals. 
   Kuakini Health System is a teaching facility, training health professionals in the precepts of compassion and quality in health care. Guests from around the world tour Kuakini to learn American health care and specific methods for health care. Kuakini includes the community in its educational goals with health and wellness fairs, health and prevention education classes, an information hotline, Internet access to information, Speakers Bureau Program and Open House aimed at giving students a first hand look at the different departments and professions within a health care organization. By bringing health awareness to our community, Kuakini contributes to the overall health and well-being of Hawaii's people. 
   Kuakini Health System strives for excellence. Federal funds support nationally and internationally recognized medical research and health programs  sponsored by Kuakini Medical System, such as the Japan-Hawaii Cancer Study, Women's Health Initiatives, and Honolulu Heart Program. Kuakini is regarded as a leader in the areas of cancer treatment, cardiac services, geriatric care, pulmonary disease treatment, gastroenterology services, health research, orthopedic surgery, telemedicine and cyberhealth. Kuakini Health System performs its health services without a major endowment or an affiliation with a larger organization for financial support. 
   The Kuakini Health System has met the health needs and challenges of Hawaii's community for the past 100 years. As we start a new century and a new millennium, I am confident that Kuakini Health System will continue to make valuable contributions to the health of Hawaii and the United States through its commitment to benevolence, research, education, and excellence.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I congratulate the Kuakini Medical Center Auxiliary on its 111th anniversary of service to Hawaii's community. From a modest beginning in 1889, the Kuakini Medical Center Auxiliary has grown to the largest active group of volunteers of a health care organization in Hawaii. The roots of the Kuakini Medical Center Auxiliary are closely tied to the charitable beginnings of Kuakini Medical Center. They form an indispensable century old team caring for the health of Hawaii's people. 
   In today's busy world time is at a premium, yet these volunteers manage to provide essential support services to the Kuakini Health System, such as transporting patients, distributing patient meals, errands, sewing, tagging medical supplies, and collating medical research. Volunteers furnish comfort and companionship to patients and residents in need. On holidays and special occasions, volunteers create favors for patients' meal trays to brighten the day. 
   In addition to the compassionate services provided, the Kuakini Medical Center Auxiliary assists the Kuakini Health System financially. Proceeds from the Gift Shop and numerous fundraising events are donated to Kuakini Foundation. Since 1980, the auxiliary has awarded more than $20,000 in scholarships to Kaukini employees to further their education. More than a million dollars has been raised for Kuakini Health System since 1971 by the Kuakini Auxiliary. 
   Currently, the Kuakini Medical Center Auxiliary has over 600 active members contributing at least 67,000 hours annually. The savings in labor costs are estimated at more than $860,000 annually, but the selfless sacrifice and caring contribution that these volunteers provide are priceless gifts to Hawaii's community. I compliment and thank the volunteers of the Kaukini Medical Center Auxiliary for the 111 years of concerned meritorious public service they have rendered to Hawaii's community.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to join with my distinguished colleagues from California, Senator FEINSTEIN and Senator BOXER, in introducing legislation that would provide a permanent land base for the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe. 
   For thousands of years the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe has lived in and around the area that is now Death Valley National Park. For many years, the Tribe sought unsuccessfully to obtain a base of trust land within its aboriginal homeland area. In 1994, when the Congress enacted the California Desert Protection Act, P.L. 103-433, it set in motion a process to address the need of the Tribe for a recognized land base. Section 705(b) of the Act provided that--  
   The Secretary, in consultation with the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe and relevant Federal agencies, shall conduct a study, subject to the availability of appropriations, to identify lands suitable for a reservation for the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe that are located within the Tribe's aboriginal homeland area within and outside the boundaries of Death Valley National Monument and the Death Valley National Park as described in part A of this subchapter.  
   The study report, which finally was completed late in 1999, set forth recommendations for legislation that would implement a comprehensive, integrated plan for a permanent Homeland for the Tribe. The legislation that we introduce today would give substance to those recommendations. 
   Briefly, the bill provides for the transfer of several separate parcels of land, currently administered by the Department of the Interior and comprising approximately 7,500 acres, in trust for the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe. These parcels include: 300 acres at Furnace Creek in Death Valley National Park encompassing the present Timbisha Village Site, subject to jointly developed land use restrictions designed to ensure compatibility and consistency with tribal and Park values, needs and purposes; 1,000 acres of land now managed by the Bureau of Land Management at Death Valley Junction, California, east of the Park; 640 acres of land now managed by the Bureau of Land Management in an area identified as Centennial, California, west of the Park; 2,800 acres of land now managed by the Bureau of Land Management and classified as available for disposal near Scotty's Junction, Nevada, northeast of the Park; and 2,800 acres now managed by the Bureau of Land Management and classified as available for disposal near Lida, Nevada, north of the Park. 
   This legislation also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to purchase from willing sellers two parcels of approximately 120 acres of former Indian allotted lands in the Saline Valley, California, at the edge of the Park, and the 2,430 acre Lida Ranch near Lida, Nevada. 
   The legislation would designate an area primarily in the western part of Death Valley National Park as the Timbisha Shoshone Natural and Cultural Preservation Area, within which low impact, environmentally sustainable, tribal traditional uses, activities and practices will be authorized subject to existing law and a jointly established management plan agreed upon  by the Tribe, the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management. 
   Mr. President, this legislation will at long last provide the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe with land on which its members can live permanently and govern their affairs in a modern community, and will formally recognize the Tribe's contributions to the history, culture, and ecology of the Death Valley National Park and the surrounding area. 
   It will ensure that the resources within the Park are protected and enhanced by cooperative activities within the Tribe's ancestral homeland, and by partnerships between the Tribe and the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management, all of which will be consistent with the purposes and values for which the Park was established. 
   Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today is incomplete in that certain map references and specific acreage numbers are still being determined by the Department. However, these are minor concerns that will be addressed in the coming weeks. It is vitally important that this legislation be introduced so that a hearing can be scheduled and all interested parties will have the opportunity to review this measure prior to the hearing.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor Rear Admiral (Upper Half) Joan M. Engel as she retires after more than thirty years of active duty service in the United States Navy. Rear Admiral Engel culminates her distinguished career as the Assistant Chief for Operational Medicine and Fleet Support at the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. As the first non-physician officer in medical department history appointed to this position, Rear Admiral Engel brought a fresh dedication to improving Navy Medicine's ability to deploy health care worldwide. She formally directed sweeping changes to the missions of her subordinate commands and instituted many progressive initiatives such as: a robust Force Health Protection program; Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Environment agent threat assessment and education programs; the creation of Forward Deployed Preventive Medicine Units; the establishment of the Navy Operational Medicine Institute, a new command focused on advanced operational aviation, undersea, and surface medicine training; and the complete restructuring of Navy Medical Research and Development laboratories and programs. 
   Rear Admiral Engel was the first female, and first Nurse Corps officer, to be selected by a board to the rank of a two-star Admiral within the Navy Medical Department. She served as the Director of the Navy Nurse Corps and Assistant Chief for Education, Training, and Personnel at the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. Through collaboration with other military nursing leaders, Rear Admiral Engel ensured that a Bachelor of Science degree became the minimum level of education for entry into practice for military nurses, and championed the establishment of a military nursing constituency within the American Nurses Association. Rear Admiral Engel was instrumental in advancing the extensive Tri-Service Nursing Research Program which focuses on research to develop best practices for nursing care. Attuned to issues related to women in the Navy, her participation in the landmark 1990 Navy Women's Study Group was the catalyst for enhancing the delivery of culturally competent women's health care and increasing the number of operational assignments for Navy nurses. Her contributions are far-reaching, and will positively impact military nursing and health care for years to come. 
   Mr. President, more than fifty years ago, as I was recovering in a military hospital, I began a unique relationship with military nurses. Rear Admiral Engel embodies what I know military nurses to be--strong, dedicated professional leaders, stepping to the forefront to serve their country and committed to caring for our Sailors, Marines, Airmen, Soldiers and family members during peacetime and at war. Rear Admiral Engel's many meritorious awards and decorations demonstrate her contributions in a tangible way, but it is the legacy she leaves behind for the Navy Nurse Corps, the United States Navy and the Department of Defense for which we are most appreciative. It is with pride that I congratulate Rear Admiral Engel on her outstanding career of exemplary service.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor Brigadier General Bettye H. Simmons as she retires after twenty-nine years of active duty service in the United States Army. General Simmons culminates her distinguished career as Chief, Army Nurse Corps and Commander, United States Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine. 
   General Simmons' distinguished career began in 1971 when she entered the Army nurse Corps through the Army Student Nurse Program. Her numerous military assignments have been diverse, including leadership roles in clinical services, staff education and development, and Army Medical Service administration and policy. As the Chief, Army Nurse Corps, General Simmons demanded the highest standards for military nursing. With other military nursing leaders, General Simmons ensured that a Bachelor of Science education is the minimum qualification for entry on to active duty for any military nurse. She was the driving force behind the multi-million dollar Triservice Nursing Research Program, a program focused on research that develops best practices for nursing care. General Simmons initiated a post-deployment program for injured Army Reserve soldiers that determined the appropriate level of medical care before the soldier returns home. This program saved countless dollars in civilian health care costs and honored the commitment to care for our Reserve Forces. As Command Surgeon for Forces Command, General Simmons improved unit medical readiness by 20 percent. She redesigned the battlefield evacuation process, providing a lightweight, robust capability to ensure the right medical care is provided to the soldier at the right time and at the right place. Her contributions are far-reaching, and will impact military nursing and health care for years to come. 
   Mr. President, more than fifty years ago, as I was recovering in a military hospital, I began to understand the critical role of military nurses. General Simmons embodies what I know military nurses to be--strong, professional leaders who are committed to serving their fellow comrades in arms and their country. General Simmons' many meritorious awards and decorations demonstrate her contributions in a tangible way, but it is the legacy she leaves behind for the Army Nurse Corps for which we are most appreciative. It is with pride that I congratulate General Simmons on her outstanding career of exemplary service.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to reauthorize and extend the provisions of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act. I am joined in the sponsorship of this measure by my esteemed colleague, Senator DANIEL AKAKA. 
   Although the act was enacted into law in 1988, appropriations to implement these critically-needed health care programs and services were not forthcoming for several years. As a result, the Native Hawaiian Health care Systems are still struggling to address the overwhelming need for health care services that are designed to improve the health status of the native people of Hawaii. 
   Native Hawaiians have the highest cancer mortality rates in the State of Hawaii, as well as the highest years of productive life lost from cancer. Native Hawaiians also have the highest mortality rates in the State of Hawaii from diabetes mellitus--130 percent higher than the statewide rate for all other races. The death rate from heart disease is 66 percent higher amongst Native Hawaiians than for the entire State of Hawaii. The Native Hawaiian mortality rate associated with hypertension is 84 percent higher than that for the rest of the State. These are just a few of the health status indicators at which the health care programs and services authorized by the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act are targeted. 
   Through the training of Native Hawaiian health care professionals, and the assignment of physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, and traditional healers to serve the needs of the Native Hawaiian community, we anticipate that the objectives established by the Surgeon General--the Healthy People 2010 goals--as well as kanaka maoli health objectives--will be attained. But to do so will require a sustained effort and a continuity of authorization and support for health care services provided to our most needy population.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor Brigadier General Linda J. Stierle as she retires after twenty-nine years of active duty service in the United States Air Force. General Stierle culminates her distinguished career as the Director of Medical Readiness and Nursing Services in the Office of the Air Force Surgeon General. She is the first Nurse Corps officer to be appointed as the Director of Medical Readiness for the Air Force Medical Service. Under her direction, the medical readiness doctrine has been reengineered to be faster, lighter, and more responsive to the needs of the fighting force. Thanks to her extraordinary leadership, the Air Force Medical Service is positioned to fully support the Air Force's new Expeditionary Air Force structure in meeting current and future contingencies. 
   General Stierle's distinguished career began in 1970 when she received a direct commission in the Air Force Nurse Corps as a second lieutenant. Highlights of her diverse and challenging career include serving as Director of the Department of Nursing at two of the Air Force's largest medical centers--David Grant USAF Medical Center, Travis Air Force Base, California, and Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. Prior to her current position, she served as the Command Nurse, Office of the Command Surgeon, Air Mobility Command, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, where she provided leadership and oversight of nursing services for 12 medical treatment facilities and the worldwide Aeromedical Evacuation System. 
   Mr. President, more than fifty years ago, as I was recovering in a military hospital, I began a unique relationship with military nurses. General Stierle embodies what I know military nurses to be--strong, professional leaders who are committed to serve their fellow comrades in arms and their country. General Stierle's many meritorious awards and decorations demonstrate her contributions in a tangible way, but it is the legacy she leaves behind for the Air Force Nurse Corps for which we are most appreciative. It is with pride that I congratulate General Stierle on her outstanding career of exemplary service.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning the recent passing of Mr. Chafee. 
   Mr. Chafee was one of a kind. His life was a life of service. He served in two great wars--World War II and the Korean conflict, rising from private to captain. He served Rhode Island as a member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives and as Governor, then as its United States Senator. 
   He has left a most positive legacy for the citizens of this land to emulate. But his greatest legacy was a legacy of decency. It mattered very little to Mr. Chafee whether a proposal was made by the Democrats or the Republicans. His only question was: Is this program or project in the best interest of this nation? 
   Our nation has lost a great leader and a most dedicated public servant. The State of Rhode Island has lost its most brilliant star. But for many, many of us--we have lost a friend. I will miss him.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, on behalf of myself and Senator AKAKA, that would provide for the reauthorization of the Native Hawaiian Education Act. 
   First enacted into law in 1988 as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Native Hawaiian Education Act provides support for the education of native Hawaiian students in furtherance of the United States' trust responsibility to the native people of Hawaii. 
   Mr. President, I am sad to report that while these programs are beginning to demonstrate an improved pattern of academic performance and achievement, we still have a way to go, as the following statistics would indicate. 
   Education risk factors continue to start even before birth for many native Hawaiian children, including late or no prenatal care, high rates of births to unmarried native Hawaiian mothers, and high rates of births to teenage parents. 
   Native Hawaiian students continue to begin their school experience lagging behind other students in terms of readiness factors such as vocabulary test scores; 
   Native Hawaiian students continue to score below national norms on standardized education achievement tests at all grade levels; 
   Both public and private schools continue to show a pattern of lower percent ages of native Hawaiian students in the uppermost achievement levels and in gifted and talented programs; 
   Native Hawaiian students continue to be over-represented among students qualifying for special education programs provided to students with learning disabilities, mild mental retardation, emotional impairment, and other such disabilities; 
   Native Hawaiian continue to be under-represented in institutions of higher education and among adults who have completed four or more years of college; 
   Native Hawaiian continue to be disproportionately represented in many negative social and physical statistics indicative of special educational needs, as demonstrated by the fact that-- 
   Native Hawaiian students are more likely to be retained in grade level and to be excessively absent in secondary school; 
   Native Hawaiian students have the highest rates of drug and alcohol use in the State of Hawaii; and 
   Native Hawaiian children continue to be disproportionately victimized by child abuse and neglect; and 
   In the 1988, National Assessment of Educational Progress, Hawaiian fourth graders ranked 39 among groups of students from 39 States in reading. 
   Mr. President, because Hawaiian students rank among the lowest groups of students nationally in reading, and because native Hawaiian students rank the lowest among Hawaiian students in reading, it is imperative that greater focus be placed on beginning reading and early education and literacy in Hawaii. 
   Mr. President, there was a time in the history of Hawaii when there were very high rates of literacy and integration of traditional culture and Western Education among native Hawaiians. These high rates were attributable to the Hawaiian language-based public school system established in 1840 by King Kamehameha III. 
   Mr. President, if we are to reverse the course of these downward trends in  educational achievement and academic performance of native Hawaiian students, it is critical that the initiatives authorized by the Native Hawaiian Education Act be reauthorized.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise this morning to add my support to H.R. 2561, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2000. I believe the conference report presents an agreement that is very much in keeping with the bill that passed the Senate and I would encourage all my colleagues to support it. 
   This was a tough conference. That is an understatement. The recommendations of the House and the Senate were different in many areas. Both sides felt strongly about their respective views. As noted by my chairman, nowhere was this more evident than in the case of the F-22. For that reason, and because of the importance of this program, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the situation facing the conferees and the final outcome. 
   For 16 years, the Air Force has been researching and developing a new generation air superiority aircraft, called the F-22. The administration's budget request called for the aircraft to enter production in fiscal year 2000. 
   The House was divided in its view on this matter. The Defense authorization bill, as passed by the House and the conference agreement which followed, supported the program without adjustment. The House Appropriations Committee took a different view. 
   The committee recommended, and the House concurred in the Defense appropriations bill, that production should be ``paused'' for at least 1 year to allow for additional testing. The House eliminated all production funding for the program--an amount in excess of $1.8 billion--and reallocated these funds to other programs. Many of these were very meritorious, but they were lower priority in the view of the Defense Department.  
   The Senate fully supported the F-22 as requested and authorized. In conference, the House was adamant that production should not begin this year. The Senate understood the House's desire for additional testing on the program, but pointed out repeatedly that there was nothing in the initial phases of this program that would warrant slowing it down to await additional testing. In addition, the Senate voted that a pause would be very costly. Contracts would have to be renegotiated. Subcontractors expecting to begin production would have to stop work on the project. Restarting it would be costly even if the pause were only to last 1 year. 
   The F-22 is a highly sophisticated new aircraft with revolutionary capabilities. Those facts are not in dispute. But, these capabilities make it a very expensive program. The Senate conferees were concerned additional costs caused by delays would be so large as to force the Defense Department to cut or even cancel the program. It is ironic that after 16 years just when we are ready to begin production that some would now argue it was time to slow down the program. The differences between the two bodies were so strongly felt that it was extremely difficult to reach an agreement. 
   Finally, our chairman, acting with the advice of the leadership of the Defense Department, crafted a compromise that all parties embraced. The compromise provides $1.3 billion for the F-22. I for one would like to have seen more provided for this program, but that was the maximum to which the House would agree. 
   We have been told by the Air Force that this sum is sufficient to allow for the program to stay on track in the coming year. The conferees understand that the funds will be merged with other research and development funding to allow the Air Force to purchase another six F-22 aircraft as planned. It will also allow the Air Force to buy materials to produce 10 additional aircraft in fiscal year 2001. 
   There is language in the agreement that requires the Air Force to get approval from the Defense Acquisition Board before proceeding to purchase these aircraft. There is also language that would require the Air Force to complete certain testing before it purchases aircraft in 2001. However, that language, as noted by our chairman, would not have any effect until after the expiration of this act. 
   The conferees believe the Air Force should conduct adequate testing of the aircraft before it goes into full rate production. The precise level of that testing is an issue to be reexamined at a later date. 
   The Senate owes a debt of gratitude--a great debt of gratitude--to our chairman, Senator STEVENS. This was a tough conference. Our chairman was up to the task of defending the positions of the Senate. At the same time, he was most respectful of the views of the House. He worked tirelessly to try to reach an accommodation on this, as well as hundreds of other items. 
   A second matter that requires clarification is the overall spending in this bill. The Senate bill provided $264.7 billion in budget authority, with the estimated outlays of $255.4 billion. The House bill was nearly $4 billion higher. 
   In conference, the Senate agreed to increase the spending by $3.1 billion in budget authority and $200 million in outlays. The conferees also agreed to label $7.2 billion in budget authority as emergency spending. In so doing, the committee was able to reallocate $4.1 billion more than the original Senate allocation and $8.1 billion more than the House allocation for other discretionary domestic programs. 
   Many have stated that this bill is more than $17 billion above the amount recommended in fiscal year 1999. However, it should be noted that the Congress added $16.6 billion for Kosovo, Bosnia, and other emergency requirements in fiscal year 1999 that are not included in that calculation. 
   In comparing ``apples to apples,'' this bill is a little over $1 billion more than provided in fiscal year 1999. I, for one, would argue that this increase is very modest for the coming year. Especially when one realizes we have provided funding for an expanded pay raise, an enhanced retirement system, and additional target pay increases for many members of the military, this increase is very modest, indeed. 
   This is a good conference report. While one can find one or two things one might not support, on balance I believe it is a good compromise package. So I most respectfully urge all my colleagues to support it. 
   In closing, I would like to give a word of commendation for two members who are not Members of the Senate, but we think they are members of our family: Steve Cortese and, this man, Charlie Houy. So, Mr. President, with the help of these two special staff members, we were able to craft this agreement we present today. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. INOUYE. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   As the chairman knows, the Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Subcommittee has a strong history of support for the behavioral and social science research programs of the National Science Foundation, NSF, dating back to the beginning of this decade. Basic behavioral and social science research, which ranges from research on the brain and behavior to studies of economic decision making, has the potential to address many of our Nation's most serious concerns, including productivity, literacy, violence, and substance abuse, as well as other diverse issues such as information systems, artificial intelligence, and international relations. 
   Under his leadership and that of our colleague, Senator BARBARA MIKULSKI, the subcommittee strongly, encouraged the establishment of a separate directorate for these sciences at NSF and was instrumental in encouraging that directorate to pursue a basic behavioral science research agenda known as the Human Capital Initiative. Most recently, this subcommittee expressed strong support for the planned reorganization of the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences directorate's single research division into two separate divisions, a Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences Division, and a Social and Economic Sciences Division. This reorganization was necessary to accommodate the explosive pace of discovery in the behavioral and social sciences and to promote partnerships with other disciplines. 
   Basic research in these sciences has contributed to the Nation's economic prosperity and national security. Given the critical importance of these fields to the national interest, and recognizing the enormous strides being made in these sciences, I seek your clarification because the report language included in your committee report may be interpreted to question the value of NSF's programs in these areas. I am also concerned that the language undermines a valuable scientific enterprise. Is it the chairman's understanding that the committee report's intent is to express the committee's belief that NSF's core mission includes support for behavioral and social science research?

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this coming weekend a long time friend of mine, Mr. K. Patrick Okura, will be celebrating his 88th birthday. For the past decade, Pat has been extraordinarily active in guiding the Okura Mental Health Leadership Foundation in order to ensure that young Asian Pacific American health professionals, representing a wide range of disciplines, will have the skills and experiences necessary to eventually achieve leadership roles throughout our nation's health and human services agencies. Pat obtained his baccalaureate and master's degrees in psychology from the University of California at Los Angeles and has long been a member of the American Psychological Association which recently published a special article highlighting his monumental accomplishments. He is currently on the Board of Directors of the National Mental Health Association, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and the Japanese American National Museum. He is a past-President of the Japanese American Citizens League and founder of the National Asian Pacific American Families Against Substance Abuse. 
   In July of 1971, during the Presidency of Richard Nixon, Pat assumed the position of Executive Assistant to the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH. For the next decade, he remained at a high level policy position within the NIMH, shepherding to fruition numerous innovative mental health initiatives. He was an active participant in the deliberations of President Carter's landmark Mental Health Commission. For many of us in the U.S. Congress, those were the glory days for mental health. There was a sense of genuine excitement and optimism. Our nation was finally beginning to understand and appreciate the social and cultural aspects of health care, not to mention the importance of ensuring that all Americans should receive necessary care. Under Pat's leadership, our nation truly committed itself to the far reaching ``deinstitutionalization movement,'' an effort which would eventually bring mental illness out of the closet and ensure that all of our citizens would retain their individual civil liberties, notwithstanding any particular diagnosis, lack of economic resources, or lack of immediate family. 
   During the mid-1980s, Pat went on to serve as Special Assistant to the President of Hahnemann University, once again with a unique focus on those projects and events that made the university the great educational institution that it was. As I have already indicated, for the past decade Pat has continued to ``give back'' to our nation by ensuring that future generations of  Asian Pacific American health professionals will begin to appreciate their potential for excellence in leadership. Having had the opportunity of personally meeting with his Fellows as they come to Capitol Hill each year, I must say that I have always been extraordinarily impressed by their dedication and commitment to our nation. Pat Okura has truly been a visionary role model for all of us and the ultimate public servant. I wish him the best on this truly special occasion.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr President, it is a pleasure to have this opportunity to speak on the 35th anniversary of the Wilderness Act of 1964 and on the establishment of the National Wilderness Preservation System. 
   When the Wilderness Act was being debated on the Senate floor in 1963, I was a freshman Senator. Following Hawaii's admission to the union in 1959, I served one partial and one full term in the House of Representatives and then was elected to the Senate in 1962. So, in early April of 1963, I was a 39-year-old freshman Senator in the first year of my first term in the Senate. 
   The Wilderness Act, however, was not new to the Senate when it came to the floor in April 1963. The first wilderness proposal was introduced late in the 84th Congress in 1956. Following extensive hearings, testimony, debate and revisions, a wilderness bill was passed by a wide margin in the Senate on September 6, 1961. However, it was not until my freshman year in the Senate that we passed a wilderness bill that ultimately went on to become law the next year in 1964. 
   Just prior to the vote in the Senate on April 9, 1963, one of the floor managers of the bill, the Honorable Frank Church of Idaho, said, ``the Senate is about to vote on the question of the passage of a bill which, if enacted into law, will be regarded as one of the great landmarks in the history of conservation.'' You can imagine the effect of such far reaching and nationally significant discourse on a young man from a new state in the middle of the Pacific. 
   I have been around for a while. Yesterday was my 75th birthday. But I am not so jaded as to have lost sight of the important principles upon which the Wilderness Act was founded. 
   The bill was ultimately signed into law on September 3, 1964. To me, it seems like just yesterday, but a lot has happened since then. The Wilderness system was originally endowed with 9.1 million acres of national forest lands. In 35 years, that has grown to more than 104 million acres managed by four federal land management agencies. 
   Hawaii, obviously a very small State, has just 142,370 acres of federally designated wilderness area. This is about 1/10 of 1% of the total designated wilderness area in the country. However, let me tell you about Hawaii's wilderness and other natural areas. 
   Hawaii is the only State with bona fide tropical rain forest. Although over half of Hawaii's original native rain forest has been lost or replaced by introduced species, planted landscapes, or development, a great deal remains. Perhaps 3/4 of a million acres of rain forest is left in Hawaii. 
   Rain forest is just the start, however. There are actually about 150 distinct ecosystem types in Hawaii. These ecosystems are so distinctive that the Hawaiian Islands constitute a unique global bio-region. These ecosystems range from 14,000-foot snowy alpine deserts, to subterranean lava tube systems with eyeless creatures, to windswept coastal dunes. 
   All told, perhaps half of the 150 ecosystem types in Hawaii are considered in trouble, imperilled by human-related changes in the landscape. Most of the loss has occurred along the coasts  and in the lowlands, where the majority of human habitation exists today. 
   Hawaii is also considered to be the extinction capital of the United States. About 90% of Hawaii's native plants and animals occur nowhere else in the world, and nearly 1000 different kinds of Hawaiian plants and animals are threatened by extinction. Approximately 75% of the recorded extinctions in the United States are from Hawaii. Also, about 40% of the birds and 30% of the plants presently on the U.S. endangered species list are native to Hawaii. 
   One of Hawaii's federal wilderness areas is the 19,270-acre Haleakala Wilderness Area on the Island of Maui, which was designated in 1976. This area is part of the 28,655-acre Haleakala National Park. During the August recess, I participated in the dedication of 1,500 acres of pristine tropical habitat, which was added to Haleakala National Park thanks to the support of my Congressional colleagues who approved funds last year for its acquisition. So, Haleakala continues to grow. 
   The major feature of this park is the dormant, though not extinct, Mount Haleakala and its volcanic crater within. Stretching from an elevation of 10,000 feet to the sea, the park also includes unrivaled native forest and stream habitat, and abundant Native Hawaiian historical and cultural features. 
   The other Federal wilderness area is the 123,100-acre Hawaii Volcanoes Wilderness Area, which is part of the larger 230,000-acre Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island of Hawaii. This park, established in 1916, displays the results of 70 million years of volcanism and rises from sea level to the summit of the earth's most massive volcano, Mauna Loa at 13,677 feet. 
   Within the park is the world's most active volcano, Kilauea, which offers scientists insights into the birth of our planet and visitors views of dramatic volcanic landscapes. Molten lava from the Puu 2 O 2o 2 vent, on the flank of Kilauea volcano, flows seven miles through a lava tube to the coast where it enters the ocean, causing the sea to actually boil. Volume of flow averages about 400,000 cubic meters per day continuously adding new land to the island. 1999 is 16th year of this ongoing eruption of Kilauea. 
   More than just these designated federal wilderness areas, Hawaii has a total of 270,000 acres in the national park system; 35,000 acres in federal fish and wildlife refuges; and 109,000 acres in state natural area reserves. Added to this are other areas managed privately for conservation purposes, including approximately 25,000 acres managed by The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii. 
   Wilderness is defined in the law as areas ``where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.'' With all of the unique and imperilled species and habitat in Hawaii, I certainly understand the value of protecting our wild and natural areas, whatever the definition might be. 
   The message that I would like to leave with my colleagues as we think about the 35th anniversary of the Wilderness Act is that we all wish to be environmentalists. We often differ on the details of environmentalism; sometimes greatly. Some of the most impassioned discussions in this body have to do with environmental issues. Some of us do not receive the highest score from the League of Conservation Voters. However, I do not think any of my colleagues would say that environmental conservation is a frivolous pursuit. It is merely a question of degree. 
   So where does that leave us? I know we will continue to debate so-called anti-environmental riders, the future of the Endangered Species Act, and maybe even reforms to the 35-year-old Wilderness Act. But let us not close our minds to our perceived adversaries, nor lose sight of what I believe we all agree upon. 
   Our natural environment is a finite resource that needs to be protected and nurtured for generations to come. There are no simple solutions, but with this common goal in mind, we will make progress.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, with the greatest respect for my friend from Florida, I rise in opposition to the amendments he proposes to the Interior appropriations bill. 
   As similar amendments have done in prior years, this amendment seeks to prevent Indian tribal governments from engaging in activities that have been authorized by the U.S. Congress and sanctioned by the Supreme Court of the United States. 
   My colleagues know well that there has been a serious impasse in the operation of federal law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act--IGRA--since 1996. 
   In that year, the Supreme Court concluded that the means by which tribal governments could have recourse to the Federal courts if a State refused to negotiate for a tribal-State compact violated the states' eleventh amendment immunity to suit. 
   Thus, while there are presently over 128 tribal-State compacts as many as 24 States, in those States where tribal-State compact negotiations had not been brought to fruition by 1996, the Court's ruling gave those States a trump card in the negotiations. 
   Those States--and there are only a few--now had a means of avoiding compliance with the Federal law altogether. They could refuse to negotiate any further, or refuse to negotiate at all, with the knowledge that tribal governments had no remedy at law and no recourse to the Federal courts. 
   We have tried to address this matter through legislation, and indeed, the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, currently has a bill pending in the Senate which specifically addresses this matter and establishes a process for resolving this impasse. 
   In the interim, the Secretary of the Interior has stepped into the breach--first by soliciting public comment on his authority to promulgate regulations for an alternative process if tribal-State compact negotiations should fail, and then by following the administrative procedures to assure that everyone with an interest had an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. 
   That was the open and public and well above-board process that was followed, and it seems to me only fair that if a State refuses to negotiate with a tribal government,--that there be some other means by which an indian government can secure its right under Federal law to conduct gaming activities. 
   Mr. President, if there were a proponent of this amendment that could tell us what equitable alternative they would propose for those tribal governments that will be directly affected by this amendment, I would give that alternative my earnest consideration. 
   But all that I see going on here is an effort to assure that the windfall enjoyed by those States that had not entered into compacts by 1996, never have to do so. 
   I suggest that if what we are about here is to render the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act a nullity, then let's be direct and forthright about it. 
   Let's repeal the Federal law. 
   Let's have the Supreme Court's ruling in Cabazon be the order of the day and of every day to come.  
   I, for one, will not be party to this obvious effort on the part of some States to evade the mandates of the Federal law. 
   There is nothing constructive being advanced today. There is no effort to assure some balance in the positions of the respective sovereigns, tribal and State governments, and as such, I must strongly and respectfully oppose the adoption of this amendment. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on August 21, 1999, the State of Hawaii celebrated its 40th anniversary as the 50th State of this great Nation. 
   Statehood for Hawaii was not a sudden or impulsive idea. During the debate on statehood for Hawaii in the  House of Representatives in March 1959, there were no fewer than 88 bills pending that would have, if enacted, admitted Hawaii as a State. The people of Hawaii, through our territorial legislature, had petitioned the Congress for statehood on 17 different occasions. 
   Back in the fifties, times were very different. In those days, the concept of statehood for a group of tiny islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean seemed far-fetched to many. However, the admission of Alaska removed the doubts of those who felt the United States should be one contiguous land mass. 
   After nearly 40 years of Congressional debates, investigations, hearings, and visitations, we achieved what so many of us in the Territory of Hawaii deeply desired. The State of Hawaii has come a long way since 1959 and I am very proud of the achievements of the people of Hawaii. I believe Hawaii has proven to be a credit to our Nation. I would like to take this opportunity to give my colleagues some insight into the tremendous changes that have taken place in the 50th State over the past 40 years. 
   Hawaii has the reputation of being the ``Health State,'' and that reputation is well deserved. We lead the Nation in providing access to health care with more than 96 percent of the Hawaii population having health insurance. Hawaii leads the Nation with the lowest number of deaths from breast cancer, and ranks second in the Nation for the lowest number of deaths due to all cancers, heart disease, and diabetes. 
   Our territory of 600,000 American citizens in 1959 has more than doubled in 40 years. No territory, with the exception of Oklahoma, ever possessed a population as large as Hawaii's at the time it sought statehood in the Union. Consider these facts. In 1959, Hawaii contributed into the U.S. Treasury $166 million in taxes, putting Hawaii ahead of 10 States in taxpayer contributions. The per capita income of Hawaii was $1,821, ranking it 25th amongst the States, and the total income was more than in eight States. Current per capita income is more than 14 times that original amount, ranking Hawaii 15th amongst the States. Further, last year the people of Hawaii contributed $2.7 billion to Federal coffers in the form of taxes. 
   In 1959, sugar was king; 974,000 tons of sugar were produced in Hawaii. Though sugar is no longer king in Hawaii, agricultural has and continues to be a significant contributor to the state's economy providing nearly $3 billion in sales and more than 40,000 jobs. Sugar remains an important crop and pineapple production has been stable for many years. Additionally, diversified agriculture, including flowers, fruits, vegetables, macadamia nuts, coffee, and livestock, is a very bright spot in our State's economy. It is one of the few economic sectors experiencing growth. In 1987, diversified crops surpassed sugar in farm fate value in Hawaii and never looked back. After its pristine beaches and warm tropical waters, Hawaii's attraction lies in its green space. Without agricultural production, much of this lush green environment, many come to expect of Hawaii, would be lost. 
   With sugar's downsizing, Hawaii is taking advantage of an opportunity that has been available in the islands in 150 years, that is, agricultural land is available in large quantities. The State is now taking an unobstructed look at agriculture in its broadest sense. Beyond traditional products, Hawaii and its year-round growing capability is ripe for development of high value products like herbal dietary supplements, cosmetics, ethical drugs, specialized fruits and vegetables, and natural industrial products. There is also potential for agriculture as a service industry in the areas of bioremediation of contaminants, carbon sequestering forest production, seed testing and propagation for use worldwide, and development of innovative pest management strategies. 
   The State of Hawaii has become a world class player in the science and technology arena. Manua Kea, on the Island of Hawaii, is known internationally as the best site for optical, infrared, and millimeter/submillimeter astronomy. It is the chosen site for all four of the new generation of 8- or 10-meter class telescopes now under construction in the Northern Hemisphere. The observatories include: the Gemini project, the Keck Observatory, Canada-France-Hawaii, the Joint Astronomy Center, Subaru, Smithsonian, and the California Institute of Technology. Eight nations are represented atop Manua Kea with the United States' presence most prominent. 
   The Maui Research and Technology Park is fast earning a reputation as one of the world's most sophisticated high technology centers. MRTP is home to the Maui High Performance Computing Center, the newest of 12 national supercomputing resource centers. 
   The University of Hawaii's successful cloning of three generations of mice from adult cells stunned the international scientific community and has brought significant prestige and attention to the University and the State. 
   Forty years ago, when the Members of Congress debated the suitability of Hawaii as a state, questions were raised about our Americanism. During World War II, the loyalty and patriotism of Americans of Japanese ancestry living in Hawaii were called into question. When we finally received the call to duty in early 1943, 1,500 Hawaii volunteers were sought by the U.S. Army. In less than a week, 15,000 had volunteered, and Hawaii was not yet a State. 
   We continue our strong commitment to military service. Hawaii is home to all the services, and we continue to demonstrate our support for our nation's military as a member of our Hawaii community. We are home to the USS Missouri and the USS Arizona memorials which symbolize the beginning and end of World War II, and pay tribute to the many brave men and women who have their lives for our nation. Hawaii has been bestowed with this high honor of stewardship that we will proudly uphold. 
   Tripler Army Medical Center is a leader in medical care, medical education, and research. It has also earned national recognition for its work in telehealth technology applications, most appropriately called AKAMAI which in Hawaiian means ``brilliant or smart.'' The state-of-the-art Spark M. Matsunaga Veterans Medical Center will open in early 2000 at Tripler, and the two agencies have worked collaboratively to integrate services and information systems, providing both active duty personnel and veterans with the best medical care available anywhere. We are also very proud of the Center of Excellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance, a military-civilian partnership that facilitates joint disaster response operations through research, education, and information management. 
   It is clear that none of the concerns expressed in those years preceding statehood have become reality. Hawaii did not fall to communism. Hawaii's distance has not diminished the strength of the United States, but in fact has enhanced its military and economic power into the Asia-Pacific region. Further, Hawaii remains one of the greatest examples of a multiethnic society living in relative peace. 
   I have had the privilege of serving the people of Hawaii in the U.S. Congress since statehood. Over these years, the people of Hawaii have proven their unfailing loyalty and devotion to America's ideals. Hawaii's achievements are a testament to our desire to continually share the best of who we are and what we have to offer our fellow Americans. 
   So, as we celebrate 40 years of statehood, Hawaii looks toward the new millennium with pride, dignity and the hope for an even brighter future.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Filipino Veterans' Benefits Improvements Act of 1999. The measure would increase the disability compensation for those Filipino veterans residing in the United States. These veterans currently receive compensation at the ``peso-rate'' standard which is 50 percent of what is received by their American counterparts. Second, the measure would make all Filipino veterans residing in the United States eligible for veterans' health care. Like their American counterparts, these Filipino veterans would be subject to the same eligibility and means test requirements in order to qualify for health benefits. Third, the measure would provide outpatient care and services to veterans, Commonwealth Army veterans, and new Philippine Scouts residing in the Philippines for the treatment of service-connected and non-service connected disabilities at the Manila VA Outpatient Clinic. 
   The measure further restores funding to provide healthcare services to American military personnel and all Filipino veterans residing in the Philippines. Many of my colleagues are aware of my advocacy on behalf of Filipino veterans of World War II. Throughout the years, I have sponsored several measures on their behalf to correct an injustice and seek equal treatment for their valiant military service. Members of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were called to serve the United States Forces of the Far East. Under the command of General Douglas MacArthur, they joined our American soldiers in fighting some of the fiercest battles of World War II. Regretfully, the Congress betrayed our Filipino allies by enacting the Rescission Act of 1946. The 1946 Act, now codified as 38 U.S.C. 107, deems the military service of Filipino veterans as non-active service for purposes of any law of the United States conferring rights, privileges or benefits. The measure I introduce today will not diminish my efforts to correct this injustice. As long as it takes, I will continue to seek equal treatment on behalf of the Filipino veterans of World War II.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this month marks the 50th anniversary of the Air Force Medical Service. On July 1, 1949, the Air Force Medical Service was created, beginning a strong and rich tradition of providing health care to military personnel and their families. 
   Since the Korean War, the Air Force Medical Service has provided aerospace medicine support to our aviators. From ensuring pilots are physically fit to stand the rigors of flight to bringing physiological expertise to the design of fighter jet aircraft, aerospace medical personnel have maximized the performance and safety of our pilots. 
   Aeromedical evacuation of casualties proved valuable during World War II, and became the preferred mode of casualty evacuation during the Korean War. The Air Force Medical Service is responsible for fixed wing aircraft evacuation and manages a world-wide system for peacetime and wartime aeromedical evacuation. 
   Today, the Air Force Medical Service operates 37 medical center and hospitals and 41 clinics around the world, providing health care to a wide range of beneficiaries. When the Air Force Medical Services was created, only 4 percent of military troops had dependents. However, seventy percent of military personnel serving today have families. These dynamic changes have broadened the needs and expectations for medical services. In recent years, constrained resources and the initiation of TRICARE have added to the challenges. The Air Force Medical Service has always found innovative ways to ensure the mission was accomplished. 
   I congratulate the 52,000 men and women of the Air Force Medical Service on this milestone. I am confident that the proud traditions of the Air Force Medical Service will continue as its men and women provide the best combat medical support, aeromedical evaluation of the sick and injured, and health care to Air Force communities.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on the evening of Tuesday, May 18, 1999, the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and my good friend, Senator TED STEVENS of Alaska, received the Eisenhower World Affairs Institute's annual Leadership Award in recognition of his outstanding lifetime accomplishments. This is indeed an honor TED richly deserves. TED has dedicated his life to public service, and embodies the values, commitment and integrity that were the hallmark of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It is an honor to work with such an able legislator, particularly on the Senate Appropriations Committee, where TED's leadership has earned him the respect of his Senate colleagues. TED is a great American and serves this institution well. I was delighted to be part of the evening's festivities. I would like to share with my Senate colleagues and all Americans, Senator TED STEVENS' remarks upon the acceptance of the Eisenhower Leadership Award. I ask that the full text of Senator STEVENS' remarks be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
   The remarks follow.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to establish an American Indian Education Foundation. I am joined by Senators DOMENICI, DORGAN, CONRAD, BINGAMAN, JOHNSON, DASCHLE and AKAKA as sponsors of this measure, because we believe that this foundation will help American Indian and Alaska native students immeasurably in the years to come. 
   The foundation will be a charitable, non-profit corporation that would be authorized to: (1) encourage, accept, and administer private gifts in support of the bureau of Indian Affairs' (BIA) Office of Indian Education; (2) conduct activities that will further educational opportunities of American Indians and Alaskan natives attending BIA schools; and (3) assist Federal, State, tribal, and individual entities that will further the educational opportunities of American Indians and Alaskan natives attending BIA schools. 
   Similar foundations, such as the National Park Foundation and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation have been extremely successful over the past several years. This foundation is modeled after those foundations. 
   Indian children are the most important resource in native America. And while the bureau's elementary and secondary education facilities and curricula have improved over the past few years, there is still much that can be done to make the learning environment a better place for Indian students. 
   We want to motivate tribal students to look forward to school every day. We want them to be eager about learning. But realizing these objectives is difficult when students are forced to learn in dilapidated buildings with outdated books and broken-down or no computer equipment. The foundation will be a start in helping to address these problems. 
   There are many Americans who have asked how they can contribute to the education of Indian students, but currently, there is no formal mechanism that would enable private resources to be dedicated to the support of the bureau schools. The foundation would serve as a means for channeling private resources to provide that much-needed support. 
   Considerable thought has gone into the composition of the foundation. The board will consist of eleven directors  who must be knowledgeable and experienced in American Indian education. The Secretary of the Interior and the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs will both serve as ex officio non-voting members. 
   The foundation would be based in the District of Columbia and will meet at least once annually. The foundation will submit an annual report of its proceedings and activities to the Congress. 
   Mr. President, we feel that the foundation will provide greatly-needed opportunities to American Indian and Alaskan native students, and would urge our colleagues to support this measure.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the outstanding service to our nation of General Charles Krulak, Commandant of the Marine Corps who is about to retire. General Krulak is completing 35 years of active service in the Marine Corps since he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1964. During his service, the General obtained a Masters Degree in Labor Relations from George Washington University. He is also a graduate of the Amphibious Warfare School, the Army Command and General Staff College, and the prestigious National War College. 
   General Krulak's illustrious career included command of a platoon and two rifle companies during two tours of duty in the Vietnam conflict. He has been a battalion commander, Commanding General of a Marine Expeditionary Brigade, and the Assistant Division Commander of the 2nd Marine Division located at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. He later was assigned duties as the Commanding General of the 6th Marine Expeditionary Group and Commanding General of the 2nd Force Service Support Group. He served as the Commanding General of this Force Service Support Group during Operation Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf. In addition to these command assignments, General Krulak's professional career has included a wide variety of other command and staff assignments including a tour of duty in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the White House. 
   In June 1989, General Krulak received his first star and, three years later, he was promoted to Major General and assigned to the Marine Corps Combat Development Command at Quantico, Virginia. One year later, he was promoted to Lieutenant General. This was followed by a transfer to Hawaii and assignment as Commander, Marine Forces Pacific. It was in this role that I became personally acquainted with this Marine's remarkably high degree of professionalism. Four years ago, General Krulak became the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps, during which he led our Marines admirably and set a high degree of professionalism not only in basic training, but also throughout the entire Marine Corps. He established, demanded and obtained a high degree of moral conduct from his Marines as a direct result of his exemplary leadership. However, the General's positive attributes do not stop there. He has demonstrated a remarkable ability to visualize and plan for the weapons, equipment, doctrine, tactics, and techniques the Marine Corps will be using for decades ahead. 
   It is an honor for me to recognize the high quality of leadership this General has given our Marines these past four years. Our nation has been fortunate in having him as Commandant of the Marine Corps. 
   I know the members of the Senate will join me in paying tribute to General Krulak and wishing him and his lovely wife, Zandi well in their retirement. We will sorely miss them. 
   In addition to expressing our fond farewell to General Krulak, I want to take this opportunity to welcome the 32nd Commandant of the Marine Corps, General James L. Jones. General Jones is no stranger to the U.S. Senate. He served here in the U.S. Marine Corps Liaison office from August 1979 until July 1984. I am confident General Jones will serve our nation as Commandant in a comparable manner as his predecessor. Welcome aboard General Jones.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coral Reef Protection Act of 1999. 
   This legislation will provide one hundred million dollars over a period of five years to preserve, sustain and restore the health of U.S. coral reef ecosystems; assist in the conservation and protection of coral reefs by supporting conservation programs; and provide financial resources for those programs. Additionally, this legislation will leverage the federal dollars appropriated for these purposes by establishing a formal mechanism for collecting and allocating matching monetary donations from the private sector to be used for coral reef conservation projects. 
   The United States has substantial coral reef holdings in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans totaling more than 6,500 square miles. More than 83% of these reefs lie among the islands of Hawaii and another 10% of them live among the other American islands in the Pacific including American Samoa, Johnston Island, Palmyra Atoll, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Hawaii, alone, is home to 47 different species of coral. These coral reefs provide numerous recreational opportunities, are linked ecologically to adjacent coastal ecosystems such as mangroves and sea grasses, support substantial biodiversity, and protect shorelines from wave damage. They also support major economic activities, such as tourism and fishing, in coastal communities that generate billions of dollars annually. Despite this importance to both the environment and the American economy, little is currently known about the condition of coral reefs in the United States. Two points, however, are clear: coral reefs are threatened whenever they are close to large concentrations of people, and coral reefs are in decline.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I join my chairman, Mr. STEVENS, in opposition to the McCain amendment. In the statement made by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, he mentioned a brown tree snake, $1 million to either control or to rid the State of Hawaii of this menace. 
   The history of the brown tree snake is a rather simple one, and it has been documented. It was found in Solomon Islands and during the war, army transport vessels accidentally or otherwise carried several brown tree snakes from the Solomon Islands to Guam. 
   Within 2 years, seven species of birds have been wiped out on Guam, babies have been threatened, and there is a brownout almost once an evening because of brown tree snakes. 
   The State of Hawaii has no snakes unless they are brought in. It has been documented that the brown tree snake was brought in from Guam via the Air Force aircraft. Therefore, the Department of Defense, assuming some responsibility for this, has not disapproved this amount of $1 million to help the State of Hawaii rid itself of the brown tree snakes. 
   Hawaii's environment is such that it is rather fragile. We have no natural predators to control the snakes, and if it ever gets loose in my State, then all the beautiful birds of paradise will disappear. 
   I think the amount we have put in this bill represents the position on the part of the Department of Defense in assuming responsibility is a rather small one. 
   I hope my colleagues will join us in opposing the McCain amendment.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared by both sides and the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. I ask that it be considered and passed. 
   With Chairman STEVENS' agreement, included in the managers' package of amendments is bill language that would provide authority to replicate the Federal Health Care Partnership that is now operating in the State of Alaska. 
   Pursuant to the Alaska Federal Health Care Partnership, the Department of Defense (DoD), the Veterans' Administration (VA) and the Indian Health Service (IHS) have entered into memoranda of understanding in order to make the most efficient use of resources that are made available to each of these Federally-funded health care systems in the provision of health care services to their respective eligible beneficiaries. Initiated in April of 1995, under this partnership, health care services are being provided to eligible DoD, VA and IHS beneficiaries without regard to the designation of the health care service facility, and telemedicine technologies are being employed to provide access to health care services in remote rural areas. 
   The proposed bill language would provide authority for the Department of Defense to establish a similar arrangement with the Veterans' Administration and Federally-funded health care agencies providing health care services to Native Hawaiians in the State of Hawaii. For the purpose of this partnership, Native Hawaiians shall have the same status as other Native Americans who are eligible for the health care services provided by the Indian Health Service. 
   The proposed bill language also provides authority for the Department of Defense to develop a consultation policy with regard to programs and activities which affect the Native Hawaiian community in Hawaii. 
   On May 14, 1998, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13084, directing every Federal agency to establish an effective process to provide for meaningful and timely consultation and coordination with Native Americans and Native American governments in the development of policies and practices that significantly or uniquely affect their communities. On October 20, 1998, the Secretary of the Department of Defense announced the issuance of the Department's consultation policy affecting two of the three constituent Native American groups--American Indians and Alaska Natives. The proposed bill language authorizes the Department of Defense to develop a similar consultation policy for the third constituent group of Native Americans--Native Hawaiians--for the purpose of assuring maximum Native Hawaiian participation in the direction and administration of governmental services so as to render those services more responsive to the needs of the Native Hawaiian community, consistent with the following findings of the Congress---- 
   The United States recognizes and affirms that American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian people, as the aboriginal, indigenous, native people of the United States have a continuing right to autonomy in their own affairs and an ongoing right of self-determination and self-governance. 
   The Constitutional authority of the Congress to legislate in matters affecting the aboriginal, indigenous, native people of the United States includes the authority to legislate in matters affecting the Native Hawaiian people, as aboriginal, indigenous, native people who have a special relationship with the United States. 
   The Federal policy of self-determination and self-governance of the aboriginal, indigenous, native people of the United States is intended to maximize the participation of native people in the direction and administration of governmental services to their communities in order to make those services more responsive to the needs of the native people and their communities. In accordance with that policy, the Congress encourages Federal agency consultation with the aboriginal, indigenous, native people of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians, with regard to agency actions that uniquely or significantly affect them or their communities. 
   For purposes of these sections in the proposed bill language, the term ``Native Hawaiian'' means any individual who is a descendant of the aboriginal people who, prior to 1778, ``occupied and exercised sovereignty in the area that now comprises the State of Hawaii.'' 
   I thank the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator STEVENS, for his willingness to assure that the Department of Defense has a consistent policy as it relates to all Native Americans.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I have been trying to follow this debate as closely as possible. The explanation the Senator from California has given is that this amendment would strike provisions in the bill which allow the Secretary of the Air Force to lease six Gulfstream V jets to transport the highest ranking military officials. 
   There is nothing in Section 8106 that speaks of six Gulfstream V jets, nor does it speak of the highest ranking military officials. I have no idea where that came from. 
   What this section says is:  
   The Secretary of the Air Force may obtain transportation for operational support purposes, including transportation for combatant Commanders in Chief, by lease of aircraft, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may deem appropriate, consistent with this section, through an operating lease consistent with OMB Circular A-11.  
   There is nothing about Gulfstreams. There is nothing about the highest ranking military officials. But even if we did say six Gulfstream V jets for the highest military officials, I join my chairman in objecting to this amendment. We should keep in mind that fewer than 1 percent of the population of these United States have stood up and said to the rest of the world they are willing to stand in harm's way in our defense and, if necessary, give their lives. Fewer than 1 percent of us have taken that oath. The least we can do is to give them the cutting edge, and this is the cutting edge that is necessary to differentiate between defeat and victory. 
   So, Mr. President, I will support a motion to table this amendment.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to address the question of strategic airlift. In this bill, the Managers have attempted to accelerate and increase funding for new modern programs, specifically the C-17, in lieu of investing scarce resources in older aircraft. 
   Mr. President, currently C-17s are only assigned to a few bases. We recognize some members are concerned that by focusing on the C-17, those strategic airlift bases without C-17s will suffer. I recognize this legitimate concern and want to ask the Chairman his views on the basing of C-17 aircraft. Would the Senator agree with me that C-17s should be assigned to additional bases to replace aging C-141 and C-5 aircraft?

I recognize the importance of investing in logistics technologies that can extend our military capabilities and can lower the logistics burden for the Air Expeditionary Force Deployment concept. 
   I agree with my colleague that development of the PBO fuel cell membrane material is important. The membrane is a critical component of the fuel cell, in terms of its performance and cost. Improvements to the fuel cell membrane will result in direct benefits to our military readiness.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, before I proceed, I thank my colleague from Alaska for his very generous remarks. 
   I will take a few moments to discuss the DOD appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. Let me begin by congratulating our chairman, Senator TED STEVENS of Alaska. 
   To meet our Senate leaders' desire, the chairman and his staff expedited the review and preparation time and put this bill together. Then, after they had crafted a very good package, as you know, we were told to reduce this package by $3 billion. We had to go back to the drawing board again. 
   When one takes into consideration how this package was reshaped to meet those very difficult goals, I believe the committee has prepared the best bill that could have been recommended. 
   First of all, if adopted, it will fulfill the committee's No. 1 priority. It will provide adequate funding to ensure that our men and women in the armed services are fairly compensated. It also will provide sufficient funding so that they can be well prepared, trained, and ready to meet the Nation's requirements. 
   This bill funds a 4.8-percent pay raise, the largest percentage increase since the early 1980s. This increase is between 2 and 3 percent more than current forecasts of inflation. The bill also funds changes in the military retirement system and reforms the pay table sought by the administration. 
   The total funding in the bill represents an increase of $1.4 billion above the President's budget request. In addition to fully funding the needs of our military personnel, the bill provides $300 million for additional medical research: As the chairman indicated, $175 million for breast cancer research; $75 million for prostate cancer research, and $50 million to cover many of the high-priority medical research programs of interest to the Members. 
   More than $2.8 billion is added for procurement for two more F-16 aircraft, 15 more Black Hawk helicopters, and a half-billion-dollar downpayment in the next Marine amphibious assault ship, the LXD-8. 
   For research for new technology, the bill is $2 billion over the President's request. This includes $400 million for missile defense and related programs.  
   The bill before us does not match, dollar for dollar, the authorization bill we approved last month, but it is in general quite consistent with the recommendations of the authorizing committee. 
   To my colleagues on my side of the aisle, I realize that the bill provides funds in some areas which you may not all endorse fully. But, in total, the bill offers a good balance between current operations and future modernization. It funds both the needs of the military and the priorities of the Congress. I believe it is a very good bill that we should all support. 
   In closing, may I just add a footnote to my remarks. 
   Senator STEVENS and I are two of the few remaining Members who served in World War II, the ``ancient'' war. In that war, over 10 percent of our Nation's population stepped forward to put on the uniform of the armed services. Today, fewer than 1 percent have done so. 
   Today's military force is an All Volunteer Force. But beyond that, there are other vast differences. 
   In my youth, only 4 percent of my regiment had dependents. The remaining 96 percent were single men. Today, the average is about 70 percent with dependents. Therefore, it is essential that we provide in areas that were not considered during World War II, such as day care centers and hospitals. 
   In the hospital in which Senator STEVENS and I spent some time, there were just men--men in uniform. It may be of interest to Members to note that today at Walter Reed, 14 percent of the beds are occupied by active-duty personnel, and 86 percent are occupied by dependents and retirees. There are more gynecologists in hospitals today than orthopedic surgeons, and there are more pediatricians than orthopedic surgeons. That is a difference of which most Members of the Senate, and I believe most Americans, are not aware. 
   The largest cost of defense is not missiles; it is not bullets; it is not ships; it is personnel; it is people. If we want the best military, men and women who are willing to step forward in harm's way and, if necessary, give their lives for our Nation, then we should be able to provide the very best--not just in pay, but make certain that their health care and educational system are the finest. 
   We use the phrase ``quality of life'' quite often. If quality of life is not what the people receive, then I don't think we can anticipate the very best of our Nation volunteering to serve. After all, I want my son to go to college; I am certain that a man in uniform wants his son or his daughter to go to college. We should give them the same opportunity.

I have a few questions for my colleague from Alaska on Section 3021 of the bill which authorizes the Attorney General to transfer funds available to the Department of Justice to pay outstanding claims of Japanese Americans under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 and outstanding claims of Japanese Latin Americans under the settlement agreement in the case of Carmen Mochizuki et al .v. United States (Case No. 97-294C, United States Court of Federal Claims). 
   Am I correct that this provision would allow the Attorney General to pay redress of $20,000 to Japanese Americans who were interned by the United States during World War II and who filed a timely claim for redress under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988?

   Mr. INOUYE. In the case of Carmen Mochizuki et al versus United States, plaintiffs brought a class action against the United States seeking redress for Japanese Latin Americans who were interned by the United States during World War II. The United States settled this case. The settlement provides that each eligible class  member would receive a $5,000 restitution payment, to the extent there were funds available in the Civil Liberties Public Education Fund. Even though this Fund has now terminated, does this provision also allow the Attorney General to pay restitution to Japanese Latin American individuals who are found eligible under the Mochizuki settlement agreement and who filed timely claims covered by the agreement?

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am honored to rise in tribute to Mr. ``Manuel'' Katsumi Oishi who has faithfully served the Territorial Government of Hawaii and the State of Hawaii, Maui County, for 37 years. He unselfishly dedicated his time to improve his community. Born in 1926 and raised in McGerrow Camp, Puunene, Maui, Mr. Oishi is being recognized today at the McGerrow Camp Reunion for the honor that he brings his birthplace. 
   Mr. Oishi's career began with the Territorial government in 1949. In 1951, he started working for Maui County as a Clerk in the Building Department. He was promoted to Clerk for the Transportation Control Committee, then later served as Secretary. Transferred to the Civil Defense Department in 1958, he held the positions of Secretary, then Coordinator, and, in 1961, he became the Civil Defense Administrator. In 1973, while Deputy County Clerk and later as County Clerk, Mr. Oishi ensured that the county operated efficiently and unselfishly gave of his time to assist Maui residents navigate the sometimes bureaucratic maze of government. 
   Because of his love of sports and the youth of Maui, Mr. Oishi pursued a simultaneous career as The Honolulu Advertiser's sports reporter for 38 years. He diligently covered all of Maui's interscholastic sports in the evenings and on weekends. His positive stories encouraged young Maui athletes to take pride in themselves and their sports. 
   The incredibly energetic Mr. Oishi has devoted countless volunteer hours to make life a little easier and better for the residents he so dearly loves. Since graduation from Baldwin High School in 1944, Mr. Oishi has headed the planning of every class reunion. During the last 20 years, he has chaired all of the McGerrow Camp reunions on Maui, which have amassed an attendance of 250 to 300 people. Mr. Oishi's relentless efforts have resulted in former McGerrow Camp residents having a great time and experiencing a deep feeling of friendship and ohana (family). When the Selective Service System went though some trying times, Mr. Oishi volunteered for five years to help push the paperwork through and to answer those pressing questions from anxious young men and their parents. 
   His commitment to the youth of Maui is also evident in his volunteer work with the AJA Baseball League in which he held several positions on the board. In 1991, he received the Tadaichi Fukunaga Dana Award for his ``unselfish services and contributions to (his) temple and to the growth of Buddhism.'' Since 1976, he has been Editor of ``Friends of the Dharma,'' the monthly newspaper for his church, Wailuku Hongwanji Mission. 
   Although Mr. Oishi is retired from government service and The Honolulu Advertiser, he continues his invaluable service to his church and the Maui County Credit Union of which he serves as the Secretary-Treasurer. 
   Mr. Oishi's unfaltering commitment to government service and his sincere devotion to his community and its citizens bring pride and honor to McGerrow Camp. He certainly has earned the love and admiration of the residents of McGerrow Camp, the County of Maui, and the State of Hawaii. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in recognizing ``Manuel'' Katsumi Oishi for his outstanding contributions to Maui County and to the State of Hawaii and send my heartiest aloha to those celebrating the McGerrow Camp reunion.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to repeal the current fifty percent tax deduction for business meals and entertainment expenses, and to gradually restore the tax deduction to 80 percent over a five-year period. Restoration of this deduction is essential to the livelihood of the food service, travel, tourism, and entertainment industries throughout the United States. These industries are being economically harmed as a result of the 50 percent tax deduction. 
   The deduction for business meals and entertainment was reduced from 80 percent to 50 percent under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, and went into effect on January 1, 1994. Many companies, small and large, have changed their policies and guidelines on travel and entertainment expenses as a result of this reduction. Additionally, businesses have been forced to curtail company reimbursement policies because of the reduction in business meals and entertainment expenses. In some cases, businesses have even eliminated their expense accounts. Consequently, restaurants which previously relied heavily on business lunches and dinners are being adversely affected by the reduction in business meals. For example: 
   Currently, there are 23.3 million business meal spenders in the U.S. down from 25.3 million in 1989. 
   The total economic impact on small businesses of restoring the business meal deductibility from 50 percent to 80 percent ranges from $8 to $690 million, depending on the state. 
   In Hawaii, the restaurant industry alone employs 47,400 people and generates $2 billion into the state's economy. An increase in the business meal tax deduction from 50 percent to 80 percent would result in a 13 percent increase in business meal spending in the State of Hawaii. 
   One issue of great importance to business travelers is the deductibility of expenses, particularly the business meal expense. 
   Restauranteurs have reported lower business meal sales forcing some restaurants to close during luncheon hours and lay off employees which in turn adversely affects those employed in agriculture, food processing, and any businesses related to the restaurant sector. 
   With sales equaling more than 4 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product, and more than 10.2 million persons employed in the industry, the restaurant business is obviously very important to the economic foundation of America. The 50 percent deduction has adversely affected the restaurant and entertainment industry and resulted in detrimental factors for the U.S. economy as a whole. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to bring my colleagues' attention to a very exciting expedition. In September 1998, Mr. Michael ``Mick'' Bird completed the second leg of an unprecedented 24,000 mile voyage around the world. On August 19, 1997, Mick Bird started rowing out to sea from Fort Bragg, California in his vessel Reach. After 66 days of rowing, on October 23, 1997, Mick arrived in Hilo Bay on the Big Island of Hawaii. 
   After putting the Reach in drydock in Hawaii, Mick returned to his home base in California to raise support and prepare for the next leg of his historic journey. Mick returned to Hawaii last summer and put to sea in Reach on July 18, 1998 rowing for the Gilbert Islands, about 2500 miles southwest of Hawaii and halfway point between Hawaii and Australia. On September 22, 1998, 66 days and more than 2200 miles from Hawaii, Mick made landfall on Majuro in the Marshall Islands, a bit north of his intended destination in the Gilberts. Mick is now happily home in California with his family preparing for his next leg to the north central coast of Australia; another 2500 mile row. 
   Mick Bird, a former U.S. Air Force officer, is of Pacific Island descent and has family ties to the State of Hawaii. His voyage is more formally known as Trans-Oceanic, which is the name of the non-profit organization sponsoring this attempt at the world's first solo circumnavigation of the globe by a rowing vessel. The goals of this expedition are, among others, to explore the limits of the human spirit, to raise awareness about ocean ecosystems, to be an example of individual achievement as well as teamwork, and to generate support for the National Tuberous Sclerosis Association. The expedition is also using its World Wide Web sites (www.naau.com and www.goals.com/transrow) to create a direct link between Mick's vessel Reach and educators and students to share experiences and practical applications of math, science and geography. 
   I would like to congratulate Mr. Bird on his very impressive accomplishments to this point, and to express my good wishes for the safety and success of the rest of this voyage around the world. I also wish to commend him and Trans-Oceanic for enhancing public awareness and education. I encourage my colleagues to have a look at Trans-Oceanic's web sites and share them with educators at home to follow along with this amazing journey.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment proposed by Senators ENZI, SESSIONS, GRAMMs, BRYAN, LUGAR, REID, VOINOVICH and BROWNBACK, which would impose a moratorium on the Interior Secretary's authority to promulgate final regulations or to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking related to procedures which would provide a means for securing a tribal-state compact governing the conduct of class III gaming on Indian lands. 
   Mr. President, in 1988, I served as the primary sponsor of the bill that was later enacted into law as the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. That Act provides a comprehensive framework for the conduct of gaming on Indian lands, including a means by which the state and tribal governments, as sovereigns, may enter into compacts for the conduct of class III gaming on tribal lands. 
   The Act further provides that should a state and tribal government reach an impasse in the negotiations that would otherwise lead to a tribal-state compact, a tribal government or a state government could initiate a legal action in a federal district court pursuant to which a court could: (1) rule on the parties' substantive interpretations of law that gave rise to the impasse, thereby resolving the matter; or (2) order the parties to either resume negotiations or enter into a process of mediation. 
   However, in the intervening years, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that a state may assert its sovereign immunity to suit if a legal action is initiated by a tribal government, thereby divesting a federal court of its jurisdiction, and that the Congress lacks the authority to waive a state's Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit. 
   Since that time, various members of the Committee on Indian Affairs have proposed an array of alternatives to the Act's compacting process, but each time, either the states or the tribes have opposed these measures. So the Interior Secretary stepped into the breach, and invited comments on his authority to promulgate rules for an alternative means of securing the authority to conduct class III gaming on Indian lands. 
   This has been a constructive effort on the Secretary's part, for which he is to be commended. 
   Mr. President, twenty-one states have entered into compacts with tribal governments over the last eleven years. There are only a few states in which tribal-state negotiations have been frustrated, and this amendment effectively precludes those tribal governments that have yet to secure a compact, from exploring an alternative route, as prescribed by the Secretary, and gives the states an absolute veto power over tribal gaming--a result that the Act was clearly intended to avoid. 
   Not only does this amendment cut off the rights that tribes have under the Supreme Court's ruling in California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, the amendment ties the Secretary's authority to the submittal of a Commission report that has no legal on these matters. The National Gambling Impact Study Commission was authorized to examine and assess all forms of gaming in the United States, as well as gambling-related issues, including the conduct of state lotteries. 
   Mr. President, there are many of us in the Congress who are opposed to gaming, and as Indian country well knows, I include myself in the ranks of those members. Hawaii is one of only two states in our Union that prohibits all forms of gaming. But I don't see anyone in this body proposing to impose a moratorium on the conduct of state lotteries until eight months after the Commission submits its report to the Congress. 
   Nonetheless, tribal government-sponsored gaming is most analogous to the lotteries operated by state governments. Federal law--the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act--clearly and unequivocally provides that tribal gaming revenues may only be used to support the provision of governmental services by tribal governments to reservation residents--both Indian and non-Indian. 
   Mr. President, I must take exception to some of the representations that have been made about this amendment. For instance, that the amendment ``protects States' rights without harming Indian Tribes''. 
   A right to conduct gaming free of any State involvement was confirmed by the United State Supreme Court in May of 1997. Let us be clear about this--what this amendment does is take away that right. 
   The proponents of this amendment also assert that their amendment would maintain ``the status quo of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act''. However, we should also equally clear about this--this amendment does not preserve the status quo. Rather it strips tribal governments of rights that have been confirmed by the Supreme Court, and rather than preserving the status quo, it vests the states with a right they never had under the rulings of the Supreme Court or any other Federal law--namely, a veto power over the conduct of gaming on tribal lands--lands and activities over which the states do not have the right to exercise their jurisdiction. This is what the Supreme Court has ruled. This amendment would subvert the rulings of the Supreme Court in this area, and I believe our colleagues in the Senate  should be aware that the amendment does precisely that. 
   I would urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would correct an inequity in the current reimbursement rates for health care services provided to low-income Medicaid-eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives through the Indian Health Service (IHS) urban Indian health care programs. 
   Mr. President, currently, a 100 percent Federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) applies for the cost of services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries by a hospital, a clinic, or other IHS facility, under the condition that the facilities are operated by the IHS, a tribe, or tribal organization. IHS facilities which are predominately located in rural areas are eligible to receive the 100 percent FMAP, while similar services provided through IHS programs located in urban areas receive only 50-80 percent reimbursement depending on the type of service provided. 
   This legislation would address this inequity by extending the Federal medical assistance percentage to payments for IHS facilities to urban Indian  health care programs under the Medicaid program, and informal estimates indicate that equalizing the FMAP for IHS programs would cost $17 million over the next 5 years. 
   With few employment opportunities in tribal reservation communities, most Indians are literally forced to relocate and seek employment in cities, and as a result, roughly half of the total American Indian/Alaska Native population is now residing in urban areas. With that in mind, equalizing the Federal medical assistance percentage for health care provided to Medicaid-eligible Indians through the IHS urban Indian health care programs is essential. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I commend and congratulate my colleague from Mississippi for his leadership in this area. 
   Most respectfully and candidly, I must say that I have been a bit surprised and saddened by the attacks made upon this measure. This bill, in my mind, is a wake-up call. It is telling all of us that there is a threat. Anyone who studies North Korea, anyone who looks at the Soviet Union, anyone who has taken time to study the situation in Iraq and Iran, would have to conclude that there is a threat. This measure does not deploy any ballistic missile defense system. It just tells us it is about time we begin looking to the possibility of deploying a system. 
   As the author of this measure has pointed out very clearly, we would have to go through the regular process of authorization. This Senate and this Congress will have an opportunity to have a full-scale debate, to debate whether we have the funds, whether the threat is real, whether there is a necessity for this system. Then it will have to go through the appropriations process. At each level, the President of the United States will have an opportunity of either concurring or vetoing our efforts. We are not in any way short-circuiting the process that has been laid down by our Founding Fathers. We are following the process. But we are, in essence, telling our Nation: Wake up. There is a threat, and it is about time we look at it seriously. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor, not only of the amendment but of the bill itself. It is about time somebody took the leadership to do what Senator COCHRAN has been doing. So I hope my colleagues will reconsider their opposition, look at it very objectively, and I am certain they will concur with us. 
   For those who have been criticizing that this is going to be a very expensive bill, there is not a single dollar in this measure--not a single dollar. That will have to be determined at a later time if the Congress so decides. 
   I hope my colleagues on my side will join us when the final vote is taken to support this measure.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to direct your attention to a milestone soon to be celebrated by one of America's oldest friends and allies. On March 20, 1999, Tunisia observes its National Day, the 43rd anniversary of freedom from foreign control. 
   Tunisians have many reasons to be proud of their progress during these last four decades. We as Americans should share that satisfaction, because we have important common values and a long history of strong, mutually beneficial relations. 
   In fact, when Tunisia was still governed by Pasha Bey of Tunis, as a unit of the Ottoman Empire, Tunisia became one of the first treaty partners of the newly independent United States. The two nations signed a ``Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation'' in 1797. The pact provided for ``perpetual and constant peace'' between the parties. If all our treaties were as faithfully observed as this one, our foreign relations would be more serene. 
   Whether protecting Mediterranean shipping lanes against Barbary pirates, opposing the Nazi war machine in North Africa, or supporting Western interests during the Cold War, the U.S. could count on Tunisia. More than 30 years ago, Tunisia displayed great courage in urging other Arab nations to seek an equitable settlement with Israel. Tunisia later built on that pioneering stand by playing an important role as an honest broker at delicate points in the peace process. 
   You do not see many headlines or television footage about Tunisia. The reason is that news coverage of Africa and the Middle East is dominated by conflict, extremism, famine, and other calamities. Tunisia, by enviable contrast, is a quiet success. On a recent visit to Tunisia, Undersecretary of State, Stuart Eizenstat, called Tunisia a ``model for developing countries.'' He was correct. During these last 43 years, Tunisia has built a stable, middle class society. Tunisia has adopted progressive social policies that feature tolerance for minorities, equal rights for women, universal education and a first-rate public health system, and avoided the pitfall of religious extremism that has tormented so many other developing nations. 
   Under President Ben Ali's leadership, Tunisia has undertaken political reforms toward political pluralism and become the first nation south of the Mediterranean to formally associate itself with the European Union. 
   These are only some of the accomplishments of this small, resilient, forward-looking nation. We should be mindful of this enviable record. We should also take satisfaction that, 43 years ago, the United States welcomed Tunisia's independence and provided both moral and financial support. If all our investments abroad paid such dividends, the world would be a more peaceful place.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take this moment to remember an extraordinary and respected individual. I join the multitude of people who noted the passing of Morris K. Udall on December 13, 1998 with much sadness. He will be sorely missed, especially by those of us who had the great privilege of knowing him and benefiting from his goodwill and humanitarianism. 
   As a distinguished Member of the United States House of Representatives for more than 30 years, Morris K. Udall's leadership, diligent efforts and commitment to his duties have added a measure of integrity to the Congress. History should record that throughout his career, Morris K. Udall was of great intellect and a champion for those who had little voice. He was an eloquent spokesman for the rights of Native Americans, a leader in education and environmental protection, and a true advocate for all Americans who suffer from Parkinson's disease. 
   The people of Arizona have lost a true son and great friend. We will miss him. I will miss him.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, six thousand miles from where I am standing today, The Queen's Health System of Hawaii is providing health care services that benefit the residents of all the Hawaiian Islands. This year, approximately 18,000 inpatients and more than 200,000 outpatients will seek health care from The Queen's Health Systems. The organization maintains an open emergency room; admits Medicare and Medicaid patients; operates a 536-bed accredited teaching hospital; operates Molokai General Hospital; operates clinics on various islands; provides home health care; supports nursing programs at Hawaiian colleges and universities; and promotes good health practices in many other ways. 
   In 1885 Queen Emma Kaleleonalani, wife of King Kamehameha IV, bequeathed land which in large part composes the assets of The Queen Emma Foundation, a non-profit, tax-exempt, public charity. The Foundation s charitable purpose is to support and improve health care services in Hawaii by committing funds generated by Foundation-owned properties to The Queen's Medical Center, the Queen's Health Systems and other health care programs benefiting the community. 
   Much of the land bequeathed by Queen Emma to the Foundation is encumbered by long-term, fixed rent commercial and industrial ground leases. As these leases expire, the land and improvements revert back to the Foundation. The existing, aged improvements thereon will need to be upgraded in order to enhance and continue the revenue-generating potential of the properties. However, the Foundation's available cash and cash flow are insufficient to implement these improvements which would result in increased financial support to The Queen's Medical Center, The Queen's Health Systems and other health care programs benefiting the community. If the Foundation borrows the funds, any income generated from those improvements would be subject to the debt-financed property rules of the unrelated business income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Since the income would be taxed at the corporate rate, the amount ultimately available to The Queen's Health System would be greatly reduced. 
   Consequently, the generosity and intent of Queen Emma more than 100 years ago are being frustrated by federal tax provisions intended to prevent abuses. I am sure the Congress never intended the unfortunate consequences these provisions are having on what is virtually the sole source of private financial support for this sound and unique system of providing and delivering health care to the people of Hawaii. 
   Current law already allows an exception from the debt-financing rules for certain real estate investments of pension trusts as well as an exception for educational institutions and their supporting organizations. The legislation I am introducing today grants similar relief to institutions like The Queen Emma Foundation which provide and deliver health care to the people of our nation.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, for nearly three years, the people of Guam endured war time atrocities and suffering. As part of Japan's assault against the Pacific, Guam was bombed and invaded by Japanese forces within three days of the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor. At that time, Guam was administered by the United States Navy under the authority of a Presidential Executive Order. It was also populated by then-American nationals. For the first time since the War of 1812, a foreign power invaded United States soil. 
   In 1952, when the United States signed a peace treaty with Japan, formally ending World War II, it waived the rights of American nationals, including those of Guamanians, to present claims against Japan. As a result of this action, American nationals were forced to seek relief from the Congress of the United States. 
   Today, I rise to introduce the Guam War Restitution Act, which would amend the Organic Act of Guam and provide restitution to those who suffered atrocities during the occupation of Guam in World War II. There are several key components to this measure. 
   The Restitution Act would establish specific damage awards to those who are survivors of the war, and to the heirs of those who died during the war. The specific damage awards would be as follows: (1) $20,000 for death; (2) $7,000 for personal injury; and (3) $5,000 for forced labor, forced march, or internment. 
   The Restitution Act would also establish specific damage benefits to the heirs of those who survived the war and who made previous claims but have since died. The specific damage benefits would be as follows: (1) $7,000 for personal injury; and (2) $5,000 for forced labor, forced march, or internment. Payments for benefits may either be in the form of a scholarship, payment of medical expenses, or a grant for first-time home ownership. 
   This Act would also establish a Guam Trust Fund from which disbursements will be made. Any amount left in the fund would be used to establish the Guam World War II Loyalty Scholarships at the University of Guam. 
   A nine member Guam Trust Fund Commission would be established to adjudicate and award all claims from the Trust Fund. 
   The United States Congress previously recognized its moral obligation to the people of Guam and provided reparations relief by enacting the Guam Meritorious Claims Act on November 15, 1945 (Public Law 79-224). Unfortunately, the Claims Act was seriously flawed and did not adequately compensate Guam after World War II. 
   The Claims Act primarily covered compensation for property damage and limited compensation for death or personal injury. Claims for forced labor, forced march, and internment were never compensated because the Claims Act excluded these from awardable injuries. The enactment of the Claims Act was intended ``to make Guam whole.'' The Claims Act, however, failed to specify postwar values as a basis for computing awards, and settled on prewar values, which did not reflect the true postwar replacement costs. Also, all property damage claims in excess of $5,000, as well as all death and injury claims, required Congressional review and approval. This action caused many eligible claimants to settle for less in order to receive timely compensation. The Claims Act also imposed a one-year time limit to file claims, which was insufficient as massive disruptions still existed following Guam's liberation. In addition, English was then a second language to a great many Guamanians. While a large number spoke English, few could read it. This is particularly important since the Land and War Claims Commission required written statements and often communicated with claimants in writing. 
   The reparations program was also inadequate because it became secondary to overall reconstruction and the building of permanent military bases. In this regard, the Congress enacted the Guam Land Transfer Act and the Guam Rehabilitation Act (Public Laws 79-225 and 79-583) as a means of rehabilitating Guam. The Guam Land Transfer Act provided the means of exchanging excess federal land for resettlement purposes, and the Guam Rehabilitation Act appropriated $6 million to construct permanent facilities for the civic populace of the island for their economic rehabilitation. 
   Approximately $8.1 million was paid to 4,356 recipients under the Guam Meritorious Claims Act. Of this amount, $4.3 million was paid to 1,243 individuals for death, injury, and property damage in excess of $5,000, and $3.8 million to 3,113 recipients for property damage of less 
   than $5,000. 
   On June 3, 1947, former Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes testified before the House Committee on Public Lands relative to the Organic Act, and strongly criticized the Department of the Navy for its ``inefficient and even brutal handling of the rehabilitation and compensation and war damage tasks.'' Secretary Ickes termed the procedures as ``shameful results.'' 
   In addition, a committee known as the Hopkins Committee was established by former Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal in 1947 to assess the Navy's administration of Guam and American Samoa. An analysis of the Navy's administration of the reparation and rehabilitation programs was provided to Secretary Forrestal in a March 25, 1947 letter from the Hopkins Committee. The letter indicated that the Department's confusing policy decisions greatly contributed to the programs' deficiencies and called upon the Congress to pass legislation to correct its mistakes and provide reparations to the people of Guam. 
   In 1948, the United States Congress enacted the War Claims Act of 1948 (Public Law 80-896), which provided reparation relief to American prisoners  of war, internees, religious organizations, and employees of defense contractors. The residents of Guam were deemed ineligible to receive reparations under this Act because they were American nationals and not American citizens. In 1950, the United States Congress enacted the Guam Organic Act (81-630), granting Guamanians American citizenship and a measure of self-government. 
   The Congress, in 1962, amended the War Claims Act to provide benefits to claimants who were nationals at the time of the war and later became citizens. Again, the residents of Guam were specifically excluded. The Congress believed that the residents of Guam were provided for under the Guam Meritorious Claims Act. At that time, there was no one to defend Guam, as they had no representation in Congress. The Congress also enacted the Micronesian Claims Act for the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, but again excluded Guam in the settlement. 
   In 1988, the now inactive Guam War Reparations Commission documented 3,365 unresolved claims. There are potentially 5,000 additional unresolved claims. In 1946, the United States provided more than $390 million in reparations to the Philippines, and more than $10 million to the Micronesian Islands in 1971 for atrocities inflicted by Japan. 
   In addition, the United States provided more than $2 billion in postwar aid to Japan from 1946 to 1951. Further, the United States government liquidated more than $84 million in Japanese assets in the United States during the war for the specific purpose of compensating claims of its citizens and nationals. The United States did not invoke its authority to seize more assets from Japan under Article 14 of the Treaty of Peace, as other Allied Powers had done. The United States, however, did close the door on the claims of the people of Guam. 
   A companion measure to my bill, H.R. 755, was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative ROBERT UNDERWOOD. The issue of reparations for Guam is not a new one for the people of Guam and for the United States Congress. It has been consistently raised by the Guamanian government through local enactments of legislative bills and resolutions, and discussed with Congressional leaders over the years. 
   The Guam War Restitution Act cannot fully compensate or erase the atrocities inflicted upon Guam and its people during the occupation by the Japanese military. However, passage of this Act would recognize our government's moral obligation to Guam, and bring justice to the people of Guam for the atrocities and suffering they endured during World War II. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that would allow Filipino World War II veterans to receive 75 percent of their Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits after moving back to the Philippines. The reduced benefits reflect the lower cost of living and per capita income in the Philippines. In order to be eligible, Filipino veterans must be receiving SSI benefits as of the date of enactment of this legislation, and must have served in the Philippine Commonwealth Army and recognized guerilla units during World War II before December 31, 1946. Under current law, individuals who receive SSI benefits must relinquish those benefits should they choose to reside outside the United States. 
   There are approximately 25,000 Filipino veterans who became naturalized citizens under the Immigration Act of 1990. Due to their age, the 1990 Act was subsequently amended to allow these veterans to be naturalized in the Philippines. It is unclear how many Filipino veterans reside in the United States as a result of the 1990 Act. However, some veterans came with the expectation of receiving pension benefits and a recognition of their military service. Instead, many are on welfare, living in poverty-stricken areas, and financially unable to petition their families to immigrate to the United States. Passage of this measure would help provide for these veterans upon return to their families in the Philippines. 
   As some of my colleagues know, I am an advocate for the Filipino veterans of World War II. I have sponsored several measures on their behalf to correct an injustice and seek equal treatment for their valiant military service in our Armed Forces. Members of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were called into the service of the United States Forces of the Far East, and under the command of General Douglas MacArthur joined our American soldiers in fighting some of the fiercest battles of World War II. Regretfully, the Congress betrayed our Filipino allies by enacting the Rescission Act of 1946. The 1946 Act, now codified as 38 U.S.C. 107 deems the military service of Filipino veterans as not active service for purposes of any law of the United States conferring rights, privileges or benefits. The measure I introduce today will not diminish my efforts to correct this injustice. As long as it takes, I will continue to seek equal treatment on behalf of the Filipino veterans of World War II.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the law of the land, specifically section (1) of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, declares that the United States shall have a merchant marine sufficient to, among other things, carry a substantial portion of our international waterborne commerce and to serve as a fourth arm of defense in time of war and national emergency. 
   The importance of these requirements has been dramatically illustrated by the vital role of our merchant marine in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and most recently in Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia. 
   While the privately owned and operated U.S.-flag merchant marine has performed so magnificently and effectively in times of crisis, it has also made extraordinary efforts to ensure that a substantial portion of commercial cargo bound to and from the United States moves on U.S. vessels. Given the chronic overtonnaging in international shipping, cut-throat competition, and the competitive edge our trading partners give their national flags, this has not been easy. In addition to competition with subsidized foreign carriers, U.S.-flag carriers are forced to complete with flag of convenience carriers. Over two-thirds of the  international vessels operating in commerce are operating under flags of convenience. Flag of convenience registries include such major maritime powers as Panama, Liberia, the Marshall Islands, and Vanuatu. These registries only require their vessel owners to pay registration fees. Shipowners are not required to pay tax on revenues earned and employees do not have to pay income tax. Further, the shipowner has little or no obligation to comply with the law of the nation of registry. 
   Nevertheless, if our commercial fleet is to continue to be an effective auxiliary in times of war or national emergency, it must first be commercially viable in times of peace. Otherwise, there will be no merchant fleet when the need arises. 
   I think we all would agree that there is a substantial national interest in promoting our merchant fleet. I think, also, that we would all agree that U.S. national security and economic security interests should not be held hostage by insufficient U.S.-controlled sealift assets. Given the diminution of the flag fleets of our NATO allies it will be more important in the future to sustain a viable U.S.-flag presence. Indeed, several laws of our land recognize that national interest and spell out specifically how the U.S. government is to go about promoting it. Federal laws require that U.S. military cargo, cargo purchased with loan funds and guarantees from the Export-Import Bank, 75 percent of concessionary agricultural cargo, and at least 50 percent of all other international ocean borne cargo generated directly or indirectly by the federal government be carried on U.S.-flag vessels. The alarming news is that according to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) the total volume of cargo moving under these programs is declining and will continue to do so. 
   According to a report by Nathan Associates, Inc., the 1992 economic impact of cargo preference for the United States was 40,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs; $2.2 billion in direct, indirect and induced household earnings; $354 million in direct, indirect and induced federal personal and business income tax revenues--$1.20 for every dollar of government outlay on cargo preference; and $1.2 billion in foreign exchange. 
   It is, therefore, imperative that U.S.-flag vessels carry every ton of cargo which these programs and the law intend, and in fact require, them to carry. This brings me to the reason for the resolution I am submitting today. These are two substantial problems which threaten the viability of these programs and, therefore, the viability of our merchant fleet. 
   Several agencies administering cargo reservation programs continue to evade the spirit and letter of the reservation laws by finding the law inapplicable to a particular program or employing other loopholes. 
   This problem of evasion and uneven confidence led the Congress to amend the Merchant Marine Act of 1970 to centralize monitoring and compliance authority for all cargo reservation programs in the MARAD. Nevertheless, the problem remains. Critics of the MARAD maintain the agency is too timid, and does not discharge its obligation aggressively. The MARAD, on the other hand, says it has limited enforcement powers over those government agencies which are not in compliance. 
   Recently, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered an unopposed order upon consideration of the joint motion of the parties in Farrell Lines Incorporated versus United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Sea-Land Service, Inc. The order affirms the appropriate roles of the MARAD in administering the cargo preference laws with respect to Food for Progress and Section 416(b) programs, and the USDA in complying with those laws and the MARAD's policies and regulations implementing them. 
   Mr. President, the resolution I am submitting today expresses the sense of the Senate that all of these federal agencies must fully comply with both the intent and purpose of existing cargo reservation laws, and that the MARAD should provide directions and decisions to these agencies to ensure maximum compliance with these laws.

    Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce legislation which amends Public Law 97-359, the Amerasian Immigration Act, to include American children from the Philippines and Japan as eligible applicants. This legislation also expands the eligibility period for the Philippines to November 24, 1992, the date of the last United States military base closure and the date of enactment of the proposed legislation for Japan. 
   Under the Amerasian Immigration Act (Public Law 97-359) children born in Korea, Laos, Kampuchea, Thailand, and Vietnam after December 31, 1950, and before October 22, 1982, who were fathered by United States citizens, are allowed to immigrate to the United States. The initial legislation introduced in the 97th Congress included Amerasians born in the Philippines and Japan with no time limits on their births. The final version enacted by the Congress included only those areas where the U.S. had engaged in active military combat from the Korean War onward. Consequently, Amerasians from the Philippines and Japan were excluded from eligibility. 
   Although the Philippines and Japan were not considered war zones from 1950 to 1982, the extent and nature of U.S. military involvement in both countries are not dissimilar to U.S. military involvement in other Asian countries during the Korean and Viet- nam conflicts. The role of the Philippines and Japan as vital supply and stationing bases brought tens of thousands of U.S. military personnel to these countries. As a result, interracial relations in both countries were common, leading to a significant number of Amerasian children being fathered by U.S. citizens. There are now more than 50,000 Amerasian children in the Philippines. According to the Embassy of Japan, there are 6,000 Amerasian children in Japan born between 1987 and 1992. 
   Public Law 97-359 was enacted in the hope of redressing the situation of  Amerasian children in Korea, Laos, Kampuchea, Thailand, and Vietnam who, due to their illegitimate or mixed ethnic make-up, their lack of a father or stable mother figure, or impoverished state, have little hope of escaping their plight. It became the ethical and social obligation of the United States to care for these children. 
   The stigmatization and ostracism felt by Amerasian children in those countries covered by the Amerasian Immigration Act also is felt by Amerasian children in the Philippines and Japan. These children of American citizens deserve the same viable opportunities of employment, education and family life that are afforded their counterparts from Korea, Laos, Kampuchea, Thailand, and Vietnam.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today would centralize the authority to administer our nation's cargo preference laws in the Department of Transportation. Cargo preference statutes assure U.S.-flag ships a minimum share of cargoes produced by U.S. government programs. They play an important role in ensuring our nation's economic security and the existence of a U.S.-flag merchant fleet to assist in national security during times of national emergencies. This tremendous benefit is achieved at a minimal cost. Under present law, cargo reservation is the only direct support a majority of the U.S. merchant fleet receives. I would also like to point out that a cargo preference policy is not unique. Other nations also provide their merchant fleet preference in carrying cargoes their governments generate. 
   The Maritime Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation, has been tasked with the difficult duty of monitoring the administration of and compliance with U.S. cargo preference laws and regulations by federal agencies with regard to programs generating ocean-born cargoes.  Major programs monitored include humanitarian aid shipments provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Agency for International Development, commodities financed by the Export-Import Bank, foreign military sales, and Department of Defense cargo shipped by commercial ocean carriers. These are cargoes generated exclusively by our government. 
   In the past, compliance by federal agencies with the requirements of the cargo reservation laws has been chaotic, uneven and varied from agency to agency. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy, in issuing a directive to all executive branch departments and agencies, recognized the importance of our cargo preference policy in fostering a modern, privately owned, merchant marine capable of serving as a naval and military auxiliary in time of war or national emergency. At the time, President Kennedy stated that, ``the achievement of this national policy is even more essential now because of the worldwide economic and defense burdens facing the United States.'' Never has this sentiment been more true than now.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I feel that it is imperative that our nation continue its firm commitment to those individuals and their families who have served in the Armed Forces and made us the great nation we are today. As this population ages, there is a need for a wider range of health services, some of which are simply not available under Medicare. These individuals made a commitment to their nation, trusting that when they needed help the nation would honor that commitment. The bill I am introducing today would ensure the highest possible quality of care for these dedicated citizens and their families by authorizing payment under CHAMPUS of certain health care expenses to the extent such expenses are not payable under Medicare.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Physical and Occupational Therapy Education Act of 1999. This legislation will increase educational opportunities for physical therapy and occupational therapy practitioners in order to meet the growing demand for the valuable services they provide in our communities. 
   In its most recent report, the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projected that the demand for services provided by physical therapists will increase dramatically over the next decade. According to the BLS statistics, the increase in demand for these services will create a need for 81,000 additional therapists, an 80% increase over 1994 figures. 
   The BLS also predicts an increased demand for occupational therapists. According to the BLS, by the year 2005, the increase in demand will create a need for 39,000 additional occupational therapists, a 72% increase over 1994 figures. 
   Several factors contribute to the present need for federal support in this area. The rapid aging of our nations' population, the demands of the AIDs crisis, increasing emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention, and the growth of home health care have exceeded our ability to educate an adequate number of physical therapy and occupational therapy practitioners. In addition, technological advances are allowing injured and disabled individuals to survive conditions that, in past years, would have proven fatal. 
   America's inability to educate an adequate number of physical therapists has led to an increased reliance on foreign-educated, non-immigrant temporary workers (H-1B visa holders). The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform has identified physical therapy and occupational therapy as having the highest number of H-1B visa holders in the U.S., second only to computer specialists. While the INS does not categorize occupational therapy as a separate profession when tracking H-1B visa entrants, the National Board of Certification in Occupational Therapy documents that the percentage of newly certified occupational therapists who are foreign graduates has risen from 3% in 1985 to more than 20% in 1995. 
   The legislation I introduce today would provide necessary assistance to physical and occupational therapy programs throughout the country. In awarding grants, preference would be given to applicants seeking to educate and train practitioners at clinical sites in medically underserved communities. 
   In addition to the shortage of practitioners, the current shortage of physical therapy and occupational therapy faculty impedes the expansion of established programs. The critical shortage of doctoral-prepared occupational therapists and physical therapists has resulted in an almost nonexistent pool of potential faculty. Presently, there are 117 faculty vacancies among 131 accredited physical therapy programs in the U.S. Similiarily, during the 1995-1996 academic year there were 51 faculty vacancies among 85 accredited professional level occupational therapy programs. The legislation I introduce today would assist in the development of a pool of qualified faculty by giving preference to applicants seeking to develop and expand post professional programs for the advanced training of physical and occupational therapists. 
   The investment we make through passage of the Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy Education Act of 1999 will help reduce America's dependence on foreign labor and create highly-skilled, high-wage employment opportunities for American citizens. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to enact this important legislation.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private relief bill on behalf of Donald C. Pence of Sanford, North Carolina, for compensation for the failure of the Department of Veterans Affairs to pay dependency and indemnity compensation to Kathryn E. Box, the now deceased mother of Donald C. Pence. It is rare that a federal agency admits a mistake. In this case, the Department of Veterans Affairs has admitted that a mistake was made and explored ways to permit payment under the law, including equitable relief, but has found no provision to release the remaining benefits that were unpaid to Mrs. Box at the time of her death. My bill would correct this injustice and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to amend the Public Health Service Act for the establishment of a National Center for Social Work Research. 
   Social workers provide a multitude of health care delivery services throughout America to our children, families, the elderly, and persons suffering from various forms of abuse and neglect. 
   The purpose of this center is to support and disseminate information with respect to basic and clinical social work research, training, and other programs in patient care, with emphasis on service to underserved and rural populations. 
   Social work research has grown in size and scope since the 1980's. In 1998, the National Institutes of Mental Health led the way with $17 million in funding for 61 social work research grants. Dr. Pat Ewalt, Dean of the Department of Social Work at the University of Hawaii, is one of the foremost leaders in the field of social work research and has worked diligently to gain recognition of the many important contributions of social work to mental and behavioral health care delivery. 
   While the Federal Government provides funding for various social work research activities through the National Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies, there presently is no coordination or direction of these critical activities and no overall assessment of needs and opportunities for empirical knowledge development. The establishment of a Center for Social Work Research would result in improved behavioral and mental health care outcomes for our nation's children, families, and elderly, and others. 
   In order to meet the increasing challenges of bringing cost-effective, research-based, quality health care to all Americans, we must recognize the important contributions of social work researchers to health care delivery and the central role that the Center for Social Work can provide in facilitating this process. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed on the RECORD.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Preventive Health Care Training Act of 1999, a bill that responds to the dire need of our rural communities for quality health care and disease prevention programs. 
   Almost one fourth of Americans live in rural areas and frequently lack access to adequate physical and mental health care. As many as 21 million of the 34 million people living in underserved rural areas are without access to a primary care provider. In areas where providers exist, there are numerous limits to access, such as geography, distance, lack of transportation, and lack of knowledge about available resources. Due to the divesity of rural populations, language and cultural obstacles are often a factor in the access to medical care. 
   Compound these problems with limited financial resources and many  Americans living in rural communities go without vital health care, especially preventive care. Children fail to receive immunizations and routine checkups. Preventable illnesses and injuries occur needlessly and lead to expensive hospitalizations. Early symptoms of emotional problems and substance abuse go undetected and often develop into full blown disorders. 
   An Institute of Medicine (IOM) report entitled, ``Reducing Risks for Mental Disorders: Frontiers for Preventive Intervention Research'' highlights the benefits of preventive care for all health problems. Training of health care providers in prevention is crucial in order to meet the demand for care in underserved areas. Currently, rural health care providers face a lack of preventive care training opportunities. 
   Interdisciplinary preventive training of rural health care providers must be encouraged. Through interdisciplinary training rural health care providers can build a strong foundation from the behavioral, biological and psychological sciences to form the most effective preventive care possible. Interdisciplinary team prevention training will also facilitate both health and mental health clinics sharing single service sites and routine consultation between groups. Emphasizing the mental health disciplines and their servcies as part of the health care team will contribute to the overall health of rural communities. 
   The Rural Preventive Health Care Training Act of 1999 would implement the risk-reduction model described in the IOM study. This model is based on the identification of risk factors and targets specific interventions for those risk factors. 
   The human suffering caused by poor health is immeasurable, and places a huge financial burden on communities, families and individuals. By implementing preventive measures to reduce this suffering, the potential psychological and financial savings are onormous. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nursing School Clinics Act of 1999. This measure builds on our concerted efforts to provide access to quality health care for all Americans by offering grants and incentives for nursing schools to establish primary care clinics in underserved areas where additional medical services are most needed. In addition, this measure provides the opportunity for nursing schools to enhance the scope of student training and education by providing firsthand clinical experience in primary care facilities. 
   Nursing school administered primary care clinics are university or nonprofit entity primary care centers developed primarily in collaboration with university schools of nursing and the communities they serve. These centers are staffed by faculty and staff who are nurse practitioners and public health nurses. Students supplement patient care while receiving preceptorships provided by college of nursing faculty and primary care physicians, often associated with academic institutions, who serve as collaborators with nurse practitioners. 
   To date, the comprehensive models of care provided by nursing clinics have yielded excellent results including significantly fewer emergency room visits, fewer hospital inpatient days, and less use of specialists, as compared to conventional primary health care. The LaSalle Neighborhood Nursing Center, for example, reported that in 1997, fewer than 0.02 percent of the primary care clients reported hospitalization for asthma; fewer than 4 percent of expectant mothers who enrolled delivered low birth rate infants; and 90 percent of infants and young children were immunized on time. In addition, there was a 50 percent reduction in emergency room visits and a 97 percent overall patient satisfaction rate. 
   The 1997 Balanced Budget Act (P.L. 105-33) included a provision that, for the first time ever, authorized direct Medicare reimbursement of all nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists, regardless of the setting in which services are performed. This provision built upon previous legislation that allowed direct reimbursement to individual nurse practitioners for individual services provided in rural health clinics throughout America. Medicaid is gradually being reformed to incorporate their services more effectively. 
   This bill reinforces the principle of combining health care delivery in underserved areas with the education of advanced practice nurses. To accomplish these objectives, Title XIX of the Social Security Act would be amended to designate that the services provided in these nursing school clinics are reimbursable under Medicaid. The combination of grants and the provision of Medicaid reimbursement furnishes the incentives and operational resources to establish the clinics. 
   In order to meet the increasing challenges of bringing cost-effective and quality health care to all Americans, we must consider and debate various proposals, both large and small. Most importantly, we must approach the issue of health care with creativity and determination, ensuring that all reasonable avenues are pursued. Nurses have always been an integral part of health care delivery. The Nursing School Clinics Act of 1999 recognizes the central role they can perform as care givers to the medically underserved. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to authorize the autonomous functioning of clinical psychologists and clinical social workers within the Medicare comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility program. 
   In my judgment, it is truly unfortunate that Medicare requires clinical supervision of the services provided by certain health professionals and does not allow these health professionals to function to the full extent of their state practice licenses. It is especially appropriate that those who need the services of outpatient rehabilitation facilities have access to a wide range of social and behavioral science expertise. Clinical psychologists and clinical social workers are recognized as independent providers of mental health care services through the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, the Medicare (Part B) Program, and numerous private insurance plans.

Instead of using Memorial Day as a time to honor and reflect on the sacrifices made by Americans in combat, many Americans use the day as a celebration of the beginning of summer. My bill would restore Memorial Day to May 30 and authorize our flag to fly at half mast on that day.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure which passed in the Senate toward the close of the 105th session of the Congress to amend the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act to provide Federal housing assistance to address the serious unmet housing needs of Native Hawaiians. 
   Mr. President, the primary objective of this measure is to enable Native Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands to have access to federal housing assistance that is currently provided to other eligible low-income American families based upon documented need. 
   In 1920, with the enactment of Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, the United States set aside approximately 200,000 acres of public land that had been ceded to the United States in what was then the Territory of Hawaii to establish a permanent homeland for the native people of Hawaii, based upon findings of the Congress that Native Hawaiians were a landless people and a ``dying'' people. The Secretary of the Interior, Franklin Lane, likened the relationship between the United States and Native Hawaiians to the guardian-ward relationship that then existed between the United States and American Indians. 
   As a condition of its admission into the Union of States in 1959, the United States transferred title to the 200,000 acres of land to the State of Hawaii with the requirement that the lands be held ``in public trust'' for ``the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, as defined in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920''. The Hawaii Admissions Act also required that the Hawaii State Constitution provide for the assumption by the new State of a trust responsibility for the lands. The lands are now administered by a State agency, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.  
   However, similar to the responsibility with which the Secretary of the Interior is charged in the administration of Indian lands, the United States retained and continues to retain the exclusive authority to enforce the trust and to institute legal action against the State of Hawaii for any breach of the trust, as well as the exclusive right to consent to any actions affecting the lands which comprise the corpus of the trust and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act enacted by the legislature of the State of Hawaii affecting the rights of the beneficiaries under the Act. 
   Within the last several years, three recent studies have documented the housing conditions that confront Native Hawaiians who either reside on the Hawaiian home lands or who are eligible to reside on the home lands. 
   In 1992, the National Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing issued its final report to the Congress, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change''. The Commission's Study compared housing data for Native Hawaiians with housing information for other citizens in the State of Hawaii. The Commission found that Native Hawaiians, like American Indians and Alaska Natives, lacked access to conventional financing because of the trust status of the Hawaiian home lands, and that Native Hawaiians had the worst housing conditions in the State of Hawaii and the highest percentage of homelessness, representing over 30 percent of the State's homeless population. 
   The Commission concluded that the unique circumstances of Native Hawaiians require the enactment of new legislation to alleviate and address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians, and recommended that the Congress extend to Native Hawaiians the same federal housing assistance programs that are provided to American Indians and Alaska Natives under the Low-Income Rental, Mutual Help, Loan Guarantee Program and Community Development Block Grant programs. Subsequently, the Community Development Block Grant program authority was amended to address the housing needs of Native Hawaiians. 
   In 1995, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a report entitled, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native Hawaiians''. The HUD report was particularly helpful because it compared the data on Native Hawaiian housing conditions with housing conditions nationally and with the housing conditions of American Indians and Alaska Natives. 
   The most alarming finding of the HUD report was that Native Hawaiians experience the highest percentage of housing problems in the nation--49 percent--higher than even that of American Indians and Alaska Natives residing on reservations (44 percent) and substantially higher than that of all U.S. households (27 percent). Additionally, the HUD study found that the percentage of overcrowding in the Native Hawaiian population is 36 percent as compared to 3 percent for all other households in the United States. 
   Applying the HUD guidelines, 70.8 percent of Native Hawaiians who either reside or who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian home lands have incomes which fall below the median family income in the United States, and 50 percent of those Native Hawaiians have incomes below 30 percent of the median family income in the United States. 
   Also in 1995, the Hawaii State Department of Hawaiian Home Lands published a Beneficiary Needs Study as a result of research conducted by an independent research group. This study found that among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs of Native Hawaiians eligible to reside on the Hawaiian home lands are the most severe--with 95 percent of home lands applicants (16,000) in need of housing, and with one-half of those applicant households facing overcrowding and one-third paying more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. 
   Eligibility for an assignment of Hawaiian home lands for purposes of housing, agricultural development or pasture land is a function of federal law--the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920. There are approximately 60,000 Native Hawaiians who would be eligible to reside on the home lands, but applying for an assignment of a parcel of home lands is voluntary. Because of the lack of resources to develop infrastructure (roads, access to water and sewer and electricity) on the home lands as required by State and county laws before housing can be constructed, hundreds of Native Hawaiians on the waiting list have died before receiving an assignment of home lands. 
   Once an eligible Native Hawaiian reaches the top of the waiting list, he or she must be able to qualify for a private home loan mortgage, because the limited Federal and State funds available to the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands have been used to develop infrastructure rather than the construction of housing. An assignment of home lands property is in the form of a 99-year lease. Unless the heirs of the eligible Native Hawaiian qualify in their own right for an assignment of home lands under the provisions of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, upon the death of the eligible Native Hawaiian, the heirs must move off the land. 
   Currently, Native Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on the home lands but who do not qualify for private mortgage loans do not have access to federal housing assistance programs that provide assistance to low-income families. This is due to the fact that for many years, the federal government took the legal position that because the government that represented the Native Hawaiian people had been overthrown in 1893 and thus there was no government-to-government relationship with the United States, extending federal housing program assistance to lands set aside exclusively for Native Hawaiians would be discriminating on the basis of race or ethnicity. 
   The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act not only provides authority for the assignment of home lands property to Native Hawaiians. The Act also authorizes general leases to non-Hawaiians. At the time the Act was passed by the Congress, it was anticipated that revenues derived from general leases would be sufficient to develop the necessary infrastructure and housing on the home lands. However, general lease revenue has not proven sufficient to address infrastructure and housing needs. 
   In recent years, as a result of litigation involving third-party leases of Hawaiian home lands, the United States revisited its legal position and found that the authority contained in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act for general leases to non-Hawaiians meant that the land was not set aside exclusively for Native Hawaiians. The non-exclusive nature of the land set aside was thus found not to violate Constitutional prohibitions on racial discrimination. 
   The change in the United States' legal position may be further informed by the ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Rice v. Cayetano, No. 97-16095, 146 F.3d 1075 (9th Cir. 1998) in which the Appeals Court compared the special treatment of Native Hawaiians to the special treatment of Indians that the Supreme Court approved in Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535 (1974) and cited its reference to Mancari in Alaska Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors v. Pierce, 694 F.2d 1162 (9th Cir. 1981), in which the Circuit Court expressed its finding that preferential treatment that is grounded in the government's unique obligation toward Indians is a political rather than a racial classification, even though racial criteria may be used in defining eligibility. 
   However, the result of the United States' earlier legal position was that Native Hawaiians who were eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands and would have otherwise been eligible by virtue of their low-income status to apply for Federal housing assistance were foreclosed from participating in Federal housing assistance programs that were available to all other eligible families in the United States. 
   Mr. President, if enacted into law, the measure which I introduce today will finally provide some relief and support to those who are in the greatest need for a simple roof over their heads and a place to raise their families.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Clinical Social Workers' Recognition Act of 1999 to correct an outstanding problem in the Federal Employees Compensation Act. This bill will also provide clinical social workers the recognition they deserve as independent providers of quality mental health care services. 
   Clinical social workers are authorized to independently diagnose and treat mental illnesses through public and private health insurance plans across the Nation. However, Title V, United States Code, does not permit the use of mental health evaluations conducted by clinical social workers for use as evidence in determining workers' compensation claims brought by Federal employees. The bill I am introducing corrects this problem. 
   It is a sad irony that Federal employees may select a clinical social worker through their health plans to provide mental health services, but may not go to this professional for workers' compensation evaluations. The failure to recognize the validity of evaluations provided by clinical social workers unnecessarily limits Federal employees' selection of a provider to conduct the workers' compensation mental health evaluation and may well impose an undue burden on Federal employees where clinical social workers are the only available providers of mental health care.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to amend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to correct discrepancies in the reimbursement of clinical social workers covered through Medicare, Part B. The three proposed changes contained in this legislation clarify the current payment process for clinical social workers and establish a reimbursement methodology for the profession that is similar to other health care professionals reimbursed through the Medicare program. 
   First, this legislation sets payment for clinical social worker services according to a fee schedule established by the Secretary. Second, it explicitly states that services and supplies furnished by a clinical social worker are a covered Medicare expense, just as these services are covered for other mental health professionals in Medicare. Third, the bill allows clinical social workers to be reimbursed for services provided to a client who is hospitalized. 
   Clinical social workers are valued members of our health care provider team. They are legally regulated in every state of the nation and are recognized as independent providers of mental health care throughout the health care system. I believe it is time to correct the disparate reimbursement treatment of this profession under Medicare.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on behalf of our nation's clinical social workers, I am introducing legislation to amend the Public Health Service Act. This legislation would (1) establish a new social work training program; (2) ensure that social work students are eligible for support under the Health Careers Opportunity Program; (3) provide social work schools with eligibility for support under the Minority Centers of Excellence programs; (4) permit schools offering degrees in social work to obtain grants for training projects in geriatrics; and (5) ensure that social work is recognized as a profession under the Public Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Act. 
   Despite the impressive range of services social workers provide to people of this nation, particularly our elderly, disadvantaged and minority populations, few federal programs exist to provide opportunities for social work training in health and mental health care. This legislation builds on the health professional legislation enacted by the 102d Congress enabling schools of social work to apply for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) training funding and resources to establish collaborative relationships with rural health care providers and schools of osteopathic medicine. This bill would provide funding for traineeships and fellowships for individuals who plan to specialize in, practice, or teach social work, or for operating approved social work training programs; it would help disadvantaged students earn graduate degrees in social work with a concentration in health or mental health; it would provide new resources and opportunities in  social work training for minorities; and it would encourage schools of social work to expand program in geriatrics. Finally, the recognition of social work as a profession merely codifies current social work practice and reflects modifications made by the Medicare HMO legislation. 
   I believe it is important to ensure that the special expertise and skill social workers possess continue to be available to the citizens of this nation. This legislation, by providing financial assistance to schools of social work and social work students, recognizes the long history and critical importance of the services provided by social work professionals. In addition, since social workers have provided quality mental health services to our citizens for a long time and continue to be at the forefront of establishing innovative programs to service our disadvantaged populations, I believe it is time to provide them with the recognition they clearly earned and deserve.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation today to modify Title VII of the U.S. Public Health Service Act in order to provide students enrolled in graduate psychology programs with the opportunity to participate in various health professions loan programs 
   Providing students enrolled in graduate psychology programs with eligibility for financial assistance in the form of loans, loan guarantees, and scholarships will facilitate a much needed infusion of behavioral science expertise into our public health community of providers. There is a growing recognition of the valuable contribution that is being made by our nation's psychologists toward solving some of our nation's most distressing problems. 
   The participation of students from all backgrounds and clinical disciplines is vital to the success of health care training. The Title VII programs play a significant role in providing financial support for the recruitment of minorities, women and individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Minority therapists have an advantage in the provision of critical services to minority populations because often they can communicate with clients in their own language and cultural framework. Minority therapists are more likely to work in community settings, where ethnic minority and economically disadvantaged individuals are most likely to seek care. It is critical that continued support be provided for the training of individuals who provide health care services to underserved communities.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to amend Title VII of the Public Health Service Act to establish a psychology post-doctoral program. 
   Psychologists have made a unique contribution in serving the nation's medically underserved populations. Expertise in behavioral science is useful in addressing many of our most distressing concerns such as violence, addiction, mental illness, adolescent and child behavioral disorders, and family disruption. Establishment of a psychology post-doctoral program could be most effective in finding solutions to these pressing societal issues. 
   Similar programs supporting additional, specialized training in traditionally underserved settings or with underserved populations have been demonstrated to be successful in providing services to those same underserved during the years following the training experience. For example, mental health professional who have participated in these specialized federally funded programs have tended not only to meet their pay back obligations, but have continued to work in the public sector or with the underserved populations with whom they have been trained to work. 
   While the doctorate in psychology provides broad based knowledge and mastery in a wide variety of clinical skills, the specialized post-doctoral fellowship programs develop particular diagnostic and treatment skills required to effectively respond to these underserved populations. For example, what looks like severe depression in an elderly person might actually be withdrawal related to hearing loss, or what appears to be poor academic motivation in a child recently relocated from Southeast Asia might be reflective of a cultural value of reserve rather than a disinterest in academic learning. Each of these situations requires very different interventions, of course, and specialized assessment skills. 
   Domestic violence is not just a problem for the criminal justice system, it is a significant public health problem. A single aspect of this issue, domestic violence against women, results in almost 100,000 days of hospitalization, 30,000 emergency room visits and 40,000 visits to physicians each year. Rates of child and spouse abuse in rural areas are particularly high as are the rates of alcohol abuse and depression in adolescents. A post-doctoral fellowship program in psychology of the rural populations could be of special benefit in addressing the problems. 
   Given the changing demographics of the nation--the increasing life span and numbers of the elderly, the rising percentage of minority populations within the country, as well as an increased recognition of the long-term sequelae of violence and abuse--and given the demonstrated success and effectiveness of these kinds of specialized training programs, it is incumbent upon us to encourage participation in post-doctoral fellowships that respond to the needs of the nation's underserved.

Currently, the Chief Nurses of the three branches of the military are one-star general officer grades; this law would change the current grade to Major General in the Army and Air Force and Rear Admiral (upper half) in the Navy. 
   Our military Chief Nurses have an awesome responsibility--their scope of duties include peacetime and wartime health care doctrine, standards and policy for all nursing personnel within their respective branches. They are responsible for 80,000 Army, 5,200 Navy, and 20,000 Air Force officer and enlisted nursing personnel in the active, reserve and guard components of the military. This level of responsibility certainly supports the need to change the grade for the Chief Nurses which would ensure that they have an appropriate voice in Defense Health Program executive management. 
   Organizations are best served when the leadership is composed of a mix of specialties--of equal rank--who bring their unique talents to the policy setting and decision-making process. I believe it is time to ensure that military health care organizations utilize the expertise and unique contributions of the military Chief Nurses.

   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I introduce legislation today to amend Chapter 74 of Title 38, United States Code, to revise certain provisions relating to the appointment of clinical and professional psychologists in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). 
   The VHA has a long history of maintaining a staff of the very best health care professionals to provide care to those men and women who have served our country in the Armed Forces. 
   Recently, a quite distressing situation regarding the care of our veterans has come to my attention. In particular, the recruiting and retention of psychologists in the VHA of the Department of Veterans Affairs has become a significant problem. 
   The Congress has recognized the important contribution of the behavioral sciences in the treatment of several conditions afflicting a significant portion of our veterans. Programs related to homelessness, substance abuse, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have received funding from the Congress in recent years. 
   Certainly, psychologists, as behavioral science experts, are essential to the successful implementation of these programs. However, the high vacancy and turnover rates for psychologists in the VHA (more than 5% and 8% respectively as reported in one recent survey) might seriously jeopardize these programs and will negatively impact overall patient care in the VHA. 
   Recruitment of psychologists by the VHA is hindered by a number of factors including a pay scale not commensurate with private sector rates and the low number of clinical and professional psychologists appearing on the register of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Most new hires have no post-doctoral experience and are hired immediately after a VHA internship. Recruitment, when successful, takes up to six months or more. 
   Retention of psychologists in the VHA system poses an even more significant problem. I have been informed that almost 40% of VHA psychologists  have five years or less of post-doctoral experience. Psychologists leave the VHA system after five years because they have almost reached peak levels for salary and professional advancement. Furthermore, under the present system psychologists cannot be recognized nor appropriately compensated for excellence or for taking on additional responsibilities such as running treatment programs. 
   In effect, the current system for hiring psychologists in the VHA supports mediocrity, not excellence and mastery. Our veterans 
   with behavioral and mental health disorders are deserving of better psychological care from more experienced professionals than they are currently receiving. 
   Currently, psychologists are the only doctoral level health care providers in the VHA who are not included in Title 38. This is without question a significant factor in the recruitment and retention difficulties which I have addressed. Title 38 appointment authority for psychologists would help ameliorate the recruitment and retention problems. The length of time to recruit psychologists could be abbreviated by eliminating the requirement for applicants to be rated by the Office of Personnel Management. This would also encourage the recruitment of applicants who are not recent VHA interns by reducing the amount of time between identifying a desirable applicant and being able to offer that applicant a position. 
   It is expected that problems in retention will be greatly alleviated with the implementation of a Title 38 system that offers financial incentives for psychologists to pursue professional development. Achievements that would merit salary increases include such activities as assuming supervisory responsibilities for clinical programs, implementing innovative clinical treatments that improve the effectiveness and/or efficiency of patient care, making significant contributions to the science of psychology, earning the ABPP displomate state, and becoming a Fellow of the American Psychological Association. 
   The conversion of psychologists to Title 38, as proposed by this amendment, would provide relief for the retention and recruitment issues and enhance the quality of care for our Nation' veterans and their families.
