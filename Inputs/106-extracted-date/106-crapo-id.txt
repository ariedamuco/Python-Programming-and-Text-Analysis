   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in the final days of the 106th Congress, I wanted to take this opportunity to speak about the issue of debt relief and reform of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. 
   A great deal of attention has been paid recently to a complicated issue that has faced Congress--the international lending practices of the World Bank group and the IMF. The complexity increases when you factor in calls for the United States to contribute to efforts to write off debt owed by the world's heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs). 
   As vice chairman of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on International Trade and Finance, I have conducted a series of oversight hearings on the functioning of the IMF and World Bank. These hearings have only strengthened my belief that the evidence is clear--we should not grant  debt relief without demanding that the international lending institutions such as the World Bank and IMF change their current practices. 
   I supported Senate passage of the fiscal year 2001 foreign operations appropriations conference report with much reservation. 
   The bill collectively provides about $435 million toward debt forgiveness for the HIPCs. Of this money, $210 million comes disguised as ``emergency'' spending. 
   Regrettably, this all goes without any link between relief and reform. The legislation calls for a couple of reports to Congress and a few policy suggestions that the U.S. ought to urge these institutions to adopt, but it has no teeth to force change. The lending institutions pay no consequences for failing to mend their ways ..... this means the consequences of inaction will be borne by, among others, American taxpayers and people in need. 
   Essentially, the IMF, World Bank, and other international lending institutions are supposed to improve economies of impoverished countries and the health and well-being of people throughout the world. 
   In the U.S., we are a compassionate people; we share our bounty with many other countries. But many question the effectiveness of how the World Bank and the IMF perform their missions. 
   The World Bank and IMF lend money to certain countries to use for various purposes--improving infrastructure needs, feeding and immunizing children, and stabilizing the economy, to name a few. But these noble goals have been stymied by corruption, greed, and poor management. What has developed is sadly lacking in results and in much need of reform. 
   Some advocates of debt relief have tried to delink the issue of debt relief from the issue of reform. I agree with recent remarks that these lending institutions are at the ``root'' of the debt problem. And if we are to weed out the problem, we must pull it up by its roots. We all know that, if you don't pull up weeds by their roots, they merely sprout up again. This serves nobody's interest--least of all the people currently suffering. 
   We need transparency, accountability, and effectiveness. We need to know where the money is being spent, who is spending it, and how it is benefiting that country and achieving the goals of the World Bank and the IMF.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to commend the Idaho youth who have honored World War II veterans in recent months. Several Idaho high schools, including Pocatello High School, Highland High School, and Century High School, as well as Bosie high School, have become tremendously involved in Operation Recognition. In addition, students at Eagle High School have fundraised extensively for the National WWII Memorial that will be placed on the National Mall in Washington, DC. 
   Operation Recognition is a new program through which honorary high school diplomas are awarded to WWII veterans. The veterans who receive these diplomas left for service in the war before they completed their studies. The gesture of awarding an honorary diploma is a way to thank veterans and demonstrate appreciation for the sacrifices that they made. 
   Students whose high schools award honorary diplomas often assist in planning the details of the ceremony. In the process of developing memorable and personal additions to the graduation, these young people learn about the war and its historical significance. 
   Pocatello High School has selected December 7th of this year, which is the 59th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, as the date of its ceremony for graduating veterans. Honorary diplomas will also be awarded to those who attended nearby Highland High School and Century High School. As part of the festivities, one student from each high school will interview a veteran who attended his or her school. The graduates and their families are invited to stay after the ceremony for a reunion. Students have been asked to help decorate the stage and escort attendees to their seats. 
   The Boise High School History Club is already preparing for the April 17, 2001, Boise High veterans' graduation. Students in the club have done exhaustive research to find eligible veterans. They have also been working to publicize the event, preparing a yearbook for each graduating veteran, and making arrangements for a homeroom mentor program. The students are arranging speaking opportunities for the veterans and a range of social activities, including a cookout. Idaho State Veterans Home Volunteer Coordinator, Tom Ressler, says that the goal is to establish a relationship between veterans and students before the graduation. 
   Eagle High School students showed their appreciation for WWII veterans by raising more than twenty-three thousand dollars for the National WWII Memorial. Their year-and-a-half fundraising effort proved to be the most successful of all our nation's high schools. The enthusiastically-run fundraising campaign included candy sales, a giant tag sale, and concession stands. The students also marched in parades and ran advertisements on television. 
   Eleventh grade American history teacher, Gail Chumbley, and student chairs Fil Southerland and Kate Bowen spearheaded the initiative. Ms. Chumbley reported that the fundraising campaign has motivated many students to learn about WWII outside of class. Ms. Chumbley, Mr. Southerland, and Ms. Bowen will present The National Campaign Chairman, Senator Bob Dole, with a commemorative check at the monument's groundbraking ceremony that will be held on Veterans' Day this year. 
   I take great pride in the fact that members of the youngest generation of Idahoans, who have grown up in a time of relative peace and unprecedented prosperity for our country, take time to honor our nation's WWII veterans.  Through their endeavors, these students have learned much about WWII. In the process, they have heightened their community's awareness of this important part of American history and the brave people who were part of it.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Senate on its unanimous passage of the Violence Against Women Act. In particular, I would like to commend the members of the conference committee for including language that establishes a legal definition of dating violence. 
   In domestic violence situations, victims are victims regardless of their age or legal relationship to the abuser. The seriousness of this issue was brought home by a tragic case in Idaho. In December 1999, a 17-year-old Soda Springs, Idaho, girl, Cassie Dehl, was killed in an accident involving her abusive boyfriend. Prior to her death, the numerous attempts by her mother to obtain legal protection for her daughter failed because Idaho's domestic violence laws did not apply to teenage dating relationships. Earlier this year, Idaho Governor Dirk Kempthorne and the Idaho State Legislature enacted legislation, named in Cassie's memory, which extended Idaho domestic violence laws to dating relationships. I am pleased that Federal law will now also protect teenagers involved in abusive dating relationships.  
   While the reauthorization of VAWA is an important step in protecting all victims of domestic violence, our work is not yet done. Under VAWA, dating violence has been included in four of the five major domestic violence grant programs. However, one major grant program was left behind. I am committed to working with my colleagues in the next Congress to expand dating violence to all domestic violence programs under VAWA.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I thank Senator BOND and Senator MIKULSKI. As chairman of the Fisheries, Wildlife and Drinking Water Subcommittee, I rise today in strong opposition to the amendment to prevent the EPA from having the time necessary to produce a proper arsenic drinking water rule based on the available science. It is important to note that in 1996 this Congress directed the EPA to adopt a specific schedule to propose an arsenic standard to allow for a full year of public review and comments by scientific experts and then to implement a rule after taking into consideration those comments. 
   That is what is at stake. It is important to follow up on what Senators BOND and MIKULSKI have said about what this amendment really does. It has been characterized as stopping the EPA from protecting us from arsenic problems. 
   The reality is that all this amendment does is give the EPA up to an additional 6 months to complete its work. In fact, I am quite surprised to see this amendment today because the administration itself has said they do not have the ability to meet the statutory deadline, and they need this extra time to make sure the rule they adopt is scientifically justified and does not cause the immense damage to local small communities in rural areas that is of concern. 
   We have held hearings on this issue in our subcommittee, and witness after witness has raised questions about whether the science is there to justify the direction in which the EPA is going. The EPA has acknowledged these questions. The EPA has said it needs time to further review the science, and the EPA has said it will take that time if we give it to them to do a good rule that will protect the country and yet not do damage to small communities in rural areas. 
   It is also important to note that this amendment does not stop the EPA from acting at any time the EPA deems it is ready to act. If the EPA says it has the process finalized, it has the science understood and is ready to proceed, they can proceed tomorrow, they can proceed in November or December or January when the statutory deadline exists. Again, the EPA has told us they are not ready to do so and that they need this extra time. We believe they need the extra time because of the impending damage that could be caused to local communities across this country. 
   As Senator BOND has said, there are communities and individual families who will see their water bills go up by hundreds of dollars. There are communities that probably will have to go off their systems because of this. The potential damage if we do not give the EPA the time to act properly and to review the comments is immense, and that is why I must oppose this amendment. I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. CRAPO.

   Mr. CRAPO. Concerns have been raised that Pittman-Robertson lands should not be used for field trials. As the Senator from New Hampshire knows, the sportsmen who pay this excise tax have varied interests--they are hunters, field trialers, and shooting enthusiasts. The primary goal of the Pittman-Robertson Act is wildlife conservation, but it is also important that these lands support multiple uses.

   Mr. CRAPO. Multiple uses of public lands necessarily require the balancing of occasionally competing interests and objectives. The most appropriate parties to make decisions regarding wildlife habitat development and other uses and activities are state wildlife managers who are most familiar with site specific conditions, habitat needs, and the impact of sporting activities.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 3671, the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000. The bill we have before us today is the culmination of a bi-partisan, bi-cameral effort. I want to thank Chairman BOB SMITH, Ranking Member BAUCUS, and Senator BOXER for their hard work and recognition of how important it was to pass this bill this year. I also thank Representative DON YOUNG, Chairman of the House Resources Committee, for his efforts and investigation into the program. 
   I think we have a bill that everyone can support. It will reduce Government waste and prevent misuse of funds, while enhancing the program. The federal aid program has been a conservation success story. This bill will ensure that this success continues by restoring accountability and responsibility to the program. Ultimately, this legislation will restore trust in the program, without affecting the effectiveness of the program. 
   Senator CRAIG and I introduced the Senate version of this bill because there was a problem and America's hunters and fishermen needed trust returned to the administration of the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs. The bill we have before us today restricts the amount of money that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can spend on administrative expenses, while clearly identifying authorized expenses. The bill also improves the program by funding a multi-state grant program, and ensuring that hunter education and shooting range programs are funded at the level hunters and shooting enthusiasts expect and deserve. These changes are good for the program, good for hunters, fishermen, and shooting enthusiasts, and are simply good government. 
   Congressional investigations and a General Accounting Office audit of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service revealed that, contrary to existing law, money had been routinely diverted to administrative slush funds, withheld from states, and generally misused for purposes unrelated to either fisheries or wildlife conservation. In addition, the GAO called the Division of Federal Aid, ``if not the worst, one of the worst-managed programs we have encountered.'' As an avid outsdoorsman, I was particularly disturbed by this abuse. As a legislator, I am pleased to have an opportunity to prevent such abuses in the future. 
   This bill reestablishes the trust between the hunters and anglers who pay the excise taxes and the Federal Government. It is an opportunity to repair a system that has been lauded as one of the nation's most successful conservation efforts. I hope my colleagues will join me in passing this bipartisan effort to restore accountability and responsibility to the Federal Aid programs and the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   I thank the Chair.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the remarkable accomplishments of Charles Burton, an Idaho native and wrestler for the U.S. Olympic team. 
   Charles was born in Ontario, Oregon and raised in Boise, Idaho. He graduated from Centennial High School in Boise, where he was a state champion, and Boise State University, where he won All-American status. In 1997, Charles won the University Freestyle National Championship and became a Pan American bronze medalist. Charles earned the number two spot on the US National team in 1999 after earning a silver medal at the world team trials in Seattle, Washington. He will wrestle in the Olympics from September 29th through October 1st. 
   This Idahoan, and other devoted athletes, serve as reminders that through healthy competition, our challengers can inspire us to excel. They unify those of us who watch them through shared pride and passion. Their victories leave our souls soaring high and our feet light. In times of defeat, we are humbled by the fact that there is more work to be done to reach our team's victory. 
   The Olympic ideal is perhaps the best evidence that endurance, the desire to challenge oneself, and the pursuit of achieving top physical form are age-old endeavors. The events demonstrate  that the will to compete in the athletic arena is nearly universal, crossing boundaries of culture and geography to bring together most of the world's nations. It is one of the great celebrations of the human spirit and one of the finest examples of our time of peaceful multi-national competition. 
   I am very proud of Charles' accomplishments and the role that he will play in this international competition. I wish Charles, and all the other athletes who are participating in the Olympics this year, the challenge of vigorous competition. May they again know the exaltation of pushing themselves to their limits and the roar of a crowd that lives vicariously through their triumph.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution that expresses Congress' views on the importance of bringing transparency, accountability, and effectiveness to the World Bank. A necessary step towards achieving these worthwhile objectives is getting the World Bank to carefully and properly examine current programs and projects. The resolution I am introducing today calls for the World Bank to commit to independent performance audits and evaluations of its programs and projects. It outlines some of the steps the World Bank must take to begin a much-needed overhaul. 
   I share the objectives of the World Bank in reducing poverty in developing countries and bolstering their economies. The World Bank seeks a ``World Free of Poverty,'' and we can all recognize this as a good aim. We live in a global society and all have a role in improving the health and well-being of people living in all parts of the world. 
   With this said, I fear that the U.S. is sending its taxpayers' hard-earned dollars to the World Bank with little to show for it. Collectively, U.S. taxpayers represent the single largest contributor of financial resources to the World Bank. Recent reports by the General Accounting Office, the congressionally-mandated and bipartisan International Financial Institution Advisory Commission as well as the testimony of experts testifying before a hearing I held this summer in the Senate Banking Subcommittee on International Trade and Finance, all agree on one thing--we can't even tell with a reasonable level of certainty that funds the World Bank spends on its programs and projects are spent efficiently and as intended to be spent. 
   Additionally, right now Congress is being asked to pony up money for bilateral debt relief to the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and as a contribution to the HIPC Initiative for mulilateral debt relief to these poor countries. This allows the multilateral financial institutions to forgive debts and make debt service payments that they are owed by the HIPCs. In part, HIPC Trust Fund monies are used to reimburse the World Bank for debt relief it provides to the HIPCs. We don't want to be sending good money after bad. We don't want to support failed lending and program practices of any international institutions because that would be money wasted. If Congress is to continue supporting the HIPC Initiative, we need to send a message that we want change. 
   This is why it is essential that Congress take a stand for our taxpayers who contribute so much money and a stand for the people around the globe who the Bank's programs and projects are designed to benefit. 
   Adopting this resolution makes this statement. It asks the World Bank to carefully examine its current activities and the way it conducts business. The resolution calls for the World Bank to publicly commit to having an independent third party with no vested interest in the outcome, conduct a thorough review of the Bank's programs and projects through performance audits and a complete performance evaluation that is made public. 
   A complete and open examination of the Bank's practices, its successes and failures, is a win-win for everyone. It's a win for the Bank who will know whether its programs are best targeted to achieve its mission of `A World Free of Poverty,'' a win for member countries who will know whether their monies are being spent as intended, and most importantly, a win for people worldwide whose health and well-being the Bank strives to improve. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this measure.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge the efforts of the tens of thousands of brave men and women who have fought this year's rash of wildfires throughout the West. These firefighters have weakened the menacing flames that have burned millions of acres of western states, taking lives and devouring farmland, forests and homes. More than six and a half million acres have been destroyed this year. My home state of Idaho, with one and a quarter million acres lost to the flames, has been one of the most harmed. 
   This fire season is the worst we have faced in fifty years. It is clear that without the help of the many people who are fighting these fires, many inhabited areas of the West could become smoldering expanses of charred remains. I offer my sincerest gratitude to everyone participating in the effort to combat the devastating fires. Their work protecting lives, property and the environment is appreciated by all westerners and is crucial to the western economy. 
   Firefighters and fire support teams have been deployed from a range of federal and municipal agencies including county sheriffs departments, local volunteer fire departments, tribes and other local crews throughout the West and the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Help has also been enlisted from the National Guard and battalions from the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps as well as from trained individuals from Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. Most of these efforts have been coordinated out of the National Interagency Fire Center, located in Boise, Idaho. 
   Battling fires is dangerous and exhausting work. The air is warm, smoke-filled and flecked with ash. Most of the firefighter's time is spent building firelines, burning out areas, moping up after fires and directly attacking fires. These tasks often entail miles of walking, and hours of tough manual labor, like scraping the ground, chopping and digging, all while wearing uncomfortable protective equipment. 
   The work is so demanding that some firefighters still lose weight even though they have consumed five or six thousand calories a day. Sleep is often inadequate and infrequent. Some teams along the fire line have been known to work 48-hour shifts before calling it a day. Firefighters can almost count on receiving blistered feet and bloodshot eyes. Serious injuries and even death are ever-present risks. This year, sixteen people have suffered fire-related fatalities. 
   Fire support teams also have been working overtime as drivers, equipment operators, paramedics, medical staff, and trouble shooters. It is an enormous management task just to make sure that all of the firefighters are fed and that they receive the equipment, medical attention, and time to sleep. 
   I commend all of the firefighters and support teams for meeting the physical and mental challenges with bravery and steadfast determination. I know I speak for all when I say that our thoughts and prayers are for their safety and we are eager for them to return to their normal lives. 
   The fire season is not yet over as hundreds of fires blaze and threats of more lightening storms that could bring new fires loom. This is indeed a difficult time, although we can take peace of mind from the fact that steady, well-trained hands are working on our behalf to keep the towering flames at bay. Right now, it is important to be grateful for the hard work that has been done to protect us and hopeful for an end to the destruction.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the remarkable accomplishments of Ruthie Matthes, an Idaho native and a cross-country cyclist, and Stacy Dragila, an Idaho constituent and pole vaulter. 
   At the United States Olympic Track and Field trials in July, Stacy cleared fifteen feet, two and a quarter inches, which broke her personal record by a half-inch and further solidified her qualification to represent the United States at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. 
   Stacy, a native of Auburn, California, graduated from Idaho State University and currently resides in Pocatello in my home state of Idaho. It is an honor that she has chosen to live in Idaho and continues to do a lot of her training in Idaho. 
   Stacy has won three of four national championships since the pole vault became an official event in 1997. She currently ranks as the defending world champion and has broken her indoor and outdoor world records a combined eight times since August. All of her competitions have been approached with maximum effort and dedicated preparation. 
   At the U.S. Track and Field Trials, Stacy tried to break her record again, attempting fifteen feet, five inches, three times. She missed each of her three tries, but ended the competition encouraged and gratified nonetheless. ``It helps me to know that I can jump under pressure,'' she said. ``And it's nice to know that I'm attempting 15-5 and I still have things to work on.'' 
   Ruthie Matthes was born in Sun Valley, ID, and lived in neighboring Ketchum throughout most of her formative years. She began cycling as part of her training for alpine hill ski racing. Her decision to cycle full-time was followed by great success. 
   Between 1990 and 1996, Ruthie took home two bronze, two silver, and one gold medal at the World Mountain Bike Championships. She was also the National Cross-Country champion from 1996-1998. Her off-road career now includes three consecutive national cross-country titles. 
   Ruthie deserves as much praise for her athletic prowess as she does for her positive sports ethic. ``You have to stay true to your heart,'' says Matthes. ``Do your very best and enjoy it. Whether you finish first, tenth or last, all of it is an opportunity to learn about yourself.'' 
   These two women, and other devoted athletes, serve as reminders that,  through healthy competition, our challengers can inspire us to excel. They unify those of us who watch them through shared pride and passion. Their victories leave our souls soaring high and our feet feeling light. In times of defeat, we are humbled by the fact that there is more work to be done to reach our team's victory.

It is one of the great celebrations of the human spirit and one of the finest examples of our time of peaceful multi-national competition. 
   I am very proud of Ruthie and Stacy's accomplishments and the role that they will play in this international competition. I wish Ruthie, Stacy, and all the other athletes who are participating in the Olympics this year, the challenge of vigorous competition.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my esteemed colleague, Paul Coverdell. I join with my colleagues in expressing sadness at his passing. He was a tremendous leader in the Senate and an asset for Georgians and the rest of the country. His years of exemplary public service have included the military, the Peace Corps, the Georgia statehouse, and finally the U.S. Senate. Senator Coverdell was an effective leader and demonstrated many times his unifying influence in the Senate. 
   On a personal level, he was an unpretentious man who had a quiet sense of humor and good mind for details. He was instrumental in helping me make the transition from the U.S. House to the Senate a couple of years ago, and provided insight and advice in everything from how to set up a Senate office to how to make time for my family. There is not a day that goes by that his influence in my Senate career has not been felt. 
   Paul was a friend and a model statesman. He spent a lifetime of service to his country. I will miss him dearly. I extend my prayers to his wife, Nancy, and the rest of his family.

   Mr. CRAPO. I want to express my appreciation for the Senator's efforts, and those of the Committee Chairman, Senator SMITH, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Senator GRAHAM in working with Senator BAUCUS and me to reaffirm the eligibility of Private Non-Profit (PNP) irrigation companies for FEMA reimbursement of their facilities in the aftermath of disasters. As he knows, a pending FEMA policy would unfairly single out irrigators among PNPs as ineligible for FEMA assistance. Language in the legislation would ensure that PNP irrigators receive the same treatment as other PNPs in the event of a disaster. 
   This matter is of critical importance to PNP irrigation companies throughout the West. Generally taking on the responsibilities of water utilities elsewhere, irrigation companies provide a  valuable service to westerners, including the provision of drinking water, irrigation support, and other critical facilities. Without these services, life in the West could not exist as we know it today. 
   At this time, I would ask that we yield to the distinguished Ranking Member of the full Committee, Senator BAUCUS. Senator BAUCUS?

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to an amendment that would make drastic cuts to the timber program. 
   While we have heard a lot of rhetoric regarding the timber program, it is important to understand the context within which these cuts to the timber sale and road construction programs are being considered. Federal timber sales are in a steep and devastating decline. Forest health is increasingly at risk from fire, insects and disease. 
   Both the economic and ecological contexts created by this reduction are undesirable. 
   More than 80,000 jobs have been lost and a 1999 General Accounting Office study reported that over forty million acres of National Forest system lands are at risk of catastrophic wildfire. Another twenty-six million acres are at risk from insects and disease. The recent fires in New Mexico and in other states provide alarming evidence of the impact of increased fuel loads in our forests. Already this year, more than four-and-a-half million acres have burned. Active management is vital to forest health, and it is irresponsible for the federal government to reduce the management options available to local forest managers who best know how to deal with their specific situations. 
   It is confounding that additional cuts in the federal timber sale program are being considered at a time when the industry and those working men and women who depend on it has already been crippled by deep cuts and our forests are suffering from lack of active management that includes responsible timber harvest. Since the early 1990s, the timber program has been reduced by 70 percent and more than 75 percent of the National Forest system is off-limits to timber harvest. The federal timber supply has dropped from twelve billion board-feet harvested to three billion board-feet harvested annually. This amendment would jeopardize 55,000 jobs and $2 billion in employment income, mostly in rural areas. In addition, national forests have 50 percent of our nation's softwood growing stock, which is used for home construction. New reductions in the availability of this supply will hurt housing prices. 
   In my home State of Idaho, small, rural communities continue to suffer devastating reductions in Forest Service Payments-to-states funds from timber sales. In rural Idaho and America, schools are going without needed renovation, county governments are struggling, and basic services are already being jeopardized by steep reductions in federal timber harvest in recent years. This amendment would further reduce payments to rural counties by $7 million and returns to the treasury by $30 million. 
   While some will claim that recreation receipts can replace timber receipts, this simply is not true in Idaho. Eight counties in Idaho derive more than 20 percent of their employment activity from the primary timber industry. There are only two counties in Idaho that have more than a 5 percent dependence on the recreation industry. 
   This amendment is also counterintuitive from an environmental perspective. Active forest management, including thinning and other timber harvest, has widely acknowledge benefits. In fact, most timber sales are currently designed to attain other stewardship objectives. Interestingly enough, it is the sales that have been planned to focus on stewardship objectives that have been criticized as below cost. Timber sales are the most economical, efficient, and effective  method available to local resource managers to treat and control many insect epidemics. These harvests contribute greatly to reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire and promoting diverse stands. 
   Each year, the National Forest system grows 23 billion board-feet. Six billion board-feet die naturally. Only 3 billion board-feet are harvested annually. Tree growth in the National Forest system exceeds harvest by 600 percent. There is no need, environmental or otherwise, to further cripple this important program. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and for the health of rural economies and the forests within the National Forest system.

   Mr. CRAPO. First, allow me to commend the Chairman for his leadership and hard work on this bill. He and the Subcommittee have had to make difficult decisions with scarce resources and have worked hard to do so in a fair manner. I appreciate the Chairman's efforts and diligence. 
   Idaho is a state of spectacular natural beauty and wildlife habitat. As the Chairman knows, an opportunity exists to use Land and Water Conservation Funds (LWCF) to acquire easements in the state to protect these valuable habitats and scenic values. 
   While I am concerned regarding the level of funding appropriated, I appreciate the Subcommittee's recognition of the importance of funding easements in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, near the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area, and on the Lower Salmon River. However, many other LWCF projects in the state were not funded. Protecting deer habitat in the Soda Springs Hills, acquiring inholdings to protect elk range and address historic mining activities in the Silver Spar Land Acquisition, securing easements along the Upper Snake River and South Fork of the Snake River, and acquiring private land, the  Sulfur Creek Ranch, within the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness area are all important projects. These projects are all locally-driven, with wide-spread support, and anxious willing-sellers. 
   I recognize that the Subcommittee is operating under significant financial restraints and that, unfortunately, not all worthy projects can be funded. It is my hope that if additional LWCF money becomes available, the Chairman can revisit these important Idaho projects. I would ask the Chairman if he would work with us in conference to evaluate these requests, with an eye toward inclusion in the conference report.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for this pro-family, pro-economic growth legislation. It is unfortunate that government continues to burden its citizens with excessive and unfair taxation. Indeed, America's income tax system reduces freedom and economic growth. An embarrassing example of this inequity is the marriage penalty--essentially, a quirk in the income tax code that causes some married couples to be penalized and taxed at higher rates, simply because they marry. 
   The treatment of marriage provides an important example of why we need to support equity in the tax code. Consider that two couples who are exactly the same--except one is married and the other couple is not. A peculiar feature in our tax code is that these two couples may pay different taxes. Simply put, when a man and woman get married, their tax liability can rise and the federal government can take more of the married couple's money. This is a fundamental problem in the tax code. I believe in fairness and simplicity when it comes to taxes. A married couple should not pay more taxes than an unmarried couple with the same total income. This is poor policy. 
   Marriage neutrality is the principle that when two people get married, their total bill should not change. Unfortunately, the U.S. income tax is not marriage neutral. According to the Congressional Budget Office, almost half of all married couples--22 million--suffered from the marriage penalty last year. In my home state of Idaho, 129,710 couples were adversely affected because of this system. These married couples on average paid an extra $1,500 in income tax. Moreover, as women are working hard to achieve salary equity, it is unfortunate that as women approach income levels similar to their husbands, the marriage penalty increasingly kicks in and the federal government simply takes their money back. 
   Under this bill, beginning next year, Congress will restore marriage neutrality to the code. The Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Reconciliation Act will increase the standard deduction for married couples to approximately $8,800. This is twice the basic standard deduction for a single tax filer. The bill will also widen the 15 percent and 28 percent income tax brackets for married couples filing a joint return to twice the size of the corresponding rate brackets of single individuals. This is a commonsense solution to ending any disparity for married couples who find they are paying a penalty. Fortunately for them, the rules under which we are debating the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Reconciliation Act will also shield senators from excess delay and we will have an up-or-down vote. True to the bill's name, we are here to reconcile an unfair tax provision that is counterproductive to our goal of equity and fairness. 
   Today, we have finally put an end to expensive entitlements and the reckless fiscal behavior that created large deficits in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. Indeed, the surging U.S. economy has produced an unprecedented tidal wave of federal tax receipts. This year, the country will see a $76 billion dollar surplus--over the next ten years the non-social security surplus is estimated at $1.9 trillion. This raises the question: when will the government start returning money to the people? With these surpluses there is no doubt that there is room for marriage tax relief and additional debt reduction. Therefore, we should seize this opportunity to return these surplus dollars, before the bureaucrats in town start spending them. If we do not, an opportunity to restore horizontal equity to the tax code will be lost, because surpluses--like we have today--will certainly invite an irresponsible flurry of new spending. 
   Americans have historically and consistently expressed their discontent for excessive and unfair taxation. I have stacks of letters in my office from honest and hard-working Idahoans who rightfully want to know where their  tax cut is. Let us take this opportunity to return something to those American families who are married and working to support families and loved ones. Let us make good on our constituent promise by voting to eliminate the marriage tax penalty and let us give the President an opportunity to honor his State of the Union promise by signing this bill. 
   The federal tax code remains intrusive, overly complicated, and excessively burdensome. As part of my effort to bring tax relief to the American people, I have co-sponsored or voted for legislation to reduce the death tax, gas tax, beer tax, and telephone excise tax. Today, we have an opportunity to vote for a bill that I hope will have broad bipartisan support. Senators should be mindful of the opportunity to provide needed relief to married couples. Death and taxes are certainties in life. Let us vote to ensure that fairness is too. I urge my colleagues to support repeal of the marriage tax penalty. It is the right thing to do.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint resolution, co-sponsored by Senators BOB SMITH, HUTCHINSON, CRAIG, SHELBY, COVERDELL, ENZI, GRAMM, and INHOFE, revoking the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) rule on Total Maximum Daily Loads under the Clean Water Act. 
   I strongly support the EPA's goal of cleaning up our nation's water bodies but disagree with its approach. We must accelerate cleanup of our rivers, lakes, and streams; unfortunately, the EPA's rule will not accomplish that goal. In fact, the EPA's hastily completed rule will divert billions of dollars from programs that are working to an unreasonable, prohibitively-expensive, and technically-unworkable program. 
   Since the EPA's draft TMDL rule was first published in August 1999, many stakeholders including states, industry, environmental organizations, the public, and Congress have all raised serious concerns. The EPA received over 34,000 public comments, most overwhelmingly in opposition to the rule. Twenty public forums were conducted; again, sentiments ran overwhelmingly in opposition to the EPA's rule. Twelve congressional hearings were held, revealing that the proposal is unreasonable and unworkable. The National Governors' Association denounced the rule as an inflexible, unfunded mandate that will eliminate opportunities to reduce overall pollution. In a May 19 letter, six environmental groups urged the EPA to ``withdraw the current version of the proposed rule, which is so fundamentally flawed that it would weaken the existing TMDL program.'' 
   When it became clear that the EPA was ignoring concerns and proceeding to fast-track its rule, even in the fact of such serious opposition, Congress, rightly, exercised its oversight responsibility by including specific language in the Fiscal Year 2001 Military Construction Supplemental Appropriations bill to prevent finalization of the rule. Similar language was also passed by the House in the FY 2001 VA-HUM-Independent Agencies Appropriations bill. In clear defiance of Congress, the EPA promulgated the rule on July 11, 2000. 
   The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801-808 provides for expedited congressional review of agency rulemaking; specially, Section 802 provides a legislative procedure by which Congress can disapprove an agency's rule. This congressional review statute was approved in the 104th Congress for situations just such as this to reserve to Congress a mechanism for exercising its agency oversight responsibility. 
   It is important that we work to develop a program that will enhance, not hinder, our cleanup efforts. Repeatedly, the EPA was urged to repropose a rule that will accomplish our goal of more clean water more quickly; revoking the hurriedly completed rule will allow the EPA to focus its efforts on a program that will actually achieve the goals of the Clean Water Act. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the EPA's efforts to circumvent Congress and encouraging it to develop an effective proposal in collaboration with the public.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2001 Defense Authorization Act to authorize the conceptual design of a Subsurface Geoscience Laboratory at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. As many of my colleagues know, money for environmental cleanup is in short supply. The options for addressing cleanup funding shortfalls are limited to taking funds from other programs to support environmental cleanup, not doing the cleanup, or putting money into research, development, science, and technology to make environmental cleanup cheaper and more efficient. This amendment and the Subsurface Geoscience Laboratory addresses the latter of these options. 
   The Subsurface Geoscience Laboratory would be located at the INEEL which, as the load laboratory for the Environmental Management program within DOE, is the natural location for this facility. In addition, the capabilities and core competencies of the INEEL are a good fit with the subsurface science needs of the nation. I say the nation because, although this facility would be located in Idaho, the solution developed would be applicable to DOE sites across the nation. The solutions developed would also be applicable outside of the DOE, in fact, anywhere environmental contaminants threaten subsurface water supplies. The $400,000 authorized by this amendment for conceptual design of the Subsurface Geoscience Laboratory is an important first step to developing the scientific and technical tools needed to solve environmental cleanup problems. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to commend two Idaho schools, Garfield Elementary School in Boise and Sunnyside Elementary School in Kellogg for their high standards and excellent teaching records. 
   Last month, these two schools were recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the National Association of Title I Directors as Distinguished Title I Schools. These two elementary schools were among the ninety schools nationwide to be recognized for their efforts toward student achievement in schools that teach students from low-income households. Garfield Elementary and Sunnyside Elementary exemplify Idaho's high education standards and I am honored to congratulate these two schools for receiving this national award. 
   This national honor is especially impressive when one recognizes that more than fifty thousand schools across the country use Title I funds to boost the achievement levels of students from low-income households. The distinction of 2000 Distinguished Title I School is awarded to schools whose programs offer children from educationally disadvantaged communities access to effective academic lessons. Education is crucial to the well-being of these future adults because it is often their means of upward mobility. Improved education opportunities allows these children to become better citizens and achieve their education and career goals, including higher paying jobs, and a better quality of life. 
   Much of Sunnyside Elementary's success can be attributed to an active parent volunteer program. For example, while the school has only 300 students, approximately 124 parents volunteer their time at least once a year and forty-nine parents volunteer at the school on a regular basis. A web page, maintained by Principal Steve Shepperd and monthly school newsletters inform parents of school activities and highlight ways parents can get involved. The suggested tasks are often as simple as helping children with homework assignments. 
   Principal Shepperd says, ``Just because sixty percent of the students we teach come from households that are at or near the poverty level, it doesn't mean that they cannot learn. We concentrate on setting high standards and we help the kids meet them by offering encouragement and extra assistance with their lessons.'' Principal Shepperd credits the dedicated teachers of Sunnyside Elementary for putting in extra time and for bringing so much of their energy into the classroom. 
   Garfield Elementary is noted for its tremendous community involvement. Student volunteers from Boise State University, most of them studying to be teachers, regularly tutor students after school. Garfield hosts an annual Career Day in which professionals from the community describe their careers and how they pursued them. The school also has a fifteen-member mentor program. Although none of the tutors have children of their own who attend Garfield, they come to the school frequently during lunchtime to read with children. This extensive community involvement is one of the reasons why the Iowa Test of Basic Skills for students at Garfield Elementary have risen as much as thirty points on a 100-point scale for some grades. 
   In addition to volunteering, parents at Garfield Elementary are encouraged by Principal Elaine Eichelberg to join one of the school's many committees. At the beginning of the year, each household receives a questionnaire that lists specific ways to help and asks parents to indicate their interest and availability. Principal Eichelberg says, ``One of the best things parents can do to improve their child's education is to keep close tabs on their child's progress themselves and work with teachers when problems at school arise.'' 
   The national recognition that Sunnyside Elementary and Garfield Elementary have received reaffirms my belief that Idaho has some of the best teachers and administrators in the nation. Backed by strong involvement from parents and encouragement from the community, these elementary schools have demonstrated success in teacher training, utilized community resources, and established partnerships with parents. 
   There has been much debate about the success of the Title I program in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Schools like Garfield and Sunnyside show us that the programs implemented with the use of Title I funds do work. When we invest in quality education programs that focus on basic skills, such as reading and mathematics, our low-performing students will improve. The methods employed in Idaho serve as a reminder that community and parental support often make the biggest difference in elementary education. 
   I am very proud of the accomplishments of these two schools. Their steady focus on hard work has put their students on a path of continued academic success.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my colleagues, Senator CRAIG and Senator BURNS, to introduce the Backcountry Landing Strip Access Act. This bill will preserve our nation's backcountry airstrips and require a public review and comment period before airstrips are temporarily or permanently closed. 
   Idaho is home to more than fifty backcountry airstrips and the state is known nationwide for its air access to wilderness and primitive areas. In testimony before Congress on the importance of preserving backcountry airstrips, Bart Welsh, Aeronautics Administrator for the Idaho Department of Transportation, stated that these airstrips are, ``an irreplaceable state and national treasure.'' Unfortunately, the reality today is that many airstrips have been closed or rendered unserviceable through neglect by federal agencies responsible for land management. Even more troubling is that these closures occur without providing the public with a justification for such action or an opportunity to comment on them. 
   Our bill would address this situation by preventing the Secretary of Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture from permanently closing airstrips without first consulting with state aviation agencies and users. The legislation would also require that proposed closures would be published in the Federal Register with a ninety-day public comment period. The bill directs the Secretary of Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, after consultation with the FAA, to adopt a nationwide policy governing backcountry aviation. Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention that this bill is a result of Congressman JIM HANSEN's tireless efforts in promoting backcountry aviation access in the other body. 
   Backcountry airstrips are disappearing and, because of existing statutes, they are irreplaceable. When the Frank Church Wilderness Act was established in Idaho, it incorporated a provision to provide for the continued operation of all existing landing strips. The Act states that existing landing strips cannot be closed permanently or rendered unserviceable without the written consent of the State of Idaho. This has created an effective partnership between personnel from the U.S. Forest Service and staff from the Idaho Division of Aeronautics along with other interested parties. My bill extends the success of the Frank Church Wilderness Act provision nationwide to preserve airstrips in Idaho as well as other states. 
   I have heard from general aviation users and state aviation officials that pilots often discover that an airstrip is closed only when they attempt to use it. This represents a grave danger to those who have not been made aware of an airstrip's closure. The public process in this bill would rectify this problem by ensuring that everyone with an interest in backcountry aviation remains informed of a proposed closure and is allowed to comment on it. 
   Backcountry airstrips are active and essential to citizens who depend on wilderness access. These airstrips are utilized by pilots and outdoor enthusiasts. In addition, access to the strips ensures a fundamental American service--universal postal delivery. Without access to backcountry airstrips, citizens who live and work in remote areas would not receive their mails.  
   Among the other vital functions of backcountry airstrips is their use for firefighting, search and rescue, and especially their availability to pilots in emergencies. Backcountry airstrips are analogous to fire engines in a firehouse. Although the airstrip may not used daily, it is always available in an emergency. Likewise, backcountry airstrips are available as a safe haven for public flying in remote mountainous areas. Without the airstrips, these pilots would have little chance of survival while attempting an emergency landing. 
   Let me be clear, the Backcountry Landing Strip Access Act does not harm our forests or our wilderness areas, as some might suggest. Moreover, backcountry airstrips are regularly used by forest officials to maintain forests and trails, conduct ecological management projects, and aerial mapping. This bill is simply about access. It does not reopen airstrips that have already been closed, nor does it burden federal officials with maintenance requirements. In fact, pilots themselves regularly maintain backcountry strips. 
   The Backcounty Landing Strip Access Act is commonsense legislation that allows those who used and benefit from the airstrips to be involved in the decision-making process. I have always found that decisions on the use of public land are best handled by those who are impacted the most, rather than federal bureaucrats in Washington, DC. In Idaho, we have evolved into a cooperative relationship with federal land managers. It makes sense that the rest of the country should benefit from this philosophy of cooperation. One we lose an airstrip it is gone forever. I urge my colleagues to join with us in an effort to preserve the remaining backcountry airstrips.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Wildlife and  Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000 with my colleague, Senator LARRY CRAIG, to bring accountability back to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's administration of the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act and the Dingell-Johnson Sportfish Restoration Act. For years, the Fish and Wildlife Service has apparently misused millions of dollars from these accounts, betraying the trust of America's sportsman. 
   Congressional investigations and a General Accounting Office audit of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have revealed that, contrary to existing law, money has been routinely diverted to administrative slush funds, withheld from states, and generally misused for purposes unrelated to either sportfishing or wildlife conservation. In addition, the GAO called the Division of Federal Aid, ``if not the worst, one of the worst-managed programs we have encountered.'' As an avid outdoorsman, I am particularly disturbed by this abuse. 
   Since 1937, sportsman have willingly paid an excise tax on hunting, and later fishing, equipment. These hunters, shooters, and anglers paid this tax with the understanding that the money would be used for state fish and wildlife conservation programs. This partnership has been instrumental in providing generations of Americans a quality recreational experience. Through the years, it has been an experience that I have enjoyed with both my parents and my children. 
   The Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Program, commonly known as the Pittman-Robertson Act, provides funding for wildlife habitat restoration and improvement, wildlife management research, hunter education, and public target ranges. Funds for the Pittman-Robertson Act are derived from an 11 percent excise tax on sporting arms, ammunition, and archery equipment, and a 10 percent tax on handguns. 
   The Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Program, often referred to as the Dingell-Johnson and Wallop-Breaux Acts, is funded through a 10 percent excise tax on fishing equipment and a 3 percent tax on electric trolling motors, sonor fish finders, taxes on motorboat fuels, and import duties on fishing and pleasure boats. Through the cost reimbursement program, states use these funds to enhance sport fishing. These enhancements come through fish stocking, acquisition and improvement of habitat educational programs, and development of recreational facilities that directly support sport fishing, such as boat ramps and fishing piers. 
   Under the law, revenue from these taxes are expected to be returned to state and local fish and game organizations for programs to manage and enhance sport fish and game species. The Fish and Wildlife Service is supposed to deduct only the cost of administering the programs, up to 8 percent of Pittman-Robertson revenues and 6 percent of Dingell-Johnson funds. 
   Unfortunatly, these funds have been misdirected and misused by the Fish and Wildlife Service. Through their investment in the Federal Aid program, America's hunters and fisherman have proved themselves to be our nation's true conservationists. Through its misuse of these funds, the Fish and Wildlife Service has proven itself to be a negligent steward of the public trust. 
   The Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act, would restore accountability to the administration of Federal Aid funds. By limiting the amount of revenue that may be used on administration, and the accounts that these funds may be used for, this bill will reign in the opportunities for misuse by the Fish and Wildlife Service. Our legislation will also make legal a multi-state conservation grant program to allow streamlined funding for projects that involve multiple states. Additionally, the bill will increase funding for firearm and bow hunter safety programs. 
   This bill seeks to re-establish a trust between the hunters and anglers who pay the excise taxes and the federal government. It is an opportunity to repair a system that has been lauded as one of the nation's most successful conservation efforts. I hope my colleagues will join with us in a bipartisan effort to restore accountability and responsibility to the Federal Aid programs and the Fish and Wildlife Service.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to have a few moments to discuss with the American people this critical issue. The question of violence in our society is, as the Senator from Idaho, my colleague, has just stated, one we all want to address. The differences we have in this Chamber as we debate are not over whether we want to address the difficult problems of violence in our society; they are over how we believe it must best be done. The reason I wanted to stand and talk today is because I am convinced if we continue to focus our efforts on increased gun control and more strict gun control, not only will we impose burdens on law-abiding Americans that are unjustified, but we will fail to give the attention that is necessary to the true causes of the violence that we have to be addressing. I want to address my remarks in two contexts--one, what should we be focusing on and, two, why is it I believe gun control is not the answer. 
   I will talk about that second question first: Why is it that increased gun control is not the answer? Right here in Washington, DC, we have the best example of why we should not be looking to this as the best solution. In the past few months, there have been a lot of statements about a terrible incident of violence that took place at the National Zoo. I share my colleagues' concern about these high-profile acts of violence, but this example shows why it is that our focus on gun control is misdirected. The answer is not to enact more gun control laws but to address the root causes of violence. 
   The April 24 shooting at the National Zoo should shock any law-abiding American. At the same time, it dramatically demonstrates that even the more restrictive gun control laws in the Nation have little impact on the actions of violent criminals. In Washington, DC, it is illegal to possess the kind of handgun that was used in the violence at the National Zoo. It is not just illegal to carry them but one cannot even have one in one's home. Washington, DC, has the most restrictive gun control laws in the Nation, far more restrictive than the gun control laws being debated today. 
   Yet it is in Washington, DC, that this shooting took place--Washington, DC, which some have called the murder capital of the world, where gun violence runs rampant, from where many of the examples of gun violence come. 
   Yet it is Washington, DC, that has tried to solve these problems through restrictive gun control measures that we seem to debate endlessly on this floor. 
   Why is that the case? Some will argue the reason we do not have the solution in Washington, DC, is that we do not have restrictive gun laws everywhere and that the person who used this gun in Washington, DC, at the zoo could have gotten that gun elsewhere in the country and then brought it into Washington, DC. 
   The fact is, that is not what happened. This was a stolen gun that was used in Washington, DC, for this crime, and the reason is, one cannot just bring a gun into Washington, DC, under the law. For the last 32 years, under Federal law that applies to all States, one cannot buy a gun if one is a Washington, DC, resident and bring it into the District. Interstate sales of handguns have been prohibited for 32 years. 
   What would happen if a D.C. resident were to go to Maryland or Virginia seeking to buy a gun to bring into the District? What would happen is the gun dealer would say: I can't sell you this gun; I have to send this gun to a dealer in your State or in the District and have them deliver it to you there, and since it is illegal to do that in Washington, DC, I can't sell you this gun. 
   A person in Washington, DC, who wants to get a gun to use in an act of violence is, therefore, going to have to break the law, which is the point. Criminals do not obey the laws. Those who are going to use the gun in a crime do not obey these laws. They steal firearms, or they get them on the black market, or they do so illegally. That is exactly why in Washington, DC, those who carry guns do so illegally and know that the law-abiding citizens do not carry guns. 
   The shocking truth is that those who are involved in gun violence are going to get their guns illegally, whether they have gun control measures in place or not, and Washington, DC--right where we are conducting this debate--gives us the best example of why it is that further efforts to restrict citizens' 
   access to guns are not going to stop the violence. 
   What is going to stop the violence? I had an experience, it has been 6 or 8 months ago, watching one of the talk shows on TV that helped me to understand and increased my understanding of what we need to do. We often talk about needing to address the root causes of violence rather than continuing to restrict the right to bear arms. What do we mean when we say that? 
   Obviously, we talk about trying to reduce the violence our children are exposed to in the media, whether it be TV, video games, and so forth, and that is valid. We also talk about needing to have programs of education so that our young people who do have access to guns to hunt or for target shooting learn to do so in a safe way. 
   We also talk a lot on the floor about needing to enforce the laws strictly so that those who voluntarily choose to use guns in acts of violence are punished. If you do the crime, you should do the time. That is another aspect of what we need to do to address violence in our society. 
   When I was watching this talk show, one of the experts who was talking on the issue raised another approach which I think is something on which we need to focus. This particular gentleman who is an expert in this area said: I personally support gun control--his position--I support more gun control, and I support reducing violence in movies, in TV games, in video games, and in the music our children listen to. 
   He said those things are not going to solve the problem; that we actually have the ability today to identify the large majority of our young people who are troubled and who are the most high-risk young people to engage in a crime of violence. We ought to focus our efforts as a society on identifying these young people who are in troubled circumstances and intervening in their lives at an earlier stage so we can have a positive influence in their lives and steer them back on to a better course for their lives and for the lives of others whom they will touch. 
   That struck me. Instead of spending the time and the resources trying to figure out a way to stop people, even law-abiding people, from owning a firearm, what we ought to be doing is spending our time focusing on intervening in the lives of those who are troubled and who face these difficult circumstances and making a positive change in their lives. It is these kinds of efforts that will make a true difference. 
   Again, we will have large differences among ourselves as we continue this debate, but let's let no one in America misunderstand that we all seek the same objectives. We simply have a very different opinion on how to get there. I believe if we as a nation satisfy ourselves with passing some more restrictive gun control measures, pat ourselves on the back and say we have done our job for violence in America, we will be forgetting the real solutions. We will be diverting attention away from those things we have to do as a society to address the root problems of crime and the true root problems of violence. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today the Senate will immediately begin consideration of the Abraham-Mack amendment regarding merit pay for teachers. Following that debate, Senator MURRAY will be recognized to offer her amendment regarding class size. No time agreements have been made with regard to these amendments, and therefore votes will occur at a time to be determined in the future. Senators will be notified as votes are scheduled. 
   The Senate will not be in session tomorrow. However, it is expected that debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act will continue next week. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come to the floor today and speak with regard to the Educational Opportunities Act we will be debating later today. The Educational Opportunities Act represents an opportunity to make a striking change in education in America. I will quickly go over what it is that this act with which we are dealing will do. 
   Title I of the act is dedicated to helping disadvantaged children meet the high standards of education that we seek to have them achieve. 
   Title II is dedicated to improving teacher quality throughout the Nation. 
   Title III contains enrichment initiatives for our schools, including initiatives such as the gifted and talented programs; the advanced placement programs; help for neglected, delinquent, and at-risk students; and help for each school to meet each child's unique educational needs. 
   Title IV deals with developing safe and drug-free schools. 
   Title V deals with initiatives for educational opportunities, initiatives that will involve opportunities such as taking maximum advantage of the technology education we need to provide for our children. 
   Title VI involves innovative education where we give flexibility and power to the local teachers and parents to create innovative educational programs in their communities that will help empower students. 
   Title VII deals with bilingual education and language enhancement acquisition so those who need to develop the necessary skills to speak English can be given the assistance to do so. 
   Title VIII deals with impact aid, a form of aid critically important for those areas where the Federal Government creates an additional burden through its use of Federal property. And Title VIII deals with Indians, Native Hawaiians, and Alaskan Native education, dealing with specific needs throughout the Nation where we need focused efforts. 
   I thank the chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator JEFFORDS for his leadership on this bill. I also like to thank the ranking member, Senator KENNEDY, and all the members of the committee for their time and efforts to bring forth a bill that invests in public schools and offers our children an unparalleled opportunity for education reform and a better education. I commend all for your endeavors in tackling the tough decisions that face our schools and our children. 
   The pending ESEA bill offers students and parents a tremendous opportunity for better schools and a better education. Perhaps our greatest accomplishment in this bill is the reduction of Federal regulations. While the Federal financial contribution is approximately 7 percent of total education costs, the requirements currently placed on States represent a disproportionate burden in redtape and Federal control. 
   Granting waivers to States, and allowing them to bypass complex, confusing, and time consuming mandates, is one of the most important things S. 2 does to help schools reach their full potential. 
   In exchange for increased State and local flexibility, the Education Opportunities Act requires greater accountability for improving student performance. By establishing high standards and demanding accountability, this bill represents a great step toward ensuring the academic success of all students. 
   Senator GORTON's Straight A's proposal also allows interested States to consolidate up to twelve Federal formula grant programs in exchange for flexible approaches that boost student achievement. The Straight A's program gives States more flexibility in the use of Federal funds, so long as it can be demonstrated that the flexibility is used to achieve higher academic results for students. 
   Senator GREGG's efforts to promote portability should also be commended. This child-centered approach establishes per-pupil amounts to be used for supplemental services, such as tutoring. This change, would for the first time, ensure that the money follows the student. No longer will a school with title I students go without receiving funding for the very students it is asked to educate. 
   As I have looked through this bill and reviewed the various provisions, I am particularly pleased to see a number of measures I introduced earlier this year in separate legislation have been included. These bills focused on the growing needs of education in our rural communities. Earlier this year, I introduced an education bill--now title VI part B, the Rural Education Initiative--that would allow school districts to combine the small amounts of funding they may receive for specified programs, to accumulate a book of funds large enough to address local priorities. The committee recognized the unique challenges facing rural school districts by incorporating this important provision into the bill before us today. The students, parents, teachers, and administrators in Idaho appreciate your commitment to small, and sometimes poor, rural school districts. 
   Regarding title VIII and the Impact Aid Program, I am pleased to see legislation I authored earlier this year included in the bill. My legislation recommended changing the formulas by which Impact Aid funds are distributed to schools. This change, and other important changes in the bill before us, reaffirm our commitment to those children in schools where the loss of local property taxes due to a large Federal presence has placed an extra burden on local taxpayers. 
   The Educational Opportunities Act also ensures that teachers are an integral part of the effort to improve public education. The bill recognizes that strong professional development for our teachers is the foundation of our effort to facilitate improved student achievement. Whether professional development is emphasized through technology training, quality mentoring, or programs to recruit, hire, and train certified teachers, all which I proposed in legislation earlier this year, under this bill schools will have the flexibility to influence education based on local principles and local successes. Nothing can replace qualified teachers with high standards and a desire to teach. Coupled with professional development opportunities, our teachers must be equipped to positively influence and inspire every child in their classroom, and ultimately accelerate student achievement. 
   As I close, I would like to clarify one position that I have heard misstated, not only during this debate, but in various forums on education reform. Some have expressed the unwillingness of Republicans to adequately fund education initiatives like many of those we are debating today. Some individuals have gone so far as to say that we have proposed significant cuts. This is far from the truth. Last year's consolidated appropriations bill included significant funding increases for education. In fact, education was funded at $990 million above the President's budget request and $2.4 billion more than fiscal year 1999 levels. While there is a clear disagreement on how to spend education funds, I hope that we can proceed with an honest and accurate discussion about the support for adequate funding.  
   If we put our differences aside and work together to pass this bill, ESEA will be reauthorized for five years, with a price tag of nearly $160 billion. In 1965, the original ESEA bill was enacted to close the achievement gap between rich and poor students. I have yet to speak to a Senator who is not willing to provide the funds to achieve this worthy goal. But, I believe there are some Senators who share my concern that we will continue to fund a system where the original goal of this 35-year-old law is no closer to being met. Instead of narrowing the achievement gap, we see the gap actually widening. Too many of our students continue to perform at low standards, with many ranking near the bottom of a list of 21 industrialized nations in many subject areas. Continued Federal funding should be implemented with the goal of closing the achievement gap, and rewarding successful schools, rather than funneling money into failing programs. If our original goal remains--closing the achievement gap--it is not unreasonable for Federal funds to be tied to strict accountability standards. 
   Congress takes up the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act every 5 years. What we do now will significantly impact the lives of all students. We cannot sit around any more waiting to see if our old programs suddenly work. In 5 years, one child will have completed his or her elementary career. Another will graduate from high school and enter our increasingly demanding technological workforce. Are we willing to let another 5 years go by before making real changes? Are we willing to allow another child to be pushed through a failing system? I am not, and that is why the provisions and initiatives incorporated in this bill must be supported. 
   Education is the key that unlocks the future for our children, our State, our Nation, and there is no higher priority. I support the Educational Opportunities Act, which reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and I urge my colleagues to work together to pass a bill we can all take pride in supporting.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I bring your attention to the recent accomplishments of Lucas Moller. Lucas is 11 years old, a student of Russell Elementary School in Moscow, Idaho, and is currently helping NASA scientists develop sensitive and complex space equipment. 
   In December of 1999, Lucas was selected by the Planetary Society to have his invention used by NASA scientists on the Mars Surveyor 2001 mission. Mr. President, I know you join Idaho and myself in extending to Lucas congratulations on this achievement. 
   The Planetary Society asked kindergarten through 12th-grade students to design an experiment that would enhance the Mars Surveyor mission. After learning of this contest, Lucas studied the mission to determine what he could build. What Lucas came up with was both simple and ingenious. He constructed a thimble-sized cylinder designed to help scientists test the angle at which Martian dust falls off space equipment. This invention will allow scientists to learn what angle to position their equipment to prevent dust collecting and interfering with experiments.  
   When Lucas is not working with the Nation's top scientists on space exploration, he is developing his character with such distinguished organizations as the Boy Scouts. He excels at math and science and is involved in the gifted and talented program at school. 
   Mr. President, Lucas Moller is an outstanding example of what Idaho students can do with the proper encouragement and dedication. He is a role model for students and scientists of all ages and I am proud that he will represent his family and state in future space exploration. I know you and my colleagues in the Senate join me in offering our congratulations to Lucas.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to bring your attention to the recent accomplishment of the Wittman family from my home state of Idaho. Today, they will be receiving the Millennium Farm/Ranch Family Award for agricultural and forestry stewardship. I know you join Idaho and myself in extending to the Wittman family congratulations on this achievement. 
   The Wittman family has worked their land near Lapwai, Idaho since the early 1920's. They have used that knowledge to give us an on the ground perspective when we have written farm policy. Most recently, their views helped shape the reforms made to the crop insurance program. 
   Wittman Farms is a fourth-generation family farm operation using sound conservation and stewardship practices. In 1988, the family joined forces with the nearby Valley Boys and Girls Clubs to build ``Camp Wittman,'' a totally solar-powered destination where students and educators can share in a hands-on environmental experience to learn farming practices in the mountain meadow environment of the Palouse. 
   The Wittman Family has given to our youth, our educators, our local and national governments, and broken ground for more than just the purposes of next year's crop. 
   In these tough times for farmers, agriculture needs leaders who indeed look to the future while learning from the past. I am proud to honor the Wittman family as a Millennium Farm/Ranch Family Award winners and proud to call them fellow Idahoans. 
   It is indeed my pleasure as an Idaho Senator to honor the Wittman family as agriculture pioneers for Idaho--and to thank them for contributing so much to our next millennium in Agriculture. I know you and my colleagues in the Senate join me in offering our congratulations to the Wittman family. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. CRAPO. I am pleased to introduce today, with my colleague Senator SMITH of New Hampshire and Senator GORDON SMITH of Oregon, the ``Water Pollution Program Enhancements Act of 2000'' in response to a fast track rulemaking process undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency with respect to the total maximum daily load, or TMDL, and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, NPDES, permit programs under the Clean Water Act. The concerns over this rule are far too great and EPA is moving far too quickly for Congress to stand aside and allow this regulation to move ahead. My disagreement with the proposed rule is not its basic objective, which is aimed at cleaning up our Nation's waters--but the hurried approach EPA has elected to take, and their refusal to address the very numerous, very real concerns of states, cities, and stakeholders. 
   Huge strides have been made in cleaning up our nation's waters since the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972, particularly in the area of point source pollutants. But clearly, our work is not finished in trying to make our lakes, rivers and streams ``fishable and swimmable.'' More must be done to improve water quality, and more must especially be done to provide additional resources to address nonpoint source pollution, which, so far, has not received anywhere near the kind of funding that has been focused on discharges from point sources. 
   In the past month and a half, we have held two hearings on the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rule with respect to total maximum daily loads and the NPDES permit programs. The same subject has been examined in four other Congressional hearings by three separate committees. What we have collectively learned in these hearings about EPA's proposed rule is nothing short of alarming. States have responded with universal concern to this proposed rule that saddles them with enormous regulatory burdens and exorbitant costs in carrying out their water quality management programs. Not only is this proposed onerous and costly to implement, but States have testified that it is not likely to improve water quality, and, in fact, may have a detrimental effect on States with existing programs that have proven to be successful. 
   We would prefer not to be introducing this bill today. We have been holding hearings. I have been communicating with EPA--as have dozens of other Members of Congress expressing their grave concern with the proposed rule. We would prefer that Congress be working through these very important and challenging issues in collaboration with EPA. But holding hearings and attempting to work with EPA to resolve issues of concern, or urging them to take a more thoughtful, even-handed approach is no longer a reasonable course of action when the EPA steadfastly continues to insist on fast tracking a rule that has been the subject of such widespread concern and criticism.  
   When EPA issued this proposed regulation last August, we were all surprised at the boldness of the agency to publish the rule: 
   During the Congressional recess; and 
   Provide only a 60-day comment period on such as massive and complex rulemaking. 
   Not only did the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee request an extension of the comment period, but Congress was actually forced to enact legislation to compel EPA to listen. The EPA was forced to extend its comment period. EPA received more than 30,000 public comments on the proposed rule, and, as I said earlier, this rule has been the subject of six Congressional hearings. 
   To date, I do not see any evidence that EPA is listening. As recently as last week, EPA communicated that it had negotiated a 60-day OMB review--what is usually at least a 90-day review on major rulemaking efforts--and that it intends to finalize the rule by June 30. 
   The intransigence of the EPA is both unexplainable and unacceptable. If EPA is serious about ramming this regulation through by June 30, it is our intention to send them a loud message--Congress insists instead that they take a deep breath with respect to this rule. 
   The bill Senator SMITH and I are introducing today--the Water Pollution Program Enhancements Act--takes important steps toward achieving additional reductions in water pollution now, and providing the science necessary for better implementation of the TMDL program in the future. 
   In the hearings I held, witnesses raised three main concerns with respect to the proposed rule. They cited: 
   States' lack of reliable data for developing their 303(d) list of impaired waters; 
   The scarce public resources available for addressing nonpoint pollution in particular; and 
   EPA's overreach of its statutory authority under the 
   Clean Water Act in controlling water quality management programs administered by States. 
   This bill addresses those three issues without amending current law or regulation. 
   The Water Pollution Program Enhancement Act authorizes significantly increased funding for sections 106 and 319 under the Clean Water Act. Funding under section 106 would be made available to the States and specifically directed to: 
   Collect reliable monitoring data; 
   Improve their lists of impaired waters; 
   Prepare TMDLs; and 
   Develop watershed management strategies. 
   Of the $500 million available for implementation of section 319, $200 million is required to be made available by the States for grants to private landowners to carry out projects that will improve water quality. These funds are specifically being made available to farmers, ranches, family forestland managers and others, to conduct activities on their lands that contribute to cleaning up rivers, lakes and streams. 
   These significant increases in funding will achieve on-the-ground results and have a very real effect in improving our nation's water quality. 
   Second, the bill directs the Environmental Protection Agency to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to prepare a report on: 
   The quality of the science used to develop and implement TMDLs; 
   The costs associated with implementing TMDLs; and 
   The availability of alternative programs or mechanisms to reduce the discharge of pollutants from point sources and nonpoint source pollution. 
   If there is one message I have heard loud and clear, it is that we lack basic and necessary data about TMDLs and how to implement the TMDL program that achieves the goal of improving water quality, provides States flexibility in administering their programs, and is cost effective. It is irresponsible of EPA to push ahead in finalizing this regulation when we do not have the answers to such basic questions about this program. 
   Third, the bill provides for innovation and collaboration by establishing a pilot program in which five states are selected to implement a three-year program that examines alternative strategies and incentives to reduce the discharge of pollutants and TMDLs. This pilot program will provide us with valuable information about how we might think outside the box to solve our water quality problems. 
   Finally, this legislation requires EPA to postpone its rulemaking and review the National Academy of Sciences study before publishing its final rule on the TMDL program. Despite EPA's assertions to the contrary, we know that the proposed rule would have enormous implications for States, cities and stakeholders. It is absolutely critical that we know more about the science of TMDLs before finalizing this rule, and EPA has given Congress no other choice but to compel them to do so. Congress has an obligation to intercede and resolve these issues crucial to the health of our people and our environment. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in cleaning up our nation's waters through the reasonable and balanced provisions included in the Water Pollution Program Enhancements Act of 2000. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Water Adjudication Fee Fairness Act of 2000. This bill would require the federal government to pay the same filing fees and costs associated with state water rights' adjudications as is currently required of states and private parties. 
   To establish relative rights to water--water that is the lifeblood of many states, particularly in the west--states must conduct lengthy, complicated, and expensive proceedings in water rights' adjudications. In 1952, Congress recognized the necessity and benefit of requiring federal claims to be adjudicated in these state proceedings by adopting the McCarran Amendment. The McCarran Amendment waives the sovereign immunity of the United States and requires the federal government to submit to state court jurisdiction and to file water rights' claims in state general adjudication proceedings. 
   These federal claims are typically among the most complicated and largest of claims in state adjudications, and federal agencies are often the primary beneficiary of adjudication proceedings where states officially quantify and record their water rights. However, in 1992, the United States' Supreme Court held that, under existing law, the U.S. need not pay fees for processing federal claims. 
   When the United States does not pay a proportionate share of the costs associated with adjudications, the burden of funding the proceedings unfairly shifts to other water users and often delays completion of the adjudications by diminishing the resources necessary to complete them. Delays in completing adjudications result in the inability to protect private and public property interests or determine how much unappropriated water may remain to satisfy important environmental and economic development priorities. 
   Additionally, because they are not subject to fees and costs like other water users in the adjudication, federal agencies can file questionable claims without facing court costs, inflating the number of their claims for future negotiation purposes. This creates an unlevel playing field favoring the federal agencies and places a further financial and resources burden on the system. 
   For example, in the Snake River Basin Adjudication, which is in Idaho and is probably the largest water adjudication proceeding in the country, the United States Forest Service filed more than 3,700 federal claims. The Idaho Department of Water Resources expended thousands of dollars giving notice to all other claimants. 
   Additionally the State of Idaho and private claimants spent over $800,000 preparing objections to the Forest Service's claims. On the eve of the objective deadline, the U.S. withdrew all but 71 of the claims--the Department of Justices' explanation: litigation strategy. 
   This example is not an isolated incident. At best, the taxpayers and states should not be forced to incur these costs simply because the agency does not take the time to seriously evaluate its claims. At worst, the taxpayers should not bear the brunt of the federal government's Machiavellian tactics. 
   I recognize that the federal government has a legitimate right to some reserved water rights; however, the federal government should play by the same rules as the states and other private users. The Water Adjudication Fee Fairness Act is legislation that remedies this situation by subjecting the  United States, when party to a general adjudication, to the same fees and costs as state and private users in water rights adjudications. 
   This measure has the full support of the Western States Water Council and the Western Governor's Association. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting water users, taxpayers, the states, and welcome their co-sponsorship.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to authorize a national environmental grants program for small communities called Project SEARCH. 
   The national Project SEARCH (Special Environmental Assistance for the Regulation of Communities and Habitat) concept is based on a demonstration program that has been operating with great success in Idaho in 1999 and 2000. In short, the bill establishes a simplified application process for communities of under 2,500 individuals to receive assistance in meeting a broad array of federal, state, or local environmental regulations. Grants would be available for initial feasibility studies, to address unanticipated costs arising during the course of a project, or when a community has been turned down or underfunded by traditional sources. The grant program would require no match from the recipients. 
   Some of the major highlights of the program are: 
   A simplified application process--no special grants coordinators required; 
   No unsolicited bureaucratic intrusions into the decision-making process; 
   Communities must first have attempted to receive funds from traditional sources; 
   It is open to studies or projects involving any environmental regulation; 
   Applications are reviewed and approved by citizens panel of volunteers; 
   The panel chooses number of recipients and size of grants; 
   The panel consists of volunteers representing all regions of the state; and 
   No local match is required to receive the SEARCH funds. 
   Over the past several years, it has become increasing apparent that small communities are having problems complying with environmental rules and regulations due primarily to lack of funding, not a willingness to do so. They, like all of us, want clean water and air and a healthy natural environment. Sometimes, they simply cannot shoulder the financial burden with their limited resources. 
   In addition, small communities wishing to pursue unique collaborative efforts might be discouraged by grant administrators who prefer conformity. Some run into unexpected costs during a project and have borrowed and bonded to the maximum. Others are in critical habitat locations and any project may have additional costs, which may not be recognized by traditional financial sources. Still others just need help  for the initial environmental feasibility study so they can identify the most effective path forward. 
   With these needs in mind, in 1998, I was able to secure $1.3 million through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for a demonstration grant program for Idaho's small communities. Idaho's program does not replace other funding sources, but serves as a final resort when all other means have been exhausted. 
   The application process was simplified so that any small town mayor, county commissioner, sewer district chairman, or community leader could manage it without hiring a professional grant writer. An independent citizens committee with statewide representation was established to make the selections and get the funds on the ground as quickly as possible. No bureaucratic or political intrusions were permitted. 
   Although the EPA subsequently insisted that grants be limited to water and wastewater projects, forty-four communities in Idaho ultimately applied, not including two that failed to meet the eligibility requirements. Ultimately, twenty-one communities were awarded grants in several categories, and ranged in size from $9,000 to $319,000. A Native American community, a migrant community, and several innovative collaborative efforts were included in the successful applicants. The communities that were not selected are being given assistance in exploring other funding sources and other advice. 
   The response and feedback from all participants has been overwhelming positive. Environmental officials from the state and EPA who witnessed the process have stated that the process worked well and was able to accomplish much on a volunteer basis. There was even extraordinary appreciation from other funding agencies because some communities they were not able to reach were provided funds for feasibility studies. The only negative comments were from those who wished that the EPA had not limited the program to water and wastewater projects. 
   The conclusion of all participants was that Project SEARCH is a program worthy of being expanded nationally. So many small communities in so many states can benefit from a program that assists underserved and often overlooked communities. This legislation provides us the opportunity to help small communities throughout the United States.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. This bill, which unanimously passed the House of Representatives on March 1, would end the practice of withholding a portion of Social Security benefits simply because a beneficiary chooses to work beyond the statutory retirement age. 
   The Social Security earnings test has always been one of the most illogical aspects of the Social Security system. Under current law, a beneficiary between the ages of 65 and 69 may only earn up to $17,000 without losing benefits. After that amount, $1 of Social Security benefit is lost for every $3 of earnings. 
   Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have supported efforts to minimize the effect of the earnings test. For example, in 1998, I supported the Taxpayer Relief Act which would have raised the level of exempt income to $39,750 in 2008. Unfortunately, the 105th Congress adjourned before the Senate could consider this legislation. While raising the earnings limit would have been a step in the right direction, a total elimination of the earning test is clearly the right thing to do. 
   The Social Security Administration estimates that 800,000 beneficiaries are affected by the earnings test. People spend a lifetime putting that money into their Social Security accounts and they ought to have full access to it without limiting their other opportunities for making an income. The present system is holding them down, it is holding the economy down, and it should be changed. It is wrong to withhold any portion of a benefit that was duly earned by years of work and contributions to the system. Social Security was not meant as a single source of retirement income. Why then does the government penalize those seniors who choose to earn additional income through work? This is especially confusing in a time of low unemployment when companies are desperately looking for skilled and experienced employees. Government should encourage self-sufficiency, not penalize it. 
   I am pleased that H.R. 5 will be brought to a vote shortly. I am a cosponsor of a similar bill introduced by Senator ASHCROFT. These bills would completely eliminate the earnings test for Social Security recipients who have reached retirement age, allowing them to earn outside income without a reduction in benefits. What we have now is a disincentive for people to work who want to continue to contribute to our growing economy. Any meaningful reform of Social Security should preserve the system and allow those who want to work to continue to do so. This measure is the right thing to do and is long overdue. 
   I congratulate the House of Representatives on its unanimous passage of this bill and am encouraged that President Clinton has voiced his support for the bill. I would also like to thank Senator ASHCROFT for his leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues  to join me in passing this bill and restoring a measure of fairness for senior citizens.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare Wage-Index Reclassification Act of 2000. This bill will amend the Social Security Act to redirect additional Medicare reimbursements to rural hospitals. Currently, hospitals throughout the country are losing Medicare reimbursements, which results in severe implications for surrounding communities. 
   As you know, in an attempt to keep Medicare from consuming its limited reserves, Congress enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), which made sweeping changes in the manner that health care providers are reimbursed for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries. These were the most significant modifications in the history of the program.  
   All of the problems with the BBA--whether hospitals, nursing facilities, home health agencies, or skilled nursing facilities--are especially acute in rural states, where Medicare payments are a bigger percentage of hospital revenues and profit margins are generally much lower. These facilities were already managed at a highly efficient level and had ``cut the fat out of the system.'' Therefore, the cuts implemented in the BBA hit the rural communities in Idaho and throughout the United States in a very significant and serious way. 
   In the 1st session, the Senate Finance Committee did a tremendous job of bringing forth legislation that adjusted Medicare payments to health care providers hurt by cuts ordered in the BBA. While this was a meaningful step, the Senate must continue to address the inequities in the system. 
   My bill would expand wage-index reclassification by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to deem a hospital that has been reclassified for purposes of its inpatient wage-index to also reclassify for purposes of other services which are provider-based and for which payments are adjusted using a wage-index. In other words, this legislation would require the Secretary to use a hospital's reclassification wage-index to adjust payments for hospital outpatient, skilled nursing facility, home health, and other services, providing those entities are provider-based. This change should have been made in BBA when Congress required that prospective payment systems be established for these other services. As such, this change would address an issue that has been left unaddressed for several years. 
   It makes sense that, if a hospital has been granted reclassification by the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board for certain inpatient services, it also be granted wage-index reclassification for outpatient and other services. It is estimated that this provision would help approximately 400 hospitals, 90 percent which are rural. Furthermore, this provision would be budget neutral. 
   I know my colleagues in the Senate share my commitment of promoting access to health care services in rural areas. Expanding wage-index geographic reclassification will allow hospitals to recoup lost funds and use those funds to address patients' needs in an appropriate, effective, and meaningful way. I encourage my colleagues to co-sponsor the Medicare Wage-Index Reclassification Act.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to make a statement in recognition of one of my very close friends out in Idaho who has just had a wonderful accomplishment in his life. He is a neighbor, a friend, and a member of my staff from Idaho, Don Dixon. 
   On March 24, Don will be given the distinct honor of induction into the Eastern Idaho Agriculture Hall of Fame. The honor reflects his commitment to farming in Idaho and the respect and esteem in which he is held in our community. I know you join eastern Idaho and myself in extending to Don congratulations on this achievement. 
   Don is a lifelong farmer and resident of Idaho Falls, ID. He owns and tends the farm his grandfather purchased in 1900 and, thereafter, was owned by his father. Apparently, the farming bug hit Don hard because he took over the Dixon operation with his brother soon after college and his military service. A measure of his success is reflected by his continued expansion of the farm and livestock and the handover of a solid operation to his son. 
   For years, Don's work has produced some of the region's best potatoes, in a State that has the world's finest spuds, cattle, hay, and grain. In this time of agriculture distress and low prices, Don has demonstrated himself to be a model farmer by taking steps to protect the environment by undertaking the best management practices and water conservation through improved irrigation techniques. We can all be proud of his work to be a productive member of the agriculture community and a good steward of the land. 
   Although his induction into the Hall of Fame is a special accomplishment, Don has long been chosen as a representative of his community. He has been an active member of eastern Idaho's business and agriculture organizations for as long as I can remember. Don has served on the board of the Eastern Idaho State Fair and, for 6 years, served on the Idaho Potato Commission, a post nominated by our Governor. His recognition at the national level is evident from Don's successes as Director of the National Potato Promotion Board. 
   In 1995, Don joined my staff and served with distinction through the balance of my House tenure, working on agriculture and natural resources issues. He was instrumental in my work with farmers and ranchers throughout the State during the debate on the 1996 farm bill. When I was elected to the Senate in 1998, Don agreed to continue our partnership by becoming my State Director of Agriculture, a position he has fulfilled with distinction and widely-held respect. 
   Don has served the people of Idaho above and beyond the call of duty, meeting more farmers and community leaders than any of his peers and probably has logged enough miles on his pickup truck to circumnavigate the world several times. The patience and understanding of his wife Georgia, his four children, and extended family for his work is a testament to Don's commitment to service and leadership in eastern Idaho's agriculture community. 
   Don's generosity and good-natured approach to life and work is also reflected in his induction into the Eastern Idaho Agriculture Hall of Fame. He is a valued counselor and friend of my entire family. I salute him on the accomplishment of this high honor. I know you and my colleagues in the Senate join me in offering our congratulations to Don Dixon. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Amateur Radio Spectrum Protection Act of 2000. This bill would help preserve the amount of radio spectrum allocated to the Amateur Radio Service during this era of dramatic change in our telecommunications system. I am pleased to introduce this bipartisan measure with my colleagues, Senator COLLINS, Senator AKAKA, Senator BOB SMITH, Senator SNOWE, and Senator LINCOLN. 
   Organized radio amateurs, more commonly known as ``ham'' operators, through formal agreements with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Weather Service, the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and other government and private relief services, provide emergency communication when regular channels are disrupted by disaster. In Idaho, these trained volunteers have performed tasks as various as helping to rescue stranded back-country hikers, organizing cleanup efforts after the Payette River flooded, and helping the Forest Service communicate during major forest fires. In other communities, they may be found monitoring tornado touchdowns in the Midwest, helping authorities reestablish communication after a hurricane in the Gulf or sending ``health and welfare'' messages following an earthquake on the West Coast. Not only do they provide these services using their own equipment and without compensation, but they also give their personal time to participate in regular organized training exercises. 
   In addition to emergency communication, amateur radio enthusiasts use their spectrum allocations to experiment with and develop new circuitry and techniques for increasing the effectiveness of the precious natural resource of radio spectrum for all Americans. Much of the electronic technology we now take for granted is rooted in amateur radio experimentation. Moreover, amateur radio has long provided the first technical training for youngsters who grow up to be America's scientists and engineers. 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to conduct spectrum auctions to raise revenues. Some of that revenue may come from the auction of current amateur radio spectrum. This bill simply requires the FCC to provide the Amateur Radio Service with equivalent replacement spectrum if it reallocates and auctions any of the Service's current spectrum. 
   The Amateur Radio Spectrum Protection Act of 2000 will protect these vital functions while also maintaining the flexibility of the FCC to manage the nation's telecommunications infrastructure effectively. It will not interfere with the ability of commercial telecommunications services to seek the spectrum allocations they require. I ask my colleagues to join the more than 670,000 U.S. licensed radio amateurs in supporting this measure and welcome their co-sponsorship.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will help our domestic semiconductor industry continue to thrive. The proposal that I am introducing today, along with my colleague from Idaho, Senator Larry CRAIG, merely extends an existing temporary duty suspension for certain semi-manufactured forms of gold. Specifically, the bill amends the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule to extend, until December 31, 2005, the duty-free treatment of gold bonding wire. This product is critical to the manufacture of semiconductors and integrated circuits. 
   The Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1996 suspended the 4.9 percent duty given to gold bond wiring classified under Harmonized Tariff Number 7108.13.7000. This temporary duty suspension expires on December 31, 2000 and should be renewed. This is particularly true given that the duty on most other products used in the manufacture of semiconductors were removed during the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations which concluded in 1994. Members of the U.S. semiconductor industry believe the failure to include gold bonding wire in the list of duty eliminations was more of an oversight than anything else. This legislation helps rectify this situation. 
   The gold bonding wire essential to the manufacture of semiconductors and integrated circuits is unique in its fineness, purity and application. The nearly 100 percent pure gold wire whose diameter measures 0.05 millimeters or less has no other known purposes or uses other than those associated with the assembly of semiconductors. 
   U.S. semiconductor manufacturers that assemble their products domestically rather than abroad will be adversely impacted if this duty suspension lapses. A duty of almost five percent on gold bond wiring would increase the cost of doing business for American companies that choose to assemble their goods in this country. We should support, not hinder, efforts like this one that are a win-win for the American labor force and our nation's economy. More hardworking Americans are employed when the assembly process occurs domestically. Furthermore, lower costs encourage more U.S. companies to conduct these activities at home. In the end, this provides a boost to the overall economic well-being of the United States.

   Mr. CRAPO. 
    Mr. President, I rise today in support of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and am pleased to be introducing five bills that will benefit teachers and students all across this Nation. Collectively, these measures create a package of fundamental reform to the ESEA bill. These pieces of legislation complement existing programs that have proven to work successfully in schools and they provide assistance and support in areas where educators have expressed the greatest need. And these measures represent my commitment to improving the quality of education so that all of our children can achieve their greatest potential. 
   First, I am introducing a measure to strengthen the Federal Impact Aid program. Specifically, my bill, which is supported by the National Association of Federally Impacted Schools, recommends increasing the weighted Federal student units for off-base military children and for civilian dependent children. Knowing that Impact Aid funds help 1.6 million federally-connected children, as well as 1,600 school districts serving over 17 million students, I am confident that my colleagues in the Senate support increases in funding for the Impact Aid program. But some of them may not be familiar with the formulas by which these funds are distributed to schools. Changing the computation of repayment will assure that funds will be distributed in a more equitable manner, reflecting the composition of local education agencies. 
   The simple changes, which I am proposing, will benefit children in schools where the loss of local property taxes due to a large Federal presence has placed an extra burden on local taxpayers. We must make up the difference for all the children in the Impact Aid program, not just a select few. 
   The second bill that I am proposing would build on the strong educational technology infrastructure already in place in school districts in nearly every state. As you know, education technology can significantly improve student achievement. Congress has recognized this fact by continually voting to dramatically increase funding for education technology. In fact, in just the programs under ESEA, federal support has grown from $52.6 million in Fiscal Year 1995, to $698 million just four years later. 
   But we need to do more than simply place computers in classrooms. We need to provide our educators with the skills they need to incorporate evolving educational technology in the classroom. My bill does exactly that. It will encourage states to develop and implement professional development programs that train teachers in the use of technology in the classroom. Effective teaching strategies must incorporate educational technology if we are to ensure that all children have the skills they need to compete in a high-tech 
   workplace. An investment in professional development for our teachers is an investment in our children and our future. 
   Third, continuing on the lines of professional development, I am introducing a bill that outlines the essential components of mentoring programs that would improve the experience of new teachers and reduce the high turn-over currently seen among beginning teachers. My legislation will ensure program quality and accountability by providing that teachers mentor their peers who teach the same subject. The mentoring programs that are created in this legislation must comply with state standards. Additionally, the bill will provide incentives, and grant states the flexibility to create alternative teacher certification and licensure programs, to recruit well-educated and talented people into the teacher profession. 
   The recruitment and retention of good teachers is paramount to improving our national education system. Mentor programs provide teachers with the support of a senior colleague. And under the supervision and guidance of a colleague, teachers are able to develop skills and achieve a higher level of proficiency. The confidence and experience gained during this time will improve the quality of instruction, which in turn will improve overall student achievement. 
   Fourth, attracting and retaining quality teachers is a difficult task, especially in rural impoverished areas. As a result, teacher shortages and high turnover are commonplace in rural  communities in almost every state in the nation. The fourth education bill I am introducing today would allow the Secretary of Education to direct a portion of the general funds in ESEA to rural impoverished areas. Under this proposal, a needy rural school district could prevent the exodus of qualified teachers by first creating incentive programs to retain teachers; second, improve the quality of the teacher through enhanced professional development; and, third, hire new teachers. This bill recognizes the unique challenges facing rural school districts and allows them the option of addressing these challenges. 
   The final bill, is the only one being introduced today with an authorization for appropriation. It makes Federal grant programs more flexible in order to help school districts in rural communities. Under this provision, districts would be able to combine the funds from specified programs and use the money to support local or statewide education reform efforts intended to improve the achievement of elementary school and secondary school students and the quality of instruction provided. This measure asks for an authorization of $125 million for small rural and poor rural schools--a small price that could produce large results. 
   The goal of these bills, which I have briefly outlined, are threehold: 1) to provide teachers with the tools to grow as professionals; 2) to 
   assist rural school districts so that they may compete competitively with other school districts that oftentimes have more money and resources; and, (3) to provide every child with unsurpassed education opportunities. Together, these are the keys to our children's success. 
   In reauthorizing ESEA, Congress has an extraordinary opportunity to change the course of education. We must embrace this opportunity by supporting creative and innovative reform proposals, like the ones that I have introduced here today. I am committed to working in the best interest of our children to develop an education system that is the best in the world. These bills move us in the right direction and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting these measures. I urge the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to incorporate these provisions into the upcoming ESEA bill.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1287, a bill to provide for the storage of spent nuclear fuel, pending completion of the permanent nuclear waste repository. 
   I also want to thank Senator CRAIG and Senator MURKOWSKI for their tireless efforts to move forward on legislation to address the issue of disposing of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. 
   The federal government made a commitment to the nation's nuclear utilities that it would build a permanent repository to dispose of commercial spent nuclear fuel. By law, the repository was supposed to be ready to accept nuclear waste by 1998. 
   Six billion dollars later, the Department of Energy effort to build a repository is years behind schedule and mired in political warfare. 
   As a result of these delays, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the DOE had failed to meet its legal obligations and ordered the Department to pay contractual damages to the nuclear utilities. 
   If the current situation is allowed to continue, the utilities will be paying twice. They have already contributed to the nuclear waste fund to build the repository. Without this legislation, they will continue to pay for the repository and on site storage for waste the federal government said it would take. 
   As a result of national defense and research activities, the federal government itself has generated thousands of tons of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. This waste continues to be monitored and stored at federal sites across the country, including the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, at significant cost. This waste is also waiting to be sent to a permanent repository. 
   The financial resources that are necessary to continuously store, monitor, and maintain this fuel and waste are overwhelming and could be used for other constructive purposes by the government and utilities instead of watching and waiting as has been the past practice. 
   This bill offers an option for relief to utilities where the Department of Energy could take title to the fuel and transport it to the repository site. Different from past legislation, this bill identifies that spent fuel storage at the repository site, in advance of fuel placement in a repository, cannot occur until construction of the repository has been authorized. 
   This bill is particularly important to the State of Idaho because of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. This agreement was entered into in Federal court. It was agreed to by the Departments of Energy and Navy and the State of Idaho. One of the requirements is to remove all spent fuel from Idaho by 2035. A repository or interim storage site is essential for the parties to comply with the agreement. 
   The logical location for the permanent repository is Yucca Mountain. It has been designated by Congress as the only site for study. It is located on dry Federal desert land. It is adjacent to the Nation's nuclear testing site where hundreds of nuclear weapons have been exploded. 
   The bill establishes a schedule for decisions on the adequacy of Yucca Mountain as a repository which will allow the parties to comply with the Idaho Settlement Agreement. The bill also deletes the 70,000 metric ton uranium cap which had been imposed on the repository. Removal of this cap allows one geological repository to be capable of handling the nation's inventory of spent fuel and high-level waste instead of multiple repositories. 
   The bill allows the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and National Academy of Sciences to give input on the scientific validity and protection of the public health and safety provided by the proposed Environmental Protection Agency radiation standard. The Environmental Protection Agency maintains standard setting authority, cannot set a standard until June 1, 2001, and is not bound to accept or even consider the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or National Academy of Sciences input. This compromise only delays the setting of a radiation standard by the Environmental Protection Agency and delays the date by when the Secretary of Energy will have an established radiation standard to work to. Although I dislike the compromise that was reached I understand that a compromise needed to be made to move this important legislation forward. 
   Support of this bill is the right thing to do for the country. 
   Idaho is one of several states where defense and DOE spent nuclear fuel and high level waste are stored; other major states include Washington, South Carolina, and New York. 
   There are over 70 commercial nuclear utilities that are storing spent nuclear fuel because the federal government has not lived up to its contract. 
   Storage facilities at these locations are filling up quickly, will not last forever, and will be expensive to monitor and maintain.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I applaud Senator SMITH, the new chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, for this effort on behalf of the Senate to honor our late friend, John Chafee. 
   Although not widely-known,the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) statute is an important component of our national commitment to balancing the needs of our environment, minimizing risks to human life, and fiscal responsibility. Being such a careful balance, the act reflects John Chafee's approach to legislating--fair, deliberate, and environmentally conscious. 
   In 1982, the then-chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Environmental Pollution, Senator Chafee, became the leading champion of efforts to address problems caused by development on highly erodible coastal areas. The CBRA concept took a unique approach to protecting these coastal areas, not by instituting a wide range of new federal regulations as some suggested, but by prohibiting certain federal spending that could promote development that would not otherwise take place. 
   Subsequent reauthorization of the act in 1990 significantly expanded the CBRA System and incorporated ``Otherwise Protected Areas'' into the protective umbrella. Today, the CBRA System includes 585 units and 274 OPAs, comprising over 3 million acres of coastal barriers. 
   CBRA does not prohibit development in coastal areas, nor deny private or non-federal funds from being spent even with the CBRA System. It does, however, protect taxpayer dollars--including flood insurance, loans, grants, and assisting infrastructure projects--from being spent on development projects in areas where the very instability of the terrain makes development a risky proposition. It also discourages development in areas where  human life is at increased risk from the full force of coastal weather events.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the pending Ashcroft amendment to H.R. 434, the African trade bill. As a reminder, there will be a cloture vote on the substitute amendment 1 hour after convening tomorrow. It is still hoped that an agreement can be reached to allow the Senate to complete action on this trade bill by the end of the week. The Senate may also consider any legislative or executive items cleared for action. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to join so many of my colleagues in making a few remarks about our colleague, Senator John Chafee. 
   As we all know, many of us have risen over the last 2 days to speak of our memories of Senator Chafee and the friendships we have developed with him over the years. Because of my short time in the Senate, my experiences with Senator Chafee are more limited, but I have had ample time to observe Senator Chafee as the good, kind, and honorable man so many of my colleagues have spoken about in the last couple of days. 
   I can recall when I first came to the Senate and we were organizing. I wondered what my committee assignments would be. John Chafee, knowing of the interest of Idaho in natural resource issues, came to me and said I ought to try to get on the Environment and Public Works Committee which he chaired. I said: I would love to work with you on that committee. When the appropriate opportunity to make a selection came along, I ultimately did, make that choice and had the chance to work with Senator Chafee. 
   John Chafee represented what is good about American politics. Senator Chafee was a man of the highest principles and utmost integrity. The Washington Post referred to him as ``a gentle but stubborn champion.'' That is exactly right. 
   I was remarking to one of our colleagues as we walked back from the Capitol Building after a matter of business earlier today that John was always friendly and helpful and was such a kind man, but he was also a firm man in championing the principles he advocated. I believe that description of him, ``a gentle but stubborn champion,'' is a very apt way to describe him. 
   John Chafee was deeply committed to the issues he undertook to fight for, and, at the same time, he was always a gentleman and a statesman. Senator Chafee was instantaneously a likable person. Part of his charm was he was entirely unassuming and friendly. 
   Perhaps what made his demeanor more unique was he had enjoyed such an impressive career. Senator Chafee clearly worked hard to make a difference throughout his entire life. His career accomplishments were extraordinary, but then he was an extraordinary man. These things have already been said, but I want to repeat them. 
   He served in World War II at Guadalcanal and Korea. He was a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School and served in the Rhode Island House of Representatives and as Governor of Rhode Island. In 1969, he was appointed Secretary of the Navy and served in that post for 3 1/2 years during one of the most critical times in our history. 
   Senator Chafee's life's work has been furthering the issues he believed would make America a better place. His commitment to the issues and his good nature are what I will miss the most. 
   I knew if I needed to talk with someone who would have a unique and heartfelt perspective on an issue we were debating, all I had to do was sit down at his desk, where there are now flowers, and talk to John. He would have thought through the issue carefully and whatever his position on it, he would have a good, balanced, thoughtful reason for it. 
   I particularly want to share some of the personal experiences I have had with him. 
   Being from a different part of the country--I come from the West and John comes from the Northeast--it is no secret those of us from different parts of the country often approach environmental issues and some of the natural resource issues in a different way, and that was true about John and me on some of the issues. We found a lot of common ground where we worked together, and we found those issues where we were different. 
   What was always remarkable to me is that he was always willing to work with me to try to understand my point of view and to see if the issues and concerns of the people I represent in Idaho could be squared with the issues and the concerns of the people he represented in Rhode Island, and if the interests of the Nation could be brought together in a solution that found common ground, that was one of his strengths. 
   I note he always engaged the people in our hearings in a friendly fashion that made them feel at home and at ease. He took a direct interest in legislation and in each committee member's personal interest in legislation which was important to them. 
   He personally worked closely with me on legislation on which we found we could develop common ground. It is because he chose to make his life one of service that so many people today stand in honor of him. America truly lost one of our great leaders. I believe he stands as a tremendous example to all of us of the kind of difference you can make if you are willing to put your life into the service of the people of this country. 
   John Chafee truly did that. On behalf of all of us in America, I say thank you.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Executive Orders Limitation Act of 1999. 
   A growing number of Americans have expressed concern that President Clinton has sought to bypass the constitutional role of Congress by issuing Executive orders or proclamations that have the force of law and the practical impact of law. Indeed, the use of Executive orders has increased dramatically. For example, the first 24 Presidents issued 1,262 Executive orders, whereas the last 17 Presidents have issued 11,798 orders. 
   The bill I introduce today seeks to strengthen article I of the Constitution which grants all legislative powers to the Congress. The bill seeks to strengthen our system of checks and balances by ensuring that all Executive orders are based on the President's expressed constitutional or statutory authority. The bill would require the President to cite the exact constitutional or statutory authority he is exercising when he issues an Executive order. It would require the publication of a cost-benefit analysis and a public comment period before an Executive order can take effect. 
   The act would also provide for expedited judicial review of questionable Executive orders. The Congress has previously set limits on the President's ability to issue Executive orders when it required that all orders be printed in the Federal Register. My bill would not in any way limit the President's ability to issue an Executive order which he has the constitutional right to issue. The Executive Orders Limitation Act of 1999 seeks to preserve the constitutional separation of powers by safeguarding Congress' legislative power, while at the same time protecting the President's constitutional and statutory authorities. 
   The question of how a law is enacted in America was one of the most important and significant debates in our constitutional convention. That is why we have a system of government established under our Constitution by which it is the Congress that makes the law that governs this Nation. The President then decides, as he has the right to do, whether to sign that law or not. We do not have a system where one man or even one branch of our Government has the ability to unilaterally create law. Yet that is what the practical effect of the use of Executive orders has become in today's timeframe in the way that President Clinton has begun using these Executive order powers. 
   This legislation will bring appropriate controls to the issue. If the President has constitutional or statutorily delegated authority to issue Executive orders in a given area, those authorities and those rights are preserved. But in those areas where Congress or the Constitution have not given the President the authority to enact and act as though he were imposing new legal requirements, then that is prohibited. 
   This legislation is critical. It should not be deemed a threat to anyone from any particular perspective on any issue. It should be deemed what it is, an effort to restore the balance of power and the system of government, in particular the system of making laws our constitutional founders intended when they created the Constitution of this country.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Dietary Supplement Fairness in Labeling and Advertising Act. The purpose of the legislation is to reaffirm Congress' intent in enacting the Dietary Supplement Health Education Act (DSHEA). In enacting DSHEA, Congress intended to insure that all Americans had access to factual information about vitamins and other dietary supplements so that they can make informed decisions about their health and well-being. 
   In recent years, the prevalence of scientific data demonstrating the benefits of proper nutrition, education, and appropriate use of dietary supplements to promote long-term health has increased tremendously. Additionally, preventative practices, including the safe consumption of dietary supplements, has been shown to significantly reduce the health-care expenditures in this country. That is why I continue to support research efforts that focus on preventative care. The role government funding can have in achieving scientific and medical gains in crucial. Past successes have frequently led to rapid technological advancements in medicine, biotechnology, and other important areas that shape our lives. 
   Over 100 million people use dietary supplements daily throughout the United States. This bill that I am introducing would allow access by the public to solid scientific research about the safe and proper use of dietary supplements. It prevents the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from promulgating rules that change the intent of congressional regulations regarding structure and function claims and would amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to provide that certain types of advertisements for dietary supplements are proper. 
   DSHEA required the FDA to promulgate reasonable guidelines to regulate the content of dietary supplements labels. The goal of this requirement is to insure that the labels give consumers information necessary for them to decide whether they want to take a particular supplement, without making claims regarding medical or disease benefits (which are reserved for FDA-approved drugs). 
   The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) currently enforces a standard for advertising that conflicts with the intent of DSHEA. The FTC does not always allow the same information in advertising of dietary supplements that is allowed in labeling of the same products. For instance, the FTC has made it difficult to advertise the benefits of calcium, vitamin C, and other common and heavily studied supplements. 
   The information that the FDA allows as part of the labeling of a dietary supplement should also be allowed in advertising that same supplement, yet the FTC is seeking to regulate the advertising of dietary supplements by denying to consumers some of the very information that DSHEA required the FDA to let them use. This forces manufacturers to work under two sets of contradictory regulations and undermines the intent of Congress. 
   Additionally, this bill would instruct the FDA to withdraw the notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register of April 29, 1998, which attempts to regulate the types of statements made concerning the effects of dietary supplements on the structure or function of the body. The FDA is asserting responsibilities beyond congressional intent. Specifically, it is  seeking to change the definition of ``disease'' by deeming improper any claim that refers to the ``prevention or treatment of abnormal functions.'' In these cases, the product would be subject to regulation as a drug, rather than a dietary supplement. Furthermore, it was never Congress' intent to disallow the use of citations from credible scientific publications in providing accurate information in labeling of dietary supplements. Numerous, common sense examples can be made to demonstrate the irresponsible nature of this rule. Aging and pregnancy would now be considered diseases under the policy. 
   In passing this legislation, my hope is to continue to open up communication and provide access to fair and adequate reviews of all claims. This bill prescribes a method by which the Commission must act prior to filing a complaint that initiates any administrative or judicial proceeding alleging noncompliance by an advertiser. Simply, the FTC would be required to provide a full and fair opportunity for advertisers to consult with the Commission's scientific experts. Decisions about the use of dietary supplements should not be made by bureaucrats. Instead, meetings with scientific experts would provide for an open exchange of ideas and information, and ensure that decisions are based on concrete, substantial scientific evidence. This is good government practice, and during a time where our society has become far too litigious, I support strengthening the review process, prior to filing any claims or complaints. 
   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Dietary Supplement Fairness in Labeling and Advertising Act. It would insure that all Americans have access to factual information about vitamins and other dietary supplements so they can make informed decisions about their health and well-being, while continuing to provide adequate safeguards to protect the public good.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to two groups of exceptional young men from my State of Idaho. 
   In August, the South Central Boise Little League team from Boise, ID, became the first little league team from Idaho ever to compete in the Little League World Series. Under the leadership of Stan McGrady, this team of 11-and 12-year-olds completed an underdog run to win the Western Regional Pennant and advance to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA. They won one game and lost two in the World Series, but, more importantly, showed an impressive amount of maturity and sportsmanship and represented our state in an exemplary manner. 
   Furthermore, the Madison Cats of Rexburg, ID, ended a successful season by competing in the Babe Ruth League World Series in Clifton Park, NY. This team of 14-year-olds, coached by Randy Sutton, went undefeated in both the state and regional tournaments to earn the right to represent the Pacific Northwest in the Babe Ruth World Series. 
   Along with the entire State of Idaho, I am very proud of these young men. Their accomplishments show a level of dedication and teamwork that will benefit them for many years to come. They were exceptional ambassadors for Idaho. I congratulate them, their parents, and their communities on these unprecedented accomplishments.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I thank Senators GORTON and BYRD for inclusion of an amendment to provide funding for a voluntary enrollment, cold water fish habitat conservation plan (HCP) in the States of Idaho and Montana. This project is already authorized under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) were authorized in 1982 to allow private landowners where endangered species are found a chance to write site-specific management plans and, in some cases, allow other activity to continue on those lands. A project similar to this involving the Karner Blue Butterfly in Wisconsin is considered an HCP success story. 
   In Idaho alone, of the 2,639,633 acres of State-owned endowment land, over half is bull trout habitat. Wise and productive use of state endowment land is essential to the funding of education in Idaho and this use could be jeopardized should it be called into question as a ``take'' under Section 9 of the ESA. The large area comprising bull trout habitat complicates not only natural resource uses of the land, but the management strategy of involved agencies in addressing habitat for the bull trout. With the huge land area involved, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Idaho concurs that a cooperative effort will be necessary to effect management practices to benefit the bull trout. The States of Idaho and Montana have already been active in addressing bull trout habitat needs--last year, they spent nearly $1 million collectively to promote bull trout recovery. 
   It is clear that a cooperative effort, involving the States of Idaho and Montana, the USFWS, and private forest owners will be necessary to address the challenge of providing clean, cold water for bull trout habitat. The formulation of a voluntary enrollment, state-wide HCP will provide the structure for this cooperation. HCPs have a proven record of creating tangible benefits that aid in species protection and this HCP would both protect bull trout habitat and responsible land use. For an HCP to be approved, the Secretary must find that those party to the agreement will ``to the maximum extent possible, minimize and mitigate the impacts of *.*.* taking'' of the species in question. 
   In recent hearings that I have held on HCPs in my subcommittee, numerous scientists have testified to the effectiveness of HCPs in furthering on the ground improvements to the habitat of threatened and endangered species. The funds provided for in this amendment will be used to fund data collection an organization for the States to come together and negotiate the HCP. The negotiated HCP would include state-owned endowment lands and private lands enrolled voluntarily by the landowner. To arrive at the specific terms of such an agreement, a concerted effort will be needed to accumulate data and facilitate discussions that can lead to a consensus-based solution supported by all interested parties. 
   The States of Idaho and Montana, nor the USFWS, cannot shoulder this funding burden alone. The funds provided for in this amendment are urgently needed. In addition to the overwhelming task of addressing bull trout habitat issues, the USFWS has been petitioned to list the west-slope cutthroat trout and the Yellowstone cutthroat trout. We seek, in partnership with the USFWS and the private sector, funding to develop an innovative HCP that can be a ``win'' for kids, for species, and for responsible land use.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I am introducing a very important piece of legislation, the Surface Transportation Board Improvement Act, which is aimed at correcting an injustice for railroad workers, shippers and anyone who have a contractual relationship with a railroad. Basically, my bill would end the onerous procedure of the Surface Transportation Board to override, modify, or cancel collective bargaining agreements between railroads and their employees. Collective bargaining agreements go to the very essence of the labor relations process. They are the result of hard-fought deliberations between labor and management, and of a give-and-take process which often results in no winners or losers. While the process is not perfect, collective bargaining agreements do not come lightly and they should be honored--not subject to change by a federal agency.  
   In 1920, Congress determined that railroad mergers and consolidations should be subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction through the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). To effect that intent, Congress gave an exemption from antitrust laws, other federal laws, State and municipal laws to railroads participating in a transaction approved by the ICC. However, what was good policy in 1920 no longer works today because the language used to effect that policy is too broad giving rise to unfair application. 
   Unfortunately, the exemption provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act have been extended beyond the limited area of removing inconsistent State and municipal regulations governing railroad mergers and consolidations. Instead, they now are used to override contracts between railroads and their employees and railroads and other parties, such as shippers. Since 1983, the ICC and its successor the Surface Transportation Board (STB) have used the exemption to override, modify, or cancel collective bargaining agreements between railroads and their employees. The Board has not confined these overrides, while unacceptable under any circumstances, to the period surrounding the ICC or STB approval of a transaction. If fact, the exemption has been used to modify and cancel collective bargaining agreements more than thirty years after the initial approval of the railroad consolidation. Recently, the STB has used the same exemption provisions to override contracts between shippers and railroads. This wide ranging power in a federal agency is unprecedented and needs to be remedied. 
   What we need is a balance. Contracts freely entered should be considered inviolate and subject to governmental intrusion in only the most important and rare circumstances. A railroad merger does not reach that level of importance. No one can show a legitimate present need to treat railroads any differently from other modes of transportation when it comes to their honoring contractual commitments. My bill restores a balance that existed between 1920 and 1983 by making it clear that the federal interest in regulating rail mergers and consolidations does not extend to upsetting settled contractual relationships between the regulated party, the railroads, and others. 
   The specific remedies provided by this bill are straightforward. First, the exemption is limited to inconsistent State and municipal regulations of rail mergers and consolidations. That was a primary goal of Congress in 1920 and is preserved here. The antitrust exemption is lifted because in this era of mega-rail carriers, there is no reason future railroad mergers and consolidations should not be treated the same as mergers and consolidations in other modes of transportation. Congress gave the antitrust exemption to the railroad industry in 1920 following a period of governmental control triggered, in part, because of the rail industry's general economic instability. In 1920, the federal governmental interest supported rail mergers because they seemed the key to a stable mode of transportation in an essential sector of the economy. Given the general economic health of the Class I rail carriers coupled with the recent round of mergers/acquisitions in both West and East, no one can honestly claim further railroad consolidation is necessarily in the public interest. 
   Second, my bill ends the STB's foray into labor relations. From the date of enactment, all future transactions involving the merger of work forces proposed by rail carriers under employee protective conditions previously imposed by the ICC or STB will be resolved under the dispute resolution procedures provided in the Railway Labor Act (RLA). The RLA has governed railroad labor relations since 1926 (and airlines since 1935). Congress has not amended the Act significantly since 1966 when Congress provided the means to expedite resolution of ``minor disputes'' in the industry. The manner of negotiating a change in collective bargaining agreements has been in place since 1926. While some may disagree with parts of the RLA dispute resolution process, it works and has worked for seventy-three years. My bill places resolution of force integration disputes in merger cases back into the same collective bargaining processes that govern all other changes in railroad labor relations. 
   Federal labor policy with respect to collective bargaining, as established under the RLA, is that private agreements are reached and amended by the parties without governmental compulsion. That policy provides a process whereby labor and management can voluntarily resolve differences and enter into contracts, and rejects the notion that the government should micro-manage the substantive terms of collective bargaining agreements. 
   In defiance of this policy, the STB, which has no experience or authority in collective bargaining, has routinely broken or modified privately negotiated employee contracts in the approval of mergers or other transactions. My bill bars the STB from making wholesale changes to or abrogating privately negotiated collective bargaining agreements. It is fair public policy that contracts should be saved and changed only when the parties sit down and agree to new terms in a fair collective bargaining setting.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Mr. Alan G. Lance for his election on September 9, 1999, as the National Commander of the American Legion. 
   Mr. Lance is a twenty year member of the American Legion; and, has served as the Idaho State Commander, National Executive Committeeman, and National Foreign Relations Chairman. After serving in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps Mr. Lance moved to Meridian, Idaho, established a private legal practice, and was subsequently elected to the Idaho House of Representatives. He is currently serving his second term as Attorney General for the State of Idaho and is Chairman of the Conference of Western Attorneys General. Mr. Lance is the first Idahoan to serve in the distinguished position of National Commander for this respected and influencial veterans' organization. 
   For the past eighty years the American Legion has stood tall for the rights and benefits of the men and women who have been willing to offer the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom and way of life. The American Legion is a major sponsor of the Boy Scouts of America and is a vital partner in community service with 15,000 posts worldwide. 
   Mr. Lance brings legal and legislative experience which will serve him well in advocating for the needs of the American Legion's approximately 3 million members. He is a leader and a patriot, and will be a strong leader for veterans' issues, especially health care. Idaho is proud of the new National Commander. I look forward to working with Mr. Lance in helping to keep the promises made by Congress and the nation to our deserving veterans.

   Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in the few minutes remaining, I wish to add my voice to those in opposition to this amendment. We thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his sensitivity to these issues. 
   As he correctly said, this amendment could be devastating to the people and to the families who depend on their jobs in many counties across America. I think it is important that we understand this amendment in the context in which it is being proposed. Federal timber sales are in a steep and devastating decline. Since the early 1990s, the timber program has been reduced in America by over 70 percent. Already, more than 75 percent of the National  Forest System is off limits to timber harvests. The Federal timber supply has dropped from 12 billion board feet to the 3 billion board feet being harvested today. 
   Both the economic and the ecological context created by this reduction are not desirable. More than 80,000 jobs have been lost already, and of the 55,000 jobs that remain, they will be jeopardized by this amendment. That represents over $2 billion in employment income, mostly in rural parts of America. The families who depend on those jobs are counting on us to understand this issue and to vote correctly. 
   It is confounding also that these additional cuts are being considered at a time when the industry and those working men and women who depend on it have already been deeply hurt by the critical cuts in the timber program. 
   In my home State of Idaho, our rural communities continue to suffer devastating reductions in the 25 percent funds from timber sales. Schools are going without needed renovation, and county governments are going without needed support and jeopardizing their basic services because of these steep reductions. 
   This amendment is also counterintuitive from an environmental perspective. Active forest management, including thinning and other timber harvest, has widely acknowledged benefits. In fact, most timber sales are currently designed to attain other stewardship objectives, in addition to the sales themselves. Timber sales are the most economic and efficient and effective methods available for our managers to treat and control many insect epidemics. 
   Madam President, each year the National Forest System grows by 23 billion board feet; 6 billion board feet die naturally. Only 3 billion board feet are being harvested. Tree growth in our National Forest System exceeds harvest by 600 percent. 
   I stand firmly with those who have cast their opposition today against this amendment and encourage my colleagues to reject it.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, due to the wedding of my oldest daughter, Michelle Crapo, I will be unable to participate in the debate and vote on the Conference Report for H.R. 2488, the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. Had I been present, I would have cast my vote in favor of the measure. 
   The Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999 is good news for America and will give individual income taxpayers the long-overdue tax relief they deserve. I am most pleased by the one percent across-the-board income tax cut for all individual tax rates and the marriage penalty relief provisions contained in the report. These provisions alone will go a long way towards reducing the tax burdens of the average Idaho family. 
   I am also encouraged to see that the Conference Report eliminates the estate tax, provides alternative minimum tax relief, increases the annual contribution limits for individual retirement accounts and education savings accounts, and reduces individual capital gains tax rates. 
   The Conference Report for the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999 is good for income taxpayers, the economy, and the nation. I urge my colleagues to support the report.

I think it is critical that we in America today understand that we have moved into a time of budget surplus, just what those surpluses mean, and what the opportunities are for the American people. 
   Prior to the last 3 or 4 years, we saw, I think, that most Americans became accustomed to the fact we were running very large deficits, and that the Federal Government was not able to conduct its fiscal policy in a manner that was balanced. One of the commitments I made when I ran for the House of Representatives 6 years ago was to work to try to balance the Federal budget. Fortunately, for me, and I think for all Americans, we were able to successfully achieve that objective. 
   The budget today is balanced. In fact, the projections we just heard talked about show that no matter how you look at the budget--whether you count the Social Security dollars, which I don't think should be counted, or whether you don't--we are moving into a balanced posture for the Federal Government. 
   The debate today is over what we do in a surplus posture. It is a debate that Americans have not been able to have for decades because our Government has not run surpluses. Now that we are engaged in this debate, it is critical for Americans to focus and to identify what our fiscal policy should be as we move into an era of projected surpluses. 
   In that context, I think it is critical that a few important priorities be recognized and acknowledged by the country. 
   First and foremost, I am glad we have agreement on the principle, even though we don't have agreement on the details yet, that we have to protect the Social Security trust fund surplus dollars, and make certain that what Americans pay into the Social Security system is not then taken by Congress and the President and spent on other spending by counting those surpluses against the unified budget. 
   We have a lock--in a way, a lockbox--which is now before the Senate that we have voted on six or seven times this year. We have to make sure those parts of the surplus remain dedicated to the Social Security trust fund. With the remainder of what I call the true budget, the onbudget surplus, we have to decide as a country on what we are going to focus. 
   Over the next 10 years, we will have a surplus somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 trillion. You have heard different numbers discussed today. I think it is important that we not 
   continue the path of growing the Federal Government, expanding the spending posture of the Federal Government, and spending those surplus dollars. If we do so, we will find a time in the near future when we will not be able to maintain surpluses in our budget; we will return to deficits, and we will see the national debt continue to rise. 
   As a result of that, I think it is critical we focus on two high priorities. One is to reduce the national debt. Although we have balanced the Federal budget, we haven't reduced the national debt to zero. That should be one of our highest priorities. Two is to make sure that we return to the American people a tax cut. 
   The American people recognize that this is an opportunity. It is an opportunity that we may not have too many times as we work through these difficult budget times to achieve tax relief. But to use, as the Senator from New Mexico indicated, just one quarter of this total surplus picture for tax relief I think is an appropriate commitment. 
   That leaves us the opportunity to provide resources to parts of our Federal obligation that need strengthening. It gives us and the American people the opportunity to strengthen and to stabilize the Social Security trust fund. It is a sound policy. 
   I think America should begin to focus on this debate as Congress works its way into a very important new era: How do we deal with budget surpluses?

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about the question that we will vote on at 5:30; namely, will we restore the meaning of rule XVI? 
   Over the last 2 or 3 months, there has been a lot of debate and discussion among us in the Senate on this issue. One part of that debate has been that it was the Republicans who changed the rule by voting to override it a couple of years ago. The Democrats at that time voted not to override it.  
   Today, you have the anomaly on the floor where the Republicans are saying let's restore that rule because it was a mistake to override it, and the minority is saying we don't want to restore that rule because it is something that we are able to use as a tool in the current climate. 
   I wasn't here 2 years ago. I am in the seventh month of my first year in the Senate. I wasn't a part of that debate. But I can go back to 7 years ago now when I ran for Congress. I ran for the House of Representatives. One of the things I said then was that I thought a problem in our system in Washington was the fact that amendments were being put forward by Members of the House and the Senate--Republican and Democrat--that were not related to that legislation. 
   I come from Idaho. In the Idaho Legislature, that is not allowed. You can't offer an amendment to a bill that doesn't relate to the bill on which you are working. I think that is probably the way it is in most State legislatures. It is the way the Senate rules require that we operate. 
   I think one of the other Senators who was debating it earlier in the day indicated that these are not new rules we are 
   fighting over now in this rather partisan era of politics. The genesis of this approach was way back in, I think, 1868 in one of the earlier predecessors to this rule XVI, when it was recognized by the Members of the Senate that proper legislative protocol was that the bill on the floor should be amended by amendments that were related only to that bill. 
   Why would we have a big debate over that concept? 
   When I was running for office 6 years ago, I thought there was a pretty strong national understanding that one of the problems we were facing in the Federal Government was the fact that legislation was proliferating, spending was proliferating, and there seemed to be no way to bring it under control. Part of the problem was all of the nongermane or unrelated legislation that was being tacked on as riders to legislation that was moving through. Legislation that wouldn't necessarily have the ability to move on its own was being attached to a vehicle that was moving through, and then that vehicle would carry it through to success and enactment into law. 
   I believe that is wrong legislating. That is the wrong policy under which we should legislate. I think it results in bad policy decisions being worked into law because they are attached to something else that has the ability to carry them over the finish line when they themselves don't have the merit to be enacted. 
   I believe that is why in 1868 the Senate proposed the predecessor to this rule that would start the Senate down the road of having a protocol that you could not put amendments on legislation that was not relevant to that legislation. 
   What does rule XVI say? What does the rule we are fighting over say? 
   Sometimes people say to me these procedural issues are arcane and you shouldn't spend so much time worrying about them. But, frankly, I think it is critical. There is an issue that is important to this institution, and it is important to America. It has a very big impact on the kinds of policy decisions that this Nation will make. 
   What does the rule we are fighting over say? It says:  
   On a point of order made by any Senator, no amendment offered by any other Senator which proposes general legislation shall be received to any general appropriations bill, nor shall any amendment not germane or relevant to the subject matter contained in the bill be received, nor shall any amendment to any item or clause of such bill be received which does not directly relate thereto.  
   That is a sensible statement of what the policy should be. This rule says as to appropriations bills--I think that we should have it be that way with regard to all bills--an amendment that doesn't relate to that bill is not in order. 
   That is the issue we are debating today. 
   I was on the floor earlier when several of my colleagues from the other side gave very strong and impassioned arguments as to why they are going to vote against this legislation. 
   Actually, as Senator GRAMM from Texas indicated, after listening to those same arguments, I found very little that I disagreed with in their debate about what they believe should be the protocol of the Senate and what they believe should be our attitude toward this great institution of government. 
   The argument that seems to be made is that because we are not able to get all of our agenda put forward on the bills that we want to see put forward, we need the opportunity to bring nongermane amendments to appropriations bills. It was said that the opportunity to bring their issues forward was not being allowed to them. 
   I agree that they should have that opportunity, although I find it a little difficult to see that they are not having it. 
   I remember 2 or 3 weeks ago when this issue came to a point when we were debating the agriculture appropriations bill. 
   An amendment related to health care was brought and debated on the floor of this Senate with regard to the agriculture appropriations bill. At the time, what happened? We had a lot of debate about whether we should be debating health care on an agriculture bill. Ultimately we reached a resolution by which we took the agriculture appropriations bill off the floor, came back a week or so later, and brought the health care legislation to the floor, had a full week of debate on the health care issue, and finally a vote on that health care issue. 
   To me, the question of whether the legislation is moving forward or the issues the minority wants to see brought forward can be brought forward is one that has to be focused on closely. In the Senate--and the good Senator from West Virginia very well and very carefully explained the difference between the House and the Senate--in the Senate, as compared to the House, the minority rights do give the minority many powerful opportunities to bring forth their legislation and their ideas, not the least of which are the filibuster, the hold, and any number of other procedural opportunities they may have. I am convinced the minority's rights to bring forward their issues for argument are well protected. I would say to the Senators who are concerned about that, I agree with them, they should be protected. 
   The way a legislature should operate is that both sides should be able to bring forward their issues and the clash of ideas should take place on the floor of the Senate. The Senate should then vote based on principle, on what the policy of the country should be on the issue being debated. 
   What should not happen is that, as an important bill that is moving forward is being debated, something that cannot survive the clash of ideas gets attached to it as a rider and then slides through into law without that opportunity for the clear and concise focus that would be followed if rule XVI were followed. 
   Although we are debating a procedural issue today, the issue could not be more important to the governance of this Senate and to the governance of this country. I do not remember who it was, but one of the great political leaders of the country once said: If you give me control over the procedure, I can control the outcome. Procedures are critical to the proper outcome in a legislative body. I agree wholeheartedly with my colleagues; our procedures must be fair; they must be balanced. In that context, I would willingly support any efforts to make the system here more fair and more balanced. 
   I look at this not as a Republican or a Democrat. As I said, I was not here 2 years ago when the fight took place to change the rule from what it was before. I believe Republicans and Democrats break the spirit of this rule regularly in the Senate. To me, we have to look at what is the right principle by which this great institution should be governed. When we identify the principle by which we should be governed, without partisan considerations, we should enact that principle into our rules. That is what I believe was done in 1868. I think that is what the Senate has done historically with what is now rule XVI and with the principle that we should not allow nongermane riders to be attached to legislation being considered on the floor of the Senate. 
   I would like to conclude my remarks by going back to a theme that has been brought up by the Senator from West Virginia, and that is his respect for this great institution. It is one of the  greatest honors that ever could be bestowed on anyone to have the privilege to serve in this Chamber, the Senate. I feel about my opportunity that deeply. I want to do nothing other than to make this institution the great institution our Founding Fathers intended for it to be. It will be that kind of institution if we look beyond partisanship, beyond politics, and beyond personal attacks, and identify the principles by which we should govern ourselves, put those principles into place, and then operate within their limits. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to bring to the attention of my colleagues a significant achievement in the field of environmental science. 
   Lockheed Martin Corporation annually recognizes 50 of its 170,000 employees with NOVA awards for technical excellence. Mr. Robert W. Smith of Lockheed Martin Idaho Technologies Company, the operating contractor of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, INEEL, was cited for his valuable work in utilizing microbial communities in the subsurface to contribute to the remediation of contaminants resulting from nuclear energy and weapons research. 
   Mr. Smith heads teams comprised of scientists from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Princeton University, and Portland State University. They represent the best in field scale research of biogeochemistry processes. The natural processes that Mr. Smith and his teams uncover will be incorporated into future efforts to clean up the legacy of waste from the nuclear energy complex and contamination problems on other agency lands. Mr. Smith expects that instead of massive engineering solutions to remove the waste, natural processes that cause less environmental disturbance will be more commonly utilized. 
   I congratulate Mr. Smith on receiving this award. The achievement also recognizes that his success could not have been made without the dedication of his team members. There are an array of environmental stewardship and natural resource problems ranging from mining reclamation to global climate impacts that could be solved through collaborative research. Objective science and reasonable solutions would then be available for policy makers, agency executives, and advocate groups involved in critical natural resource issues. More can be accomplished when parties work together to solve problems than through conflict. I urge each of my colleagues to keep these concepts in mind as we debate and consider investing in basic science, research, and the environment.

   Mr. CRAPO. Yes, I would, very much. Mr. President, this is something that I haven't said to the majority leader, but 6 years ago I ran for the House of Representatives. In that campaign, I said that one of the things I thought ought to be fixed in Congress was that we should stop Congress from considering legislation with amendments that have nothing to do with the underlying bill. I used to say they should not be allowed to put nongermane amendments on legislation. I was told that maybe that is too big a word, ``nongermane.'' 
   I think the American people understand that concept. In fact, the American people understand that one of the problems we face in Congress--both the House and the Senate--is that when a piece of legislation is considered, we don't keep it germane: we don't keep the focus of the debate on that legislation. Americans understand that is why we run into budget problems. 
   They understand that is why we have so many difficult problems in Congress. They can't understand why we can't come to agreement. The fact is that it is a very sensible commonsense principle that used to be in the rules of the Senate--that when a piece of legislation was brought before the Senate, an amendment cannot be put on that legislation unless the amendment is germane or relevant to that legislation itself. It is something that all Americans have an easy time understanding. Yet for some reason we have a difficult time here in the Senate honoring that basic principle. 
   This isn't an issue of who is right on this issue or who is right on that issue or who is going to get political advantage out of this rule. It is a rule that cuts the same way all the time, and whichever party or whichever interest would like to abuse it is the one that is going to have to face its consequences. But it is one which is a fair principle that will allow us to properly move forward. 
   I think it is very critical to recognize that today we are debating this issue because we are trying to finish the appropriations process, and not run into a problem a few months from now when we are not able to get the Government's budgeting process finished, to keep our commitment to the American people to keep a balanced budget, and maybe eke out an opportunity for some tax relief and yet fulfill our responsibilities to the important programs in the Federal Government.  
   That is the debate today. Part of that debate we are on today is the agriculture appropriations bill. Yet we have stopped the functions of the Senate now for several days, and the threat apparently is permanently, unless we shift the debate to another very important topic--the health care issue. 
   No one disagrees that we should debate health care issues. We even offered that we can debate those issues. The offer simply has been let's do it in an orderly and a principled way. Let's not allow amendments that are unrelated to the subject of the underlying legislation to be submitted. 
   I think it is very interesting that the argument was made just a minute ago that, well, you Republicans changed this rule a few years ago. I didn't. I wasn't here a few years ago when that vote was taken. I was campaigning 6 years ago, so that shouldn't be the way this Senate should operate, and it shouldn't be the way the House of Representatives operates. I have taken that position every session that I have been in this Congress. I take that position here today. We have to take the strong position on principles. 
   I think the American people will recognize that, and they know a lot of politics is being played as we debate here today. But if we will make our decisions on principles by which the American people should be governed, and by which this House of our Congress should be governed, and then let those principles work their way out as the various interests try to play politics on the issues, then at least we will know that the process is fair. That is what this Senate ought to do and what it ought to return to. 
   I think it is time for us to resolve this impasse by returning to the kind of governing principles that we should follow as a Senate. 
   I thank the majority leader for yielding and giving me this opportunity.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, my amendment is co-sponsored by the Senate Majority Leader, Senator LOTT. On February 23, 1999, the Senate voted 87 to 11 in favor of this same amendment during consideration of S. 4. 
   My amendment will repeal the current statute that reduces retirement pay for regular officers of a uniformed service who chose to work for the federal government. 
   The uniformed services include the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency. 
   If a retired officer from the uniform services comes to work for the Senate, his or her retirement pay is reduced by about 50 percent, after the first $8,000, to offset for payments from the Senate. 
   The retired officer can request a waiver but the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government handle the waiver process differently on a case by case basis. 
   The current dual compensation limitation is also discriminatory in that regular officers are covered but reservists or enlisted personnel are not covered by the limitation. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has recently looked at the current dual compensation limitation and it is estimated that around 6,000 military retirees lose an average of $800 per month because of this prohibition. 
   I have been unable to find one good reason to explain why we should want our law to discourage retired members of the uniformed services from seeking full time employment with the Federal Government. 
   Our laws should not reduce a benefit military retirees have earned because they chose to work for the federal government. 
   My amendment would fix this inequity, it would give retired officers equal pay for equal work from the federal government and it would give the federal government access to a workforce that currently avoids employment with the Federal Government. 
   I am pleased the managers of the bill have agreed to accept my amendment and I thank them for their support for this important amendment.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the ``Pharmacist's Patient Protection Act of 1999.'' The purpose of the legislation is to stop the implementation of final regulations that have been issued by the Food and Drug Administration that will require community pharmacists to provide agency sanctioned information when certain prescription drugs are dispensed to a patient. Such regulations, commonly called ``MedGuides'', were issued in final form on December 1, 1998. 
   Now why would Congress want to prohibit a regulation which would give patients written information about their medications? The answer is very simple. During the 104th Congress, the House and Senate debated this very same issue, and ultimately a compromise was reached whereby FDA agreed not to promulgate its MedGuide regulations for a period of time so that the private sector would have the opportunity to work with the Administration to develop a voluntary action plan to continue to increase the quality and quantity of written information already being provided to consumers with prescription medication. Under the agreement which was enacted into law as part of the FY 97 Agriculture Appropriations, FDA is prohibited from implementing any part of the MedGuide regulations until the year 2001. When we get to the year 2001, FDA would be permitted to move forward with the MedGuide initiative only if voluntary efforts failed to get written information to 75 percent of all patients receiving a new prescription. 
   Regrettably, FDA has chosen not to live up to its part of the agreement. The agency's final rule to require Medication Guides for selected prescription drugs, which will take effect on June 1, 1999, is in clear violation of federal law. It appears that FDA is deliberately ignoring the law. It would be my hope that the Administration would hold in abeyance the implementation of the MedGuide regulations, and honor the remainder of the moratorium relating to this rule making. However, I am not confident that this will occur, and therefore this bill is necessary so that we can put back into place the terms of the agreement that were made with the Administration during the 104th Congress. 
   Finally, I should point out that holding off the implementation of the MedGuide rule will not deny patients access to prescription drug information, nor will it preclude FDA from communicating with pharmaceutical companies and community pharmacists about the importance of providing information to patients about their prescription drugs. In other words, nothing in this bill should be construed as restricting the ability of the FDA to use its existing authority regarding the provision of written patient information on a product-by-product basis with certain prescription medications. 
   Let the competitive retail pharmacy marketplace continue to make great strides in providing consumers with meaningful, accurate and easily understood written information about prescription drugs. I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor the ``Pharmacist's Patient Protection Act of 1999.''

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Environmental Stewardship and Natural Resources Act which I am introducing today with Senator CRAIG as cosponsor. 
   The nuclear defense capability of the United States has protected our form of government and ensured our freedoms since its inception during World War II. In order to sustain and develop our nuclear deterrence, a vast industrial complex was established. This complex of facilities was built under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Commission and its successor agency, the Department of Energy. Uranium mines, factories, laboratories, and reactors were located throughout the country to provide nuclear and conventional components for weapons. These facilities were mostly located on large tracts of land, which also included surrounding buffer areas for security. 
   With the end of the cold war, and the mutual reduction of the United States and Russian nuclear arsenals, many of our nuclear facilities are closing, changing or reducing their missions. Land management at these facilities, throughout their production lives was limited to accomplishing their missions and providing isolation and security. Protection of the ecosystems and natural resources, on which our nuclear arsenal was built, did not rate high priority in the agency's planning. Any environmental benefits or natural resources protection on these facilities was truly incidental to their isolation. 
   In addition to lack of natural resource planning, there exists a contamination legacy which has resulted in the largest and most expensive cleanup program in the federal government. Regardless of the effectiveness and efficiency of the cleanup program, some levels of contaminants will remain, and will need to be monitored and managed. Long term stewardship is the process of managing and protecting the natural resources that are unaffected by contamination, and also the continual monitoring and stabilization of contaminants that remain in place following mediation. Even after a  facility is cleaned up and closed, no matter how effective the remediation effort, the federal government is still liable for any subsequent action that may be necessary to insure that no harm will come to humans or the environment. 
   The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, INEEL, has a long history with the Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Energy. Originally known as the National Reactor Testing Station, this site constructed, tested, and operated 52 reactors for various defense and civilian purposes since the early 1950's. All but a handful of these reactors have been decontaminated and dismantled. In addition to this nuclear mission, the INEEL has developed expertise and experience in the modeling the movement of contaminants in the environment; and research and development of technologies necessary for the detection, monitoring, stabilization, and mediation of contamination. I propose, with this bill, to establsh the INEEL as the Department of Energy Center of Excellence for the development of technologies, techniques, and methodologies for the implementation of an effective Long Term Stewardship program throughout the nuclear weapons production complex. 
   I also propose the establishment of a Natural Resource Institute at the INEEL. This institute will bring together scientists, scholars, and others in the field of natural resources management, to study complex issues that affect natural resources policy. The institute will also work on specific natural resource and environmental issues and problems, by utilizing the resources of the INEEL, northwest universities, states, and various federal agencies. The INEEL is a national laboratory, not is just a laboratory for the Department of Energy. The expertise, experience, and resources of this site must be made available to all. The natural Resource Institute will be the conduit for bringing expertise to the INEEL and for making information, data, and good science available for the solution of natural resource issues throughout the inland northwest.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Alternative Fuels Promotion Act, which is introduced today by Senators ROCKEFELLER, HATCH, BRYAN, and myself. 
   There are many reasons for my support of the Alternative Fuels Promotion Act offered today, in the Senate. A number of those reasons may not be immediately evident, given that the merits of alternative fuels are most often spoken in terms of environmental protection. While there are significant environmental benefits that can be gained from this bill, there are also benefits to be obtained in national security, promotion of the domestic oil industry, the encouragement of business development and innovation, and increased options for the consumer. 
   Over half of the oil consumed in the United States is produced overseas. Internal combustion vehicles, cars, and trucks, are the primary market for this cheap and readily available source of energy. We, as a nation, have become complacent in our assumption that this stream of easily obtainable fuel will flow forever. It is time for this assumption to be challenged. Most of us have viewed this as simply an economic issue: buy what is cheapest and most available. However, this source of fuel is vulnerable to interruption by foreign governments through changing attitudes toward the U.S., foreign policy or military conflict. The United States should take positive and sure steps toward developing domestically available alternative sources of fuel in order that our economy and accustomed way of life cannot be threatened by the whims and troubles of those outside of our borders. 
   The flood of foreign oil into the U.S. has left the domestic oil industry fighting for its life. Our support for alternative fueled vehicles should not be interpreted as a challenge or competition to the domestic oil industry. In direct contrast, it recognizes the importance of that industry of our national security. Petroleum products and fuels, including gasoline, will be needed far into the future for the transportation requirements of individuals, mass transportation, and conveyance of goods. The development of alternative fuels that are plentiful in this country, in conjunction with support for our domestic oil industry, will provide us a level of economic national security that we have not experienced for most of this century. By our efforts to revive the U.S. oil industry and the development of alternative fuels and vehicles, we will not be held hostage by foreign governments in gas lines again. 
   The number of innovative alternative fuel technologies is encouraging. This bill supports the further development of vehicles that are powered by electricity, fuel cells, methanol, and various forms of natural gas. Tax incentives are already in place for other technologies such as ethanol. Support for all promising alternative fuels is warranted in order to give consumers options for choosing those vehicles that will best serve their needs; whether a company requires a fleet of natural gas powered buses to transport their employees of work sites, or an individual's preference for an electric vehicle for in-town use to commute to work or run errands. 
   The enactment of tax incentives for emerging technologies is the logical way to encourage the development of cost effective alternative fueled vehicles, without the federal government mandating a preference. Leveling the tax incentive playing field within the alternative fuel energy sector will encourage partnerships between traditional providers of transportation and fuel products, and new companies with promising innovations. Instead of fighting change, traditional industry providers will participate in it and benefit from it. Increased market demand for alternative fuel vehicle technologies will also provide an opportunity and an incentive for the federal government to place greater emphasis on research and development in this industry sector. The results of which can then be leveraged into the private market. 
   While the environmental benefits of cleaner burning fuels are often the most talked about and often the most evident; we should not discount the benefits that can be gained by developing our nation's energy independence.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I want to personally thank you for arranging for us to take this time out of our busy schedules to recognize teachers during Teacher Appreciation Week. 
   Providing the brightest future for our nation's children is one of the most important things we will do here on the floor of the Senate. After parents and families, America's teachers play the leading role in helping our children reach their potential. Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to join in tribute to our nation's outstanding educators and recognize a few of the top teachers in my home state of Idaho. 
   We all know the impact of teachers. Five days a week, for 9 months of every year, nearly 3 million teachers in this country help mold our children's future. I believe in the quality education our teachers, administrators, and others provide in Idaho. That is why my children continue to reside in the great State of Idaho. My wife Susan and I made the decision nearly 7 years ago when I was first elected to Congress that she and our children would remain in Idaho. We wanted our children to continue to receive the quality education they now experience in Idaho's public school system. 
   That quality education takes many faces. I want to show you one of them this morning. Judy Bieze lives in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and teaches first grade at Hayden Meadows Elementary in nearby Hayden Lake. 
   Mrs. Bieze was honored this year by the State of Idaho as Teacher of the Year. But she is more than that; she is also a local softball coach and a Sunday school teacher, so I guess that makes her a teacher 7 days a week. 
   During each school year Mrs. Bieze gives individual attention to her students by profiling each one as the ``Special and Unique'' person of the week. She also encourages parents to volunteer in the classroom and to take an active role in their child's learning. 
   It is the ability to give of herself that makes Mrs. Bieze special. Her superintendent says she ``exemplifies the initiative and dedication we seek in our educators.'' Mrs. Bieze characteristically deflects that praise and credits her students. She says she--in her words--is ``truly blessed'' as ``the recipient of their unrestrained love, curiosity and enthusiasm for six hours each day.'' If only we could be holding more speeches on the floor of this Senate that deal with issues like love, curiosity and enthusiasm. Mrs. Bieze, we salute you. 
   I would be remiss in not mentioning some of Idaho's other outstanding teachers. Just last week, Idaho's PTA honored Jeff Durner, a fifth-grade teacher at Jefferson Elementary in Boise. The PTA credits Mr. Durner for helping children ``become the best they can be.'' 
   The Idaho Education Association credits a sixth-grade teacher from my hometown of Idaho Falls as being worthy of special recognition. Zoe Ann Jorgenson has helped develop a special program in her district that groups children based on their needs, not on their age. She says many parents have chosen to keep their children in public schools, rather than move them to private classrooms, based on this innovative and unique program. 
   Mrs. Jorgenson believes the system should be made to fit the children, not that children be forced to fit the system. She says that parents are looking for choices within the structure of the public school system, and she wants to offer them those choices. 
   Finally, Idaho Parents Unlimited says a special education teacher formerly from Blackfoot, and now from Meridian, ID deserves credit for trail-blazing programs for students that are sometimes forgotten in our school systems. 
   Barbara Jones earned the title of Special Education Consulting Teacher. One parent in Blackfoot described her as ``a true gift to my son as well as myself.'' Ms. Jones is now helping both fellow teachers and students learn how special needs can offer special rewards. 
   We all have a stake in this process, because our children's success in education depends on the support they receive at home, and the future of our nation depends on the leaders we are raising today. 
   Some define leadership as what we do with our opportunities. I am proud to praise these fine Idaho educators who have moved the bar higher--for our children.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend, Senator ABRAHAM of Michigan, in offering this amendment. 
   This amendment is being offered in reaction to a provision in the President's FY 2000 budget that would impose a new tax on the investment income of nonprofit trade and professional associations. These trade and professional associations are currently exempt from taxes under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
   The administration's proposal would tax the investment income--interest,  dividends, capital gains, rents, and royalties--of 501(c)(6) associations. Associations currently rely on this investment income to carry out exempt-status related activities such as education, training, standard-setting, research, and community outreach. 
   Under the President's proposal, the first $10,000 an association earns from investments would not be taxed. However, all income earned over $10,000 would be subject to the unrelated business income tax under the Internal Revenue Code. It is estimated that this new tax, which can be as high as 35 percent, will increase the tax burden on the nation's nonprofit trade and professional associations by $1.4 billion over the next 5 years. 
   Contrary to assertions made by the administration, this proposal will affect thousands of small and mid-sized trade associations and professional societies. According to the American Society of Association Executives' Operating Ratio Report, most associations with annual operating budgets as low as $200,000 would be subject to a new tax under this proposal. 
   As many as 70,000 associations nationwide could be affected by this new tax, including the American Youth Soccer Organization, American Nurses Association, the National Education Association, National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, and many others. Important trade associations in my home state that could be affected by the new tax include the Idaho Association of School Administrators, Idaho Credit Union League, Idaho Mining Association, the Idaho Cattle Association and others. 
   This amendment is supported by the American Society of Association Executives (ASAE), the trade organization that represents our Nation's trade and professional associations. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this new tax and support the amendment.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to present this important amendment. 
   As we said yesterday when we discussed this amendment preliminarily, we have had an opportunity for the last 4 or 5 years to debate the concept of a lockbox in one context or another. Originally, in the House of Representatives when we presented this idea, it was to address deficits. We have had deficits for as long as most of us can remember. Yet the budget process did not seem to provide a mechanism by which we could lock aside spending that Congress decided to reduce in order to make sure that it was used to reduce the debt, or to reduce the deficit. Now we are in a surplus environment. We have just done some major work on this budget that was spearheaded by Senator ABRAHAM and Senator DOMENICI to create a lockbox for the Social Security surpluses, and to assure those surpluses are not spent by Congress. They are locked aside to be utilized to either pay down the public debt, or to be used to reform Social Security, both of which will strengthen and save a lot of the Social Security trust fund. 
   I commend our chairman for that tremendous effort and will support that effort. This amendment which Senator GRAMS from Minnesota and I have worked on would use the lockbox concept for another part of the surplus, that part of the surplus that deals with the potential for an increased surplus beyond that which we now have projected. 
   In July, we expect that new projections will show an increased surplus outside of the Social Security surplus that will be generated by taxpayer dollars. This part of the surplus will be a surplus that was not contemplated by Congress as we put together this budget. We are putting together this budget based on our current projections. And this budget will take care of the Social Security surplus. It will protect Medicare and education and other needed spending and will find room for tax relief. But, if in July the new projections show an enhanced surplus, this amendment would say that any new surplus must be locked away in a lockbox so that it can be used only for tax relief or retirement of the national debt. 
   It is critical that we take the tough steps, but the important steps to assure that as we now move into a surplus environment with our budget that we protect the taxpayer and we protect those of particularly our younger generations who face such monumental debt in our Federal Government. 
   This amendment says any new enhanced surplus that comes from better projections that is in excess of what we are projecting in this budget that we are working on now will not be used for other spending, but will be used to reduce the burden of taxes on Americans, or to reduce the national debt, which has been incurred over the last few decades. 
   I strongly encourage the adoption of this amendment.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, this amendment is a very straightforward amendment. It seeks to deal with the excess surplus we expect to be projected this July. We are now working on a budget that will be saving Social Security, for tax relief, and for the necessary investments we must make in our military, education, Medicare, and other needed programs the Federal Government must pay attention to. 
   After this budget is put together and we have made those adjustments, we expect the July reports will say we have an even larger surplus than is now expected. 
   This amendment says, if a larger surplus develops, that surplus should be set aside in a lockbox for either tax relief or debt retirement. It is very straightforward, to say after we have met the needs in negotiating this budget, we then apply any future increases in the surplus to debt retirement or tax relief.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today as an original co-sponsor of the National Monument Public Participation Act of 1999. I commend my colleague, Senator CRAIG, for bringing forward this important measure and am pleased to offer it my support. 
   The National Monument Public Participation Act of 1999 will establish guidelines for public and local, State, and federal government involvement in the designation and planning of national monuments. Currently, under the 1906 Antiquities Act, the President has the authority to proclaim a national monument and determine its composition and scope without any prior or subsequent public involvement. Although this authority has rarely been invoked since the implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which mandates public comment periods prior to federal land management actions, the recent exercise of this authority by the current Administration has called attention to the need to revise the Antiquities Act. These proposed amendments to the Antiquities Act reflect the contemporary recognition that public involvement in federal land management decisions is both proper and beneficial. 
   This measure, beyond requiring the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to include the public and the different levels of government in the decision to designate and form national monuments, also directs the Secretaries to research and make available information about the land to be designated. Factors such as the mineral values present and identification of existing rights held on federal lands within the area to be designated have an obvious bearing on the decision of whether designation is appropriate and, if it is, how it should be structured. An understanding of these factors should be a part of an inclusive decision-making process and, hence, it is appropriate to require that they be explored and publicly shared prior to the designation of a national monument. 
   The strongest protection, however, that the National Monument Public Participation Act of 1999 provides for public oversight of national monument designation is the requirement that any recommendation of the President for declaration of land as a national monument shall become effective only if so provided by an Act of Congress. By subjecting proposals for monument designations to congressional approval, this Act ensures that when national monuments are established they are truly supported, both nationally and by local communities. This Act provides an important level of protection for public involvement in land use issues and I am pleased to offer it my support.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friends, Senators ABRAHAM, DOMENICI, and ASHCROFT, in supporting this amendment. I appreciate the courtesy allowing me to make these remarks before we set the amendment aside. 
   I particularly thank Senator DOMENICI for putting together a well-crafted budget that achieves the important principles of protecting Social Security, paying down the debt, and staying within the budget caps. 
   I have a very specific interest in the lockbox legislation that is being proposed, because over the last 6 years as I served in the House of Representatives, I advocated a lockbox concept which was, at that time, focused on taking the spending we save through budget battles and locking it away for paying down the national debt or reducing the deficit at that point in time, rather than allowing it to be spent on further Federal spending. 
   This lockbox legislation which I worked on in the House for the last 5 or 6 years passed the House four times, never to make it through the Senate or signed into law. So it is particularly pleasing to me to see the concept now being used as we move into a surplus environment in our budget process to allow us to lock away the Social Security surpluses and make sure that Congress does not continue the practices of the past in spending those surpluses on other Federal spending. 
   This amendment which is being discussed in this proposal recommends locking the Social Security surpluses by requiring that they are to be used to pay down the public debt, rather than allowing Congress to continue to spend those funds elsewhere. It is no different from what should happen under current practices when the entire Government runs a total surplus, but there is no mechanism to lock these funds away and prevent Congress from spending them. 
   Social Security surpluses help to pay for the rest of Government when it runs a deficit. Starting in 2001, it is expected that the Federal Government will run surpluses in the rest of the Government and will not rely on Social Security surpluses. 
   The amendment recommends establishing a declining limit on the level of debt held by the public. These limits would decline in 2-year intervals by the amount equal to the Social Security trust fund surpluses for those years, and those declining limits would dedicate Social Security surpluses to reducing the public debt, thereby not only reducing our debt but strengthening and stabilizing the Social Security trust funds at the same time. 
   The amendment also recommends establishing a 60-vote point 
   of order  against any legislation which results in the public debt limits specified in the law being exceeded. 
   This amendment reaffirms the off-budget treatment of Social Security and prohibits the inclusion of Social Security funds in budget totals. 
   A point I think that needs to be made is this: Today, across America, you hear many, many people calling for us to strengthen and protect Social Security. There are lots of different ideas being discussed about how we should accomplish that, but this proposed amendment does what everyone else is talking about. It makes it absolutely clear that those Social Security trust fund dollars will be set aside, they will be locked up, so they can be used for nothing other than reducing the public debt or funding a Social Security reform piece of legislation. 
   I do not see how anyone who professes to support stabilizing and strengthening our Social Security system cannot support this amendment. It is time we put into effect a lockbox mechanism to assure that neither this Congress, nor future Congresses, can take the Social Security trust funds and use them for any purposes other than that for which they were intended. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased tonight to join with my good friend, Senator GRAMS of Minnesota, in offering an amendment that will help provide taxpayers relief from their tax obligations, as well as debt reduction for the American people. 
   Back when Senator GRAMS and I both served in the House of Representatives together and, I might add, at the same time we served with you, Mr. President, in the House of Representatives, we noticed a very interesting peculiarity in the budget process: When the House or the Senate reduced spending or adjusted spending downward in the budget, all that really happened was those particular projects or programs were eliminated or reduced, but the spending never was reduced and the deficits that we were dealing with at that time never really was reduced. 
   The deficit spending did not end. All that happened was that through some very intricate budget processes, those reductions in spending got reallocated to other spending proposals. 
   So we came up with an idea back then called the lockbox. We passed it four times in the House of Representatives as an effort to try to make sure that when the House or the Senate reduced spending, that reduced spending went to reduce the deficit and was not slid over into or moved over into other spending. 
   Now we have reached a point at which we have actually ended the deficits that we were working on 4 or 5 years ago, and we are dealing with surpluses. But the lockbox concept has gained significant support and is now proving to be a very valuable tool in dealing with the budget in a surplus climate. 
   Today, we have already adopted a very important lockbox amendment relating to Social Security. It was offered by a number of Senators. The primary sponsor was Senator ABRAHAM. That amendment provided that Social Security surpluses would be locked away in a lockbox and would not be allowed to be spent by Congress on other spending, in essence. That was an important first step. 
   We are now debating many different aspects of a very important budget. There is a debate as to what to do with the Social Security surplus and, as I indicated, we made a big step today in locking up that surplus so that it does not get squandered by Congress in other areas. That will stabilize and strengthen the Social Security trust funds. 
   As you know, the debate today, tomorrow, and probably the rest of the week, will show there is a debate underway on whether to reduce the national debt or to engage in significant tax relief for the American people or whether to allocate some of the surplus to those needed and important areas, such as our national defense or education or Medicare and other areas of needed concern. 
   But among that debate, Senator GRAMS and I believe that it is very important that we focus on what is going to happen with the surpluses in the future. 
   Senator DOMENICI has shown courage in producing a budget that is going to protect Social Security, it is going to pay down the public debt, it is going to stay within the budget caps, and it is going to provide an opportunity for needed critical tax relief. But on July 15, 1999, the Congressional Budget Office is going to update its economic and budget forecast for the fiscal year 2000 and beyond. 
   It is our expectation that this report will forecast an onbudget surplus that is even in excess of the current CBO estimates. If this is true and if that develops and we see even larger surpluses than we are now expecting, and after we have now put together a budget that allocates it as we think proper among tax relief, debt retirement,  needed spending on the items that I have indicated and protection of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and if we still see a growing surplus, we believe that this unanticipated surplus should be set aside, should be put into another lockbox and be authorized to be used for only further tax relief or further debt retirement. 
   Our amendment will create a lockbox, a reserve fund in addition to the non-Social Security surpluses so that we lock in the additional non-Social Security surpluses, and in the outyears 2001 through 2009, those additional unexpected surpluses that are non-Social Security surpluses would then be made available to be taken from this lockbox only for tax relief or debt retirement. 
   These excess surpluses could then benefit the American people in the best way possible and would then be protected from further raiding by Congress for big spending. These unanticipated surpluses could not be used for other types of proposals, and it would guarantee the American people that we would see the retirement of debt or the increase of tax relief as they have been asking for. We have had some other speeches recently on the floor tonight about the critical importance of recognizing the national debt that has grown over the last little while. 
   The Senator from Ohio talked about his grandchildren, and all of us have talked about the fact that our children and our grandchildren are today being expected to pay the debt that we have grown over the last few decades. That is wrong. This bill will help assure that these unanticipated surpluses, if they develop, will be utilized for that debt retirement. 
   What about the current quality of life? With the tax rates now the highest they have been in a peacetime circumstance in America, the only time tax rates have ever been higher in America is during war. We are now siphoning off from the economy so much for the excessive Federal spending that we are jeopardizing the current quality of life of our children and our grandchildren because their families have to pay such heavy and excessive tax burdens. 
   It is these two key problems--the excessive taxes and the excessive debt rate that we have in this country--to which we should dedicate these unanticipated surpluses. Taxes are still too high and still too cumbersome and still impact America's working families too heavily. I urge all our colleagues to support this needed and valuable amendment. It would utilize the critical lockbox concept to put into place one more parameter on our budget negotiations this year to assure if our economy does stay strong and we see those surpluses in the future we do not now anticipate, that we can set them aside for retirement of our national debt and reduction of the tax burden on all Americans. 
   I yield the floor at this time to my good colleague from Minnesota, because I know he is here and would like to speak further on this issue.

    Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the State Water Sovereignty Protection Act, a bill to preserve the authority of the States over waters within their boundaries, to delegate the authority of the Congress to the States to regulate water, and for other purposes. 
   Since 1866, Congress has recognized and deferred to the States the authority to allocate and administer water within their borders. The Supreme Court has confirmed that this is an appropriate role for the States. Additionally, in 1952, the Congress passed the McCarran amendment which provides for the adjudication of State and Federal Water claims in State water courts. 
   However, despite both judicial and legislative edicts, I am deeply concerned that the administration, Federal agencies, and some in the Congress are setting the stage for ignoring long established statutory provisions concerning State water rights and State water contracts. The Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, the Federal Land Policy Management Act, and wilderness designations have all been vehicles used to erode State sovereignty over its water. 
   It is imperative that States maintain sovereignty over management and control of their water and river systems. All rights to water or reservations of rights for any purposes in States should be subject to the substantive and procedural laws of that State, not the Federal Government. To protect State water rights, I am introducing the State Water Sovereignty Protection Act. 
   The State Water Sovereignty Protection Act provides that whenever the United States seeks to appropriate water or acquire a water right, it will be subject to State procedural and substantive water law. The Act further holds that States control the water within their boundaries and that the Federal Government may exercise management or control over water only in compliance with State law. Finally, in any administrative or judicial proceeding in which the United States participates pursuant to the McCarran Amendment, the United States is subject to all costs and fees to the same extent as costs and fees may be imposed on a private party.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senator LOTT. It is an amendment that will repeal the current statute that reduces retirement payment for regular officers of the uniformed service who choose to work for the Federal Government. The uniformed services include the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, the Public Health Service, and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency. 
   If a retired officer from the uniformed services comes to work for the Senate, his or her retirement pay is reduced by about 50 percent, after the first $8,000, to offset for payments from the Senate. 
   The retired officer can request a waiver but the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government handle the waiver process differently on a case by case basis. 
   The dual compensation limitation is also discriminatory in that regular officers are covered by reservists and enlisted personnel are not covered by the limitation. 
   My amendment should be scored at zero because no additional discretionary funds are required to implement the change and the uniformed services retirement system is fully funded to pay retirees their full retirement benefit that they have earned. 
   In fact, because of this law, many of them are discouraged from seeking employment from the federal government. I have been unable to find one good reason to explain why we should want our law to discourage retired members of the uniformed services from seeking full time employment with the federal government. It deprives them of an important opportunity for employment and it deprives our government from their able expertise and service. 
   This amendment would fix this inequity, and give retired officers equal pay for equal work from the federal government and it would give the federal government access to a workforce that currently avoids employment with the federal government. 
   I hope this amendment will be accepted by all involved. I yield back my time.

   Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Chair and the Senator from Michigan. I appreciate the Senator's commitment. 
   This amendment simply eliminates the dual compensation prohibition in the statute. It does not specifically address the administrative cap that Congress has on top of that limitation placed on those who seek employment with Congress. 
   It should be clarified that although it does not remove the cap that the Senate and House have administratively placed on their own circumstances, it does solve the problem for our military retirees in all other branches of Government. And with regard to the Congress, it solves the problem up to the cap that Congress has put into place, which is a significant benefit to those who now are not able to get any support from the circumstance after the first $8,000 of compensation. 
   I agree with what I assume to be the ranking member's concerns and would be very willing to work with them to try to address that situation with regard to the administrative cap imposed by the Senate and by the House. But we must solve these problems one step at a time, and the first step must be to eliminate the dual compensation prohibition in the statute.

   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, no, I have not discussed removing the administrative cap with those who placed it, but I would be very willing, as I said before, to do so and to work toward that end because I agree that that is one more inequity that should be removed. I think it is an inequity that already exists and, as the chairman indicated, only applies--if this amendment passes, it only applies at the very highest levels of salary, then only to a very small number of personnel, but that inequity should also be removed, and I would be glad to work on that effort.
