 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, following Senate approval of the resolution of ratification for the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and subsequent ratification of the treaty by the President, it became necessary for the United States to enact legislation to implement its various domestic obligations. The Foreign Relations and Judiciary Committees of the Senate immediately fulfilled their obligation to prepare implementing legislation once the treaty had been ratified. On May 23, 1997, the full Senate passed S. 610--`the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1997.' Soon thereafter, on November 12, 1997, the House of Representatives passed the implementing legislation, together with sanctions on Russian firms that are assisting Iran's ballistic missile program. 
I regret that it has taken so long to enact the implementing legislation into law, if for no other reason than that I expect numerous U.S. companies to challenge the constitutionality of the treaty and overturn it in the courts. Unfortunately, final resolution of the legal issues surrounding the CWC, as well as full U.S. compliance with the treaty, has been delayed this entire session of Congress because of President Clinton's opposition to the unrelated missile sanctions provisions of the bill. Indeed, the President sought to delay and derail CWC implementing legislation throughout the entire spring. The President alone is responsible for putting the United States into noncompliance by delaying and then ultimately vetoing the bill (on June 23, 1998). 
It is important that those who are frustrated with the slow pace of U.S. implementation of the CWC understand that the Congress has discharged its obligation to provide implementing legislation for the President's signature not once--but twice. It is the President, not Congress, who has blocked speedy and complete adherence to the treaty. 
For the record, I note that two trade associations were directly involved in the crafting of the CWC's implementing legislation. The President and CEO of the Chemical Manufacturers Association wrote to me on May 7, 1998, stating that S. 610 was `a reasonable approach to meet U.S. obligations under the CWC and protect industry's interests.' The Vice President for Regulatory Affairs of the American Forest and Paper Association wrote to Senator Hatch on May 21, 1997, offering its support for S. 610 since the bill `contains a number of provisions that the forest products industry believes are crucial to ensuring that implementation of the CWC is reasonable and meets the stated purpose of the treaty.' 
I submit the following assessment which details the most significant provisions of the implementing legislation, together with an explanation of the Senate's rationale.  
Section 3. Definitions. Section 3 specifically lists those chemical formulae (and a few bio-toxins) falling under the terms: `Schedule 1 chemical agent'; `Schedule 2 chemical agent'; and `Schedule 3 chemical agent'. Any chemical not listed in Section 3 as either a Schedule 1, 2, or 3 chemical agent is not subject to the any of the requirements under the legislation relating to such chemical agents (e.g. data declaration and routine inspections). 
The Annex on Chemicals of the CWC excludes some chemicals which are capable of being used as chemical weapons precursors, but which also have wide commercial applications. As a result, verification measures are not applied under the Convention to those chemicals. For this reason, if the CWC were to be expanded in scope, the most likely candidates for addition to the Annex are dual-use chemicals which are produced in large commercial quantities for purposes not prohibited under the Convention. The addition of these chemicals to the Annex on Chemicals likely would increase the number of businesses affected by the Convention's verification regime, entailing additional reporting and data declarations from companies, and subjecting additional facilities to routine inspections. 
Thus the implementing legislation is deliberately structured to ensure that a change in law will be required before any provision of the Verification Annex can be applied to any new chemical or biological substance added to the Annex on Chemicals. This will provide both the Congress and the American public sufficient opportunity to examine proposals by the executive branch to expand the CWC. Indeed, depending upon the extent to which the addition of a chemical (or other type of substance) is judged to substantively increase the scope of application of the CWC, such a change also might require the advice and consent of the Senate. 
The American Forest and Paper Association specifically supported the requirement that `additions or deletions from the list would only be permitted by legislative amendment, and not through the administrative regulatory process.' 
Section 102. No Abridgement of Constitutional Rights. This section makes clear that the Federal Government may not force anyone to waive any Constitutional right as a condition for entering into a contract with the federal government or as a condition for receiving any other form of benefits from the government. This provision works in conjunction with Section 308, which amends The Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act. Many of the companies subject to the reporting and inspection requirements of the CWC work under contract to the federal government. Sections 102 and 308 protect these companies by prohibiting the government from imposing, as a condition of a contract, the requirement that they must agree to warrantless searches under the CWC or forego any other Constitutional right (such as the right to challenge the constitutionality of the CWC). The same protections apply to individuals receiving benefits from the United States. 
Section 103. Civil Liability of the United States. Section 103 is necessary to address Fifth Amendment problems which arise with respect to the CWC. The Convention requires that the United States provide foreign inspectors with intrusive access into numerous U.S. businesses; this, together with the mandatory data declaration requirements, holds at risk trade secrets and critical proprietary information. For instance, the authority of inspectors to collect data and take samples for analysis may constitute a form of illegal seizure and the taking of private property without compensation. But the CWC contains no provisions to ensure just compensation to those whose property has been taken. 
Proprietary information is often the basis for a chemical company's competitive edge. As a practical matter, a wide variety of things are considered proprietary or sensitive. For instance, the following are often considered to be `trade secrets': (1) the formula of a new drug or specialty chemical; (2) a synthetic route that requires the fewest steps or the cheapest raw materials; (3) the form, source, composition, and purity of raw materials or solvents; (4) a new catalyst that improves the selectivity, efficiency, or yield of a reaction; (5) the precise order and timing with which chemicals are fed into a reactor; (6) subtle changes in pressure or temperature at key steps in a process; (7) isolation methods that give the highest yields consistent with good recycling of solvents and reagents; (8) expansion and marketing plans; (9) raw materials and suppliers; (10) manufacturing cost data; (11) prices and sales figures; (12) names of technical personnel working on a particular project; and (13) customer lists. 
The theft of any one of these items could result in a loss of revenue and investment that could damage a large company, and drive a small one out of business. Because some trade secrets are not all that complex, even simple visual inspection could reveal proprietary information of great value to a competitor. During routine inspections, for example, companies will run the risk that a skilled chemical engineer equipped with knowledge of the target facility and a list of specific questions to be answered will learn a great deal about that business' activities. 
The Fifth Amendment provides that no private property shall `be taken for public use without just compensation.' As one noted constitutional scholar, Ronald Rotunda, warned the Foreign Relations Committee on March 31, 1997: `If the federal government would simply take this property, the Constitution requires that it pay just compensation. If the federal government sets up a legal structure that allows international inspectors to make off with intellectual property, there is a `taking' for purposes of the just compensation clause.' 
The CWC, however, does not provide for just compensation in the event of misuse of treaty inspection rights. In the absence of a treaty-mandated remedy, the only means of guaranteeing Fifth Amendment protections is to hold the federal government liable for the legal structure it has created by ratifying the CWC. It is the federal government, after all, which approved a treaty giving foreign nationals access to U.S. facilities, thereby creating the potential for the taking of private property. 
Section 103 provides U.S. companies and citizens with the right to bring a civil action for money damages against the United States for the actions of foreign inspectors and other OPCW employees (as well as U.S. government personnel) undertaken pursuant to, or under the color of the CWC or the implementing legislation. It precludes the federal government from raising sovereign immunity as a defense, and establishes a process whereby, once a prima facie case has been established that proprietary information has been divulged or taken, the burden to disprove the claim falls upon the United States. In so doing, Section 103 establishes a reasonable standard of evidence to be used in resolving this type of civil action, given the ambiguity that often surrounds suspicions of the theft of trade secrets. 
Section 103 defers action on a civil claim for one year, providing a period of time for the United States to pursue diplomatic and other remedies to seek redress for the claim. However, once the claim moves forward, Section 103 establishes a clear policy and process by which the U.S. government shall pursue recoupment of all funds paid in satisfaction of any tort or taking for which the U.S. has been held liable. In particular, the United States will impose severe sanctions on all foreign entities (both governmental and private) involved in the theft of the trade secret in question. Sanctions against foreign governments can be waived by the President on a case-by-case basis, though sanctions against foreign persons are lifted only once the U.S. has received `full and complete compensation.' 
These provisions are designed to operate together with the requirements of Condition 16 of the resolution of ratification for the CWC. Pursuant to that condition, in the event that `persuasive information' becomes available indicating that a U.S. citizen has suffered financial losses or damages due to the unauthorized disclosure of confidential business information, the President is required to secure a waiver of immunity from jurisdiction for any foreign person responsible for financial losses or damages to a U.S. citizen, or to withhold half of the U.S. contribution to the OPCW until the situation has been resolved `in a manner satisfactory to the United States person who has suffered the damages. . .' 
Section 302. Facility Agreements. Section 302 prohibits the United States from concluding facility agreements which would prohibit U.S. businesses from withholding consent to an inspection request for any reason or no reason (thereby triggering a requirement for a search warrant under Section 305). It also ensures that representatives from U.S. companies may participate in preparations for the negotiation of a facility agreement, and may observe such negotiations to the maximum extent practicable. 
Section 303. Authority to Conduct Inspections. In addition to providing the legal basis by which U.S. companies may be inspected by foreign personnel, Section 303 ensures that at least one special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall accompany each inspection conducted under the Convention. This ensures a minimum of protection against the possible theft of trade secrets for U.S. companies. 
Section 303 also prohibits OSHA or EPA employees from escorting or otherwise accompanying inspection teams, and requires that the number of U.S. government personnel be kept to the minimum number necessary. The Administration asserted, in response to a question for the record before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, that the U.S. Government would be permitted `to use information or materials obtained during inspections in regulatory, civil, or criminal proceedings conducted for the purpose of law enforcement, including those that are not directly related to enforcement of the CWC.' This alarmed many companies. 
The American Forest and Paper Association stated its support for Section 302(b)(2)(B), noting that `[t]he treaty should not be used as an omnibus vehicle for regulatory inspections unrelated to its intended purpose. We believe that it would be inappropriate to include such government officials [from OSHA and EPA] on an international inspection team formed for the purposes set out in the CWC and would merely serve to detract from the intent of the inspection.' 
By barring EPA and OSHA officials from participating in CWC inspections, Section 303 prevents the Administration from using the Convention to gain a degree of access to facilities which it otherwise is denied. As Professor Rotunda noted in his March 31, 1997, letter: `Searches that violate the Fourth Amendment are not cured of the violation by the simple expedient of a treaty ratification or an executive agreement.' 
Finally, Section 303 establishes a reasonable legal standard by which the President is expected to evaluate the risk posed by an individual inspector to the national security or economic well-being of the United States. The President has the right under the CWC to object to an individual serving as an inspector in the United States. Section 303 obligates him to give `great weight to his reasonable belief that . . . the participation of such an individual as a member of an inspection team would pose a risk to the national security or economic well-being of the United States.' 
As has been noted, the CWC provides inspectors from foreign countries unprecedented access to U.S. facilities--both commercial and government-related. The risk that trade secrets or national security secrets could be stolen during an inspection is very high. In particular, because chemicals covered by the CWC are used in a variety of aerospace activities--from the manufacture of advanced composites and ceramics to additives for paints and fuels--dozens of defense contractors are targeted for routine inspections under the CWC. Thus a threat to proprietary information often also will constitute a threat to national security information. 
Certainly a number of countries intend to use CWC inspections for commercial espionage. Several incidents of concern have already occurred in this respect. For this reason, the Senate adopted a common-sense approach to the standard of evidence required by the President in exercising the right of inspector refusal. A decision to apply a higher evidentiary standard than `reasonable belief' would be inconsistent with Section 303. 
Section 304. Procedures for Inspections. Section 304 contains a number of critical protections for U.S. companies. First, Section 304 (b)(3)(B) requires that notification of a challenge inspection pursuant to Article IX of the Convention `shall also include all appropriate evidence of reasons provided by the requesting state party to the Convention for seeking the inspection. The requirement for specific identification of the reasons for a challenge inspection will enable companies to formulate their own views on the extent to which `probable cause' exists for such an inspection. As the Committee's analysis of Sections 305 makes clear, the CWC does not require a foreign country to demonstrate `probable cause' when it initiates a challenge inspection of a commercial U.S. facility. For this reason, the Congress has adopted implementing legislation which specifically raises the question of the constitutionality of the CWC's challenge inspection regime and provides for expedited review by the courts (under Section 503). Many in the Senate expect the Supreme Court to rule against the constitutionality of the sweeping inspection rights under Article IX of the CWC. 
Section 304(f) allows the U.S. company or person to be inspected to determine who shall take samples during an inspection. It also reiterates the requirement, imposed pursuant to the resolution of ratification of the CWC, that `[n]o sample collected in the United States may be transferred for analysis to any laboratory outside the territory of the United States.' This provision mirrors the Presidential certification requirement contained in Condition 18 of the resolution of ratification for the CWC. 
The CWC explicitly affords an inspection team the right to take samples on-site and, pursuant to Part II paragraph (E)(55) of the Verification Annex, `if it deems necessary, to transfer samples for analysis off-site at laboratories designated by the Organization.' As Part II paragraph (E)(57) makes clear: `when off-site analysis is to be performed, samples shall be analysed in at least two designated laboratories.' 
In agreeing to both Condition 18 of the CWC's resolution of ratification and Section 304(f) of the implementing legislation, the Executive Branch acknowledged that the United States intends to field two OPCW-designated laboratories. Specifically, the Department of Defense intends to field a mobile laboratory which will be available to analyze samples taken in the United States. While sample residue left in the laboratory's equipment would preclude it from leaving U.S. territory, the lab is intended to serve as a counterpart to a second mobile laboratory operated by the OPCW (which could be deployed to countries unable to secure OPCW approval for a facility). 
There is no treaty-requirement that analysis be done in laboratories operated by countries other than the one where a sample was taken. The United States may legally preclude the transfer of samples overseas while still meeting the CWC requirement that samples-analysis be conducted in two designated laboratories. 
Some have argued that Section 304(f) sets a `dreadful example' prompting countries to deny foreign inspectors the ability to send chemical samples abroad for analysis at independent laboratories. Such arguments fail to recognize several key points. First, any country that succeeds in obtaining OPCW accreditation for two laboratories has the treaty-right to insist that samples be analyzed `in country,' regardless of U.S. policy. 
Second, opponents of sampling limitations overstate the scientific capacity and technical capability of proliferant countries to secure OPCW approval for two laboratories. To date, the OPCW has not given approval to any lab in any country; certainly no country has secured approval for two. Indeed, only a handful of western European countries, and perhaps Russia and China, have the ability to field two approved laboratories. The former countries pose no proliferation concern, and both Russia and China are capable of completely concealing their chemical warfare program from international inspectors (making sampling irrelevant). Thus the argument that U.S. strictures on sampling transfers will undo the CWC's verification regime are unsupportable. 
Third, those who criticize Section 304(f) overstate the value of sampling analysis to U.S. nonproliferation efforts. On March 1, 1989, then-Director of Central Intelligence, Judge William Webster, pointed out the ease with which chemical weapons production can be concealed: `. . . within fewer than 24 hours, some say 8 1/2 hours, it would be relatively easy for the Libyans to make the site [at Rabta] appear to be a pharmaceutical facility. All traces of chemical weapons production could be removed in that amount of time.' Similarly, delays of just a few hours have undercut UNSCOM's efforts to prove Iraqi chemical and biological concealment activities. 
In contrast, the CWC gives proliferant countries five days of advance warning to conceal their activities before a challenge inspection team must be allowed on-site. Very simple techniques, such as the production of pesticides on a line used to manufacture nerve agent (e.g. production of the pesticide methyl-parathion instead of the nerve agent sarin), will reduce or eliminate the utility of sampling analysis. 
Fourth, the over-focus on analysis to be done by `independent' laboratories ignores UNSCOM's experience with Iraq's VX program. In the case of samples taken from warheads believed to be weaponized with VX, `independent' laboratories in France, Switzerland, and the United States have given contradictory and inconsistent analyses. This has only complicated U.S. efforts to prove to the international community that Saddam Hussein's nerve agent program is far more advanced than admitted by Iraq. This has occurred despite UNSCOM's relatively unfettered ability--at least in comparison with the CWC--to take samples when and where it pleases. Because the CWC's timeframes provide cheating nations with ample opportunity to mask chemical warfare signatures, analysis of samples at foreign laboratories is guaranteed to make U.S. efforts to prove noncompliance harder, not easier. This will be the case regardless of whether sampling analysis is done `in-country.' 
Fifth, in addition to overselling the value of sampling analysis to the CWC's verification regime, opponents of Section 304(f) persist in ignoring the threat that such procedures pose to legitimate commercial activities. A loss of proprietary information through sample analysis would bankrupt many chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries. Moreover, chemical formulas, which are the type of proprietary information put at greatest risk by sampling, often are not patented. This is done to preserve competitive advantage and to prevent disclosure pursuant to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. But the lack of a patent also will make it harder for U.S. companies to prove that a trade secret has been stolen. 
The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimated in August, 1993, that the U.S. chemical industry loses approximately $3-6 billion per year in counterfeited chemicals and chemical products. A U.S. pharmaceutical firm spends on average about $350 million to research and develop a new compound. Clearly, while it is difficult to assess the potential dollar losses associated with the CWC, information gleaned from sampling analysis could be worth millions of dollars to foreign competitors. Equally troubling is the fact that the CWC does not require the return of samples to the country from which they were taken, but instead gives the Technical Secretariat of the OPCW responsibility over final disposition. This further increases the possibility that proprietary information contained in the sample will be compromised. 
As Kathleen Bailey, then-Senior Fellow at Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, warned in testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee: `Experts in my laboratory recently conducted experiments to determine whether or not there would be a remainder inside of the equipment that is used for sample analysis on-site. They found out that, indeed, there is residue remaining. And if the equipment were taken off-site, off of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory site, or off of the site of a biotechnology firm, for example, and further analysis were done on those residues, you would be able to get classified and/or proprietary information.' 
Numerous other distinguished witnesses expressed concern regarding the threat to trade secrets posed by the CWC's intrusiveness, including Donald Rumsfeld, former Secretary of Defense and President and former Chairman and CEO of G.D. Searle and Company; James Schlesinger, former Secretary of Defense and former Director of Central Intelligence; Lieutenant General William Odom, former Director of the National Security Agency; Lieutenant General James Williams, former Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency; Edward J. O'Malley, former Assistant Director of Federal Bureau of Investigation, Chief of Counterintelligence; and Bruce Merrifield, former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Technology. It was on the basis of the testimony of these individuals, and the concerns expressed by numerous companies and industries (ranging from members of the Chemical Manufacturers Association and the Aerospace Industries Association to other types of companies such as the one that manufactures special ink for the dollar bill) that the Congress chose to prohibit the transfer of samples overseas for analysis. 
Section 305. Warrants. Section 305 builds upon Condition 28 of the resolution of ratification for the CWC, which required the President to certify to Congress that, for any challenge inspection where consent has been withheld, the United States `will first obtain a criminal search warrant based upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and describing with particularity the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. . . .' Further, the President certified pursuant to Condition 28 that an administrative search warrant issued by a United States magistrate judge would be required for involuntary routine inspections. 
Accordingly, Section 305 requires Administrative search warrants for routine inspections where consent has been withheld. It limits routine inspections to no more than one per year per plant site. Additionally, for Schedule 3 facilities and sites working with discrete organic chemicals, Section 305 requires the federal government to affirm in an affadavit, prior to obtaining an administrative search warrant, that a given routine inspection: (1) `will not cause the number of routine inspections in the United States to exceed 20 in a calendar year;' and (2) the facility to be inspected was selected randomly by the Technical Secretariat, taking into account equitable geographic distribution of inspections and other relevant information relating to the site in question. Finally, Section 305 requires that the federal government stipulate in its affadavit that the routine inspection will not exceed the time limits specified in the Convention unless the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the plant agrees. 
Section 305 requires criminal search warrants for any challenge inspection where consent has been withheld. In seeking the warrant, the federal government is required to provide to the judge of the United States all appropriate evidence or reasons showing probable cause to believe that a violation of the implementing legislation (and thus the treaty) is occurring. 
In the event that a frivolous challenge inspection is initiated against the United States, perhaps in retribution for a U.S.-initiated inspection, the federal government may prove unable to provide sufficient probable cause to obtain a criminal search warrant. Under the CWC, a country wishing to initiate a challenge inspection is not required to provide any supporting evidence. The request for an inspection simply is made; unless 31 of 41 members of the Executive Council of the OPCW vote against it proceeding within 12 hours of such a request, the challenge inspection will move forward. Thus the `screen' against frivolous or abusive inspections is of a political, rather than evidentiary, nature. Moreover, review under the CWC of whether the challenge inspection request was within the scope of the CWC, or whether the right to request a challenge inspection had been abused, is allowed only retroactively (following conclusion of the inspection). Therefore nothing in the Convention prevents a challenge inspection from being initiated against a U.S. company without `probable cause' having been demonstrated. 
As will be discussed in connection with Section 503, the courts will ultimately serve as the final arbiter over questions of the CWC's constitutionality. 
Section 307. National Security Exception. Section 307 allows the President to deny any inspection request that `may pose a threat to the national security interests of the United States.' This simple provision is designed to protect the United States from frivolous inspections. 
A recent Stimson Center report makes the claim that `[t]he national security exception negates the treaty obligation to accept a challenge inspection at any U.S. location.' This statement incorrectly asserts that the United States has such an obligation. Condition 28 of the resolution of ratification clearly established that the United States will not agree to a broad treaty obligation to accept a challenge inspection at any U.S. location. Rather, the United States will agree to inspections under Article IX of the CWC only in those cases where either consent to an inspection has been given, or probable cause has been demonstrated and a criminal search warrant obtained. Under any other circumstances, no access will be given. 
Thus the argument made against Section 307 is flawed on its face. Moreover, the CWC explicitly gives the United States the right, for instance, under paragraph 41 of Part X of the Verification Annex, to `take such measures as are necessary to protect national security.' Indeed, as paragraph 38 makes clear, access to sensitive facilities must be negotiated between the inspection team and the inspected State Party; moreover, the inspection team is obligated to use of the least intrusive procedures possible. Under paragraph 42, should the United States provide `less than full access to places, activities, or information' the United States incurs the obligation to `make every reasonable effort to provide alternative means to clarify the possible non-compliance concern that generated the challenge inspection.' 
Section 307 clarifies the fact that the President has the right, both under the Constitution and pursuant to the treaty, to deny a potentially-damaging inspection. However, the exercise of such a denial must be made `consistent with the objective of eliminating chemical weapons.' Thus the President is obligated to provide alternative means of clarifying non-compliance concerns, and must consider the implications of a denial for the operation of the CWC, and for U.S. nonproliferation efforts. The national security interests of the United States, however, must remain paramount. 
Section 402. Prohibition Relating to Low Concentrations of Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 Chemicals. The CWC does not define the term `low concentration' as it relates to Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 chemicals. Section 402 establishes the intent of the United States to interpret this term to mean a 10 percent concentration of a Schedule 2 chemical and an 80 percent concentration of a Schedule 3 chemical (measured either by volume or total weight, whichever yields the lesser percent). In setting the percentages at these levels, Section 402 ensures that Schedule 2 chemicals, which are of direct concern for chemical weapons production, are captured in low concentrations. It also recognizes the broad range of commercial uses for Schedule 3 chemicals, and reduces the regulatory impact of the CWC on many industries. 
No chemical is placed on Schedule 2 of the CWC unless it meets specific criteria: (1) it must be lethal enough that it could be used as a chemical weapon by itself; (2) it can serve as a precursor in the final stage of the manufacture of a chemical weapon, or otherwise is important to the production of a chemical weapon; and (3) is not produced `in large commercial quantities.' Obviously, such chemicals should be tightly controlled even at relatively dilute levels. 
Schedule 3, on the other hand, contains seventeen chemicals which are produced in large commercial quantities for use in production of various organic chemicals and agricultural products. Additionally, these chemicals are used to make gasoline additives, pharmaceuticals, detergents, flame retardant materials, and dyestuffs, among other things. There are 17 compounds on Schedule 3. 
Schedule 3A (4), Chloropicrin, has important uses for the disinfection of cereals and grains, considerably increasing the potential storage life. It is also used as a soil insecticide to sterilize the soil before the planting of crops that are very sensitive to weed competition. 
Schedule 3B (5), Phosphorous oxychloride, is used as an insecticide, as a chlorinating agent, flame retardant, gasoline additive, hydraulic fluid, organic synthesis, plasticizer, and as dopant for semiconductors. 
Phosphorous trichloride, Schedule 3B (6), is used in dyestuffs, surfactants, plasticizers, gasoline additives, insecticides, and in organic synthesis. 
Phosphorous pentachloride, Schedule 3B (7), is used as a pesticide, in plastics, and in organic synthesis. 
Trimethyl phosphite, Schedule 3B (8), is used in insecticides, organic synthesis, veterinary drugs. 
Triethyl phosphite, Schedule 3B (9), is used in insecticide synthesis, as a lubricant additive, in organic synthesis, and as a plasticizer. 
Schedule 3B (10), Dimethyl phosphite, is used in insecticide production, as a lubricant additive, in organic synthesis, and as a veterinary drug. 
Diethyl phosphite (Schedule 3B (11)) is used in the production of insecticides, as a gasoline additive, as a paint solvent, in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, and in organic synthesis. 
Sulfur monochloride (Schedule 3B (12)) is used extensively as an intermediate and chlorinating agent in the production of dyes and insecticides. It is also used for cold vulcanisation of rubber, in the treatment of vegetable oils and for hardening soft woods, in pharmaceuticals, organic synthesis, as a polymerization catalyst, and in the extraction of gold from ores. 
Thionyl Chloride, Schedule 3B (14), is used in batteries, engineering plastics, pesticides, as a catalyst, surfactant, chlorinating agent, and in organic synthesis of herbicides, drugs, vitamins, and dyestuffs. Common agricultural products involving this chemical are: Fenvalerate, Endosulfan, Methidathion, Flucythrinate, Fluvalinate, Lethane, Diphenamit, Napromaide, Propamide, Tridiphane, Topan, and Pipertain. 
Schedule 3B (17), Triethanolamine, is another chemical with a widespread use. Because of its surface active properties it is added to waxes and polishes and is used as a solvent for herbicides, shellac and various dyes. It is also used for producing emulsions of various oils, paraffins and waxes, as well as for breaking up emulsion. It is an important ingredient of the cutting oil used for metal shaping. Further uses include in detergents, cosmetics, corrosion inhibitors, as a plasticizer, rubber accelerator, and in organic synthesis. 
As can be seen from this partial listing, the majority of these chemicals are used in agriculture, the automobile industry, and pharmaceuticals production. The vast majority are used as herbicides or insecticides/pesticides. A decision to lower the percentage associated with `low concentrations' of Schedule 3 chemicals would dramatically increase the number of agricultural companies and facilities subject to the CWC's onerous reporting and inspection requirements. The costs resulting from such a dramatic expansion of the CWC's scope would invariably be passed by such companies to the one consumer who can least afford an increase in operating costs at this time--the U.S. farmer. 
Section 403. Prohibition Relating to Unscheduled Discrete Organic Chemicals and Coincidental Byproducts in Waste Streams. Section 403 exempts from reporting and inspection any `unscheduled discrete organic chemical' that is a `coincidental byproduct . . . that is not isolated or captured for use or sale . . . and is routed to, or escapes, from the waste stream of a stack, incinerator, or wastewater treatment system or any other waste stream.' 
The CWC does not list unscheduled discrete organic chemicals. Instead, it generally defines these substances as: `any chemical belonging to the class of chemical compounds consisting of all compounds of carbon except for its oxides, sulfides and metal carbonates, identifiable by chemical name, by structural formula, if known, and by Chemical Abstracts Service registry number if assigned.' This definition captures thousands of chemical compounds--so many that it is impossible to list them. The CWC's sweeping definition of a `discrete organic chemical' captures thousands of U.S. companies under its reporting and inspection obligations. 
However, that number would expand exponentially without Section 403's exclusion of discrete organic chemicals which form as a byproduct in a variety of manufacturing processes. The declaration and inspections costs under the CWC would fall on a far broader number of U.S. companies. Moreover, the costs of compliance for these additional companies will be far greater. Companies must declare the aggregate tonnage of discrete organic chemicals produced. If `production' is defined as the formation of coincidental byproducts in a waste stream, however, many companies would find it costly, and perhaps impossible, to comply with the treaty. 
The paper industry, in particular, has expressed concern over the `discrete organic chemical category,' warning that various chemicals such as methanol, phenol, methyl ethyl ketone, and methyl mercaptan are formed in the process of paper manufacturing. The American Forest and Paper Association warned on May 25, 1994, that `pulp digester gases containing methanol are vented, and some methanol will also be lost as fugitive air emissions from the wastewater treatment system. Methanol is only one component of these streams; it is not isolated or captured for use or sale.' 
Without Section 403, numerous industries are at risk of being required to measure and report on countless chemical interactions in waste streams, and to undergo international inspection to verify the accuracy of their data. On May 21, 1997, the American Forest and Paper Association reiterated its concern over the broad scope of the CWC and stated its support for Section 403: `We strongly support the prohibition of requirements under the treaty for chemical byproducts that are coincidently manufactured. Due to the broad nature of the category of `discrete organic chemicals,' as defined by the treaty, it is critical to recognize that inclusion of coincidental byproducts of manufacturing processes that are not captured or isolated for use or sale would exceed the stated purpose of the CWC.' 
Section 503. Expedited Judicial Review. Section 503 allows for U.S. citizens to challenge the constitutionality of any provision of the implementing legislation (and, therefore, the CWC). Such a challenge must be given priority in its disposition, and a prompt hearing by a full Court of Appeals sitting en banc must be given to a final order entered by a district court. 
In reviewing the constitutionality of legislation, the courts often assume that Congress has exercised its independent judgment and that the legislation in question is constitutional. However, as the legislative history of the CWC makes clear, Congress expressed numerous misgivings about the constitutionality of the CWC (and thus about the implementing legislation required). These concerns were articulated in hearings before the Committees on Foreign Relations and Judiciary, and in correspondence between the Senate, Executive Branch, and U.S. businesses. As has been noted elsewhere, the Senate expressed some specific concerns over the constitutionality of the CWC as conditions in the resolution of ratification. The resolution also included Condition 12, which makes clear that nothing in the CWC authorizes or requires legislation, or any other action prohibited by the Constitution of the United States, as interpreted by the United States. 
Many in the Congress are convinced that the Chemical Weapons Convention is incompatible with the Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights of Americans. It therefore is expected that the courts will hold that some, or all, of the CWC and its implementing legislation is unconstitutional and issue the appropriate injunctions.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in light of the Columbus Day holiday--a day in which we honor Christopher Columbus for discovering a debt-free nation--I am unable to report to Congress our nation's outstanding federal debt from the close of business Friday, October 9, 1998. I do however feel obliged to submit the federal debt from years past. 
With no holiday in site for an escalating national debt, I report, Mr. President, that one year ago, October 9, 1997, the federal debt stood at $5,409,087,000,000 (Five trillion, four hundred nine billion, eighty-seven million). 
Twenty-five years ago, October 9, 1973, the federal debt stood at $459,857,000,000 (Four hundred fifty-nine billion, eight hundred fifty-seven million). 
Mr. President, as we stand in the twilight of budget negotiations for fiscal year 1999, I remind my distinguished colleagues that we must curb the desire to spend, spend, spend. Even with a holiday weekend our federal debt reflects an increase of more than $5 trillion--that is more than 5 million million--during the past 25 years.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we would not be here today were it not for the tireless efforts of Senator Don Nickles. Twenty-eight other Republican and Democratic Senators who co-sponsored S. 1868 (which is essentially the pending substitute amendment) and, for that matter all Americans, owe Senator Nickles and his able staff a debt of gratitude. 
Now then, the pending amendment is a modification of S. 1868. I am a cosponsor of S. 1868, and while I will vote for the pending compromise language, I confess that it does not go far enough for my taste. 
To be sure, these compromises were forced upon the sponsors by a White House and State Department who fought us at every step and habitually moved the goal posts during negotiations. The Clinton Administration may prefer that we do nothing, but doing nothing isn't an option. 
As you know, Mr. President, the Foreign Relations Committee has taken the lead in several historic steps by the Senate in recent months to advance U.S. foreign policy interests--including passage of a far-reaching State Department reorganization and U.N. reform package and the NATO Expansion Treaty. 
Nevertheless, I believe it is obvious that neither initiative has stirred the hearts and souls of the folks back home in churches and synagogues to the same degree as the growing persistent torture and abuse of Christians, Jews and other religious minorities at the hands of intolerant foreign governments. 
Americans are eager for their government to help ease the suffering of their brothers and sisters overseas. They are not at all satisfied with the inaction they have gotten to date. 
I am sure these people--who are the backbone of this nation--have no quarrel with establishing special committees, or issuing reports, or having high level meetings with church groups. But Americans are looking for concrete action from the State Department and the White House--and certainly, people persecuted because of their faith in foreign lands deserve more than kind words and gestures. 
It is important to emphasize that this issue, and the growing concern of Americans, have not fallen on deaf ears in the Senate. The Foreign Relations Committee held five hearings on this issue during the 105th Congress--two specifically on Senator Nickles proposal. I especially want to thank Senators Brownback and Ashcroft for using their subcommittees to focus attention on this issue. 
I hope every Senator will review the video tape of Senator Ashcroft's moving hearing on the tragic plight of Christians in southern Sudan. (These innocent people have been brutally tortured, sold into slavery and, in some instances, literally crucified by the radical Islamic government simply because of their faith in Christ.) 
The point is this: the vote we are about to take is a test to see whether Senators finally realize that we, as a people and a government, must do more to advance the cause of religious freedom across the globe. 
Finally, Mr. President, it is often pointed out--and I believe it with all my heart--that no matter what laws are enacted, religious intolerance will never be erased from the earth. I also believe that the prayers of millions of Americans and other believers around the world will accomplish more than any Act of Congress. 
That does not mean we should not try. I hope the President will join with us as we attempt to strengthen U.S. leadership in this area.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am an original co-sponsor of H.R. 4655, the Iraq Liberation Act, for one simple reason: Saddam Hussein is a threat to the United States and a threat to our friends in the Middle East. 
This lunatic is bent on building an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction with a demonstrable willingness to use them. For nearly eight years the United States has stood by and allowed the U.N. weapons inspections process to proceed in defanging Saddam. That process is now in the final stages of collapse, warning that the U.S. cannot stand idly by hoping against hope that everything will work itself out. 
We have been told by Scott Ritter and others that Saddam can reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction within months. The Washington Post reported only last week that Iraq still has three nuclear `implosion devices'--in other words, nuclear bombs minus the necessary plutonium or uranium to set them off. The time has come to recognize that Saddam Hussein the man is inextricable from Iraq's drive for weapons of mass destruction. For as long as he and his regime are in power, Iraq will remain a mortal threat. 
This bill will begin the long-overdue process of ousting Saddam. It will not send in U.S. troops or commit American forces in any way. Rather, it harkens back to the successes of the Reagan doctrine, enlisting the very people who are suffering most under Saddam's yoke to fight the battle against him. 
The bill requires the President to designate an Iraqi opposition group or groups to receive military drawdown assistance. The President need not look far; the Iraqi National Congress once flourished as an umbrella organization for Kurds, Shi'ites and Sunni Muslims. It should flourish again, but it needs our help. 
Mr. President, the people of Iraq, through representative organizations such as the INC, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the Kurdish Democratic Party and the Shi'ite SCIRI, have begged for our help. The day may yet come when we are dragged back to Baghdad; I believe that day can be put off, perhaps even averted, by helping the people of Iraq help themselves. 
Opponents of this initiative--I shouldn't call them friends of Saddam--have said that the Iraqi opposition exists in name only, that they are too parochial to come together. They are not entirely wrong--which is why Senator Lott and Chairman Gilman (the lead House sponsor) have carefully crafted the designation requirement in H.R. 4655 to insist that only broad-based, pro-democracy groups be selected by the President to receive drawdown assistance. I would go further, and suggest to the President that he designate just one group, the Iraqi National Congress, in which the Kurds, the Shi'ites and the Sunnis of Iraq hold membership. The opposition must be unified, but it may just take the leadership of the United States to bring them together. 
Finally, this bill gives the Congress oversight over the designation and drawdown authorities. As Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I intend to exercise vigorously that authority. The White House and the State Department have indicated that they support this bill. We have a unique opportunity, and I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that opportunity is not frittered away. The price of failure is far too high.

Mr. Helms. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending October 2 the U.S. imported 7,925,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,567,000 barrels a day less than the 9,492,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
While this is one of the rare weeks when Americans imported slightly less foreign oil than the same week a year ago, Americans still relied on foreign oil for 55.7 percent of their needs last week. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States imported about 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America s oil supply. 
All Americans should ponder the economic calamity certain to occur in the U.S. if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S.: now 7,925,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately $110,870,750 a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Department of Justice confirms that in the United States there was a rape for every 270 women, a robbery for every 240 women and an assault for every 29 women in 1994. (In the three year period from 1992-94, the number of violent crimes committed against our wives, sisters, mothers, and daughters totaled nearly 14 million.) 
In response to statistics like these, the women of the National Rifle Association created the `Refuse to be a Victim' program five years ago. The basic premise of the program can be summed up by an old saying--an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The course teaches women not to live in fear of threats, but rather, to respect likely threats and prepare to avoid or effectively respond to them. 
The centerpiece of the `Refuse to be a Victim' program is a three-hour public service safety seminar designed by, taught by, and presented to women in order to help them protect themselves. Since its inception, this common sense safety and self-defense program has been presented in 35 states and the District of Columbia. More than 600 instructors, including 9 in North Carolina, have trained and empowered thousands of women to protect themselves and their families. 
Mr. President, the course equips women with the tools they need to design their own personal safety strategy. By increasing awareness of dangerous situations and providing knowledge of self-protection techniques and crime-fighting and personal safety resources, the program maximizes its participants ability to successfully avoid or, in the worst case, survive an attack. 
The program features practical but frequently overlooked advice on home security such as the installation of effective lock and security systems, planting `defensive' shrubbery around windows, and keeping a cellular phone by the bedside in case an intruder disables your home phone. It also provides information on how to avoid being a victim of a car-jacker as well as the proper and safe use of personal safety devices such as alarms, sprays, stun guns and firearms. 
For those unable to attend a seminar personally, the program has distributed more than 200,000 of the informative `42 Strategies for Personal Safety' brochures nationwide. 
Mr. President, the women of the NRA are to be commended for the development of this important program. The contributions of the `Refuse to be a Victim' program are indeed impressive. This program is a fine example of the type of pro-active safety and security training that the National Rifle Association has long provided to our citizens. I hope that women in every part of our great nation will consider participating in this outstanding program and, in so doing, join the more than ten thousand women who have already benefited from it.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, when one pauses to ponder the implications of it all, 1998 has been a remarkable year in terms of there having been a sort of rebirth of (I still contend) America's great national pastime--baseball. 
And as an old (very) former sports writer, I have never pretended that baseball has not always been my favorite sport. I like all of them, I hasten to say, but baseball is, to this good day, Number One with me. 
So what, you may inquire, has made this year all that great? Let us begin by recounting the drama of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, each of whom broke the 37-year-old home run record of Roger Maris--and then kept on breaking their own records. 
I had meant, Mr. President, to pay my respects long ago to 14 very special youngsters from Greenville, North Carolina, who made hearts beat faster and faster as the team made their way to the national championship game of the Little League World Series. 
Greenville is the hometown of a lot of good things and good people. East Carolina University is there, including its splendid medical school. It is a colorful city (56,000) which understands and practices the free enterprise system. And you better believe that everybody in the area around Greenville was proud of those 14 young Little Leaguers who made it to the championship game. 
The young guys from Greenville lost that championship game to the team from Toms River, New Jersey, but they were winners big time just the same because they did win the consolation game with the excellent Canadian team. Look at it this way, Mr. President--the Little League team from Greenville ranks third in the world. 
I have a hunch that they know that they are Number One in the hearts of all of us who watched them on television, night after night, cheering them on. 
I should mention, by the way, that these comments were prompted by a fine young member of the Helms Senate Family, Josh Royster, who kept track of those fantastic youngsters from Greenville who made all of us proud. 
Josh was impressed with the manner in which coaches and parents and countless other folks sacrificed to support their team. They traveled across the country for the better part of six weeks, rooting for the Greenville Fourteen. That's what morale and role modeling and love and good citizenship are all about. And then when the 14 young guys arrived home, Josh says that 2,000 people turned out to greet them and cheer them on. 
A long time ago, when I was a lot younger than the Little Leaguers of 1998, Dad told me something that I have never forgotten: `Son,' he said, `the Lord doesn't require you to win. He just expects you to try.' 
Those 14 young guys did try and I suspect they won a lot more than they now realize. For one thing, there's a Senator up here who's hoping that Greenville's Little Leaguers will be in the championship game again next season. I am not alone in my feeling that those youngsters will be glad they did.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, during the past weekend in going through a file folder, I ran across a letter somehow placed there inadvertently this past July just before my surgery to replace my worn-out 1921-Model knees with new 1998-Models. 
The letter was from a longtime friend, Jim Lofton, well-known in Congress for his years as a highly respected assistant to the distinguished then-Congressman, Jim Broyhill, of North Carolina. (Jim subsequently served North Carolina's Governor Jim Martin who also had been a Congressman from North Carolina). 
Jim Lofton, now president of the North Carolina Association of Financial Institutions, had written to share the text of an address by another distinguished North Carolinian, Thomas J. Harrelson, who on July 1 had delivered an inspiring address to an audience of several hundred people, including 41 new U.S. citizens whose naturalization occurred at the ceremony in Southport at which Mr. Harrelson spoke. Mr. Lofton decided, quite correctly, that I might want to share Tommy Harrelson's remarks at Southport by inserting the text into the Congressional Record.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports, for the week ending September 25, that the U.S. imported 9,953,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,691,000 barrels a day more than the 8,262,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 54.6 percent of their needs last week. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States imported about 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
All Americans should ponder the economic calamity certain to occur in the U.S. if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S.: now 9,953,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately $132,175,840 a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the recent discovery of a sophisticated spy ring operating in U.S. territory is a wake-up call to all who assume that Fidel Castro is no longer America's tireless enemy. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is to be congratulated for its excellent work, and, I ask unanimous consent that the Bureau's press release (dated September 14, 1998) be printed in the Record.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the fact that several U.S. military installations were among the targets of this spying is evidence that the Castro regime is a menace to the national security of the United States. According to a reliable 1996 report, Cuban commandos have been training in Vietnam at least since 1990 to carry out strikes against U.S. military bases, precisely the target of the attempted infiltrations of last week. 
Mr. President, the Clinton Administration simply cannot and must not default on its clear obligation to respond to this and other hostile actions by Cuba. 
First, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is obliged to pursue this espionage conspiracy relentlessly. Any and all Cuban personnel working in any diplomatic posts in Washington, D.C., and at the United Nations, who had contact with this spy ring should be detained, prosecuted, and/or expelled without delay. 
Future requests by Cuban `diplomats' to travel beyond the confines of Washington, D.C., or New York--particularly to South Florida--should be summarily denied. 
Second, U.S. officials, exile groups, and citizens who have been, or are, targets of Cuban spies should be warned by U.S. authorities of this threat. 
Third, it is imperative to hold the Russians accountable for their continued eavesdropping on U.S. defense and commercial communications at the state-of-the-art intelligence facility at Lourdes, Cuba. According to reliable published reports, sensitive U.S. information gathered at Lourdes is in the possession of Castro's Cubans and made available to other rogue states to use against the United States. The Russians compensate Castro for this spy platform through a generous oil-for-sugar deal--at a time when Moscow looks to the United States and the international community for multi-billion-dollar hand-outs of the American taxpayers' money. 
Mr. President, the Clinton Administration at this very moment is contemplating a huge increase in U.S. aid to Russia, has therefore soft-peddled this grave security threat for too long. The removal of the Lourdes facility and an end to the related compensation to the Cubans must be given top priority in U.S.-Russian relations--and as a subject to be considered in the instances of future U.S. aid proposals. 
Fourth, this hostile espionage should put to rest the absurd notion--conceived by the Cuban regime and being considered by Administration officials--that the United States should `cooperate' with the Cuban government to fight drug trafficking in the Caribbean. Any serious talk about anti-drug cooperation should be deferred until after Castro surrenders the half-dozen senior Cuban officials who have been indicated in U.S. courts for smuggling drugs into the United States. 
Fifth, senior Administration policy makers have informed members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff that they see no connection between the spy ring and the Clinton plan to give U.S. food aid to the United Nations for Cuba. In light of the espionage revelations, it is incumbent upon the State Department and U.S.A.I.D. to make certain that any food that the Administration proposes to donate to needy Cubans must be conducted entirely through international, independent relief groups operating under scrupulous monitoring. 
And, sixth, Mr. President, Americans have long awaited the Clinton Administration's getting around to holding Castro's officials accountable for the terrorist attack carried out by Cuban MIGs on two unarmed Cessnas in February 1996. The fact that this attack on two small planes which were over international waters went unpunished has emboldened the Castro regime to act against us. 
The Department of Justice should proceed promptly with an investigation of this incident in connection with the indictment of the Cuban officials involved. It should be done under section 32 of title of the U.S. Code for the willful, premeditated destruction of two civil aircraft resulting in the deaths of Pablo Morales, Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and Armando Alejandre. 
Mr. President, the Clinton Administration has an obligation to defend America's national security against any country determined to do us harm. 
Surely, decades of fighting tyrants has taught us that appeasement and unilateral concessions serve only to tempt our enemies. If the Administration fails to hold Castro accountable for his repeated acts of treachery against us, it will tempt him to escalate them.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Mark Twain was right on target with his comment that everybody was talking about the weather but nobody was doing anything about it. 
Well, in our time almost everybody is indeed talking about family values but, thank goodness, many voices are being lifted in a concerted effort to do whatever is necessary to reverse a dangerous trend in America. 
It's a trend that has been leading America down the slippery slope to self destruction. 
The remedy? The preservation and restoration of the moral and spiritual principles and priorities laid down by our Founding Fathers a couple of centuries ago. 
Given the time, I could identify hundreds of souls across this land who are hard at work in this massive restoration project--Bill and Elaine Bennett, for example. And in this Senate there are many who speak out with some regularity on the subject. 
I am proud of them, and in today's special frame of reference, I am specially proud of the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Spence Abraham, and all the cosponsors of S. 1645, The Child Custody Protection Act which is the pending business. 
Mr. President, like, I pray, the majority of Americans, I was outraged by news reports that a 13-year old Pennsylvania girl was taken by a non-relative to another state to have an abortion without her parents' knowledge. Not knowing the whereabouts of a child, is surely a parent's worst nightmare. But, Mr. President, how much more frightening would it be for parents, if federal law permitted a stranger to perform an abortion on their child. Abortion is a medical procedure, potentially, which may cause psychological and physical complications. But this frightening scenario happened, and it will continue to happen if Congress does not pass the `Child Custody Protection Act'. This pending legislation ensures that state laws requiring parental notification before an abortion can be performed on a minor will not be circumvented by crossing a state line. In other words, the parents in Pennsylvania will have their rights protected, so that, in turn, they can protect their 13-year old daughters from this traumatic experience. 
Of course, if we were talking today about a medical procedure, other than abortion, there would be no need to defend a parent's right to be informed. But, this major money-making industry is worrying its pocketbook will be affected if parents are able to discourage their daughters from having an abortion. Abortion advocates are once more pulling out their deceitful tricks and desperately trying to defeat this bill. 
Even Senators who disagree on the legality of abortion should feel comfortable with this legislation, because the vast majority of Americans agree that parental notification laws need to be protected. A recent poll conducted by Baselice & Assoc. shows that 78% of Americans strongly believe that it should be unlawful to take a minor across state lines to obtain an abortion without her parents' knowledge. 
It comes down to this: Congress has an obligation to protect parental rights. Congress needs to protect states, like Pennsylvania, that have decided that parents have a right to be notified about their daughters' intent to destroy an unborn child--a decision, by the way, that even the Supreme Court has deemed constitutional in Planned Parenthood vs. Casey. 
The parents in Pennsylvania are courageous, and they have not minced their words. They state unequivocally that they will not be pushed aside when it comes to being involved with their daughters' well-being. It is up to those of us in Congress to stand by the parents in Pennsylvania and the other states which have passed laws protecting parental authority. 
To be precise, twenty-two other states have passed laws similar to Pennsylvania's--North Carolina being one of them. The parents of North Carolina have exercised their rights as voters and have also said that no abortion shall be performed on their daughter without their knowledge. 
The question Congress needs to ask itself is this: Whose rights are we going to protect, those of abortionists--or parents? Are we going to tolerate that abortionists, who desire nothing more than to make a pretty penny off of young girls who are in a vulnerable state of mind, have more rights than the parents who love and care for their daughters more than anyone else in the world. Congress needs to be unmistakably clear that the job of deciding what is best for a teenager belongs to parents, not abortionists. 
Simply put, America cannot afford to allow parental authority to be undermined. With the breakdown of so many families, it is absolutely critical that nothing further be done to weaken the relationship between parents and their children. While there are numerous contributory factors to society's ills today--the disintegration of the American family is, in my judgement, the primary culprit. 
By passing the `Child Custody Protection Act,' we are saying that the custody of children both rightfully and fundamentally belongs to responsible parents. 
I pray that the Senate will follow the overwhelming decision of the House of Representatives and protect a parent's right to decide what is best for their daughter.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute has reported that for the week ending September 11 that the U.S. imported 8,694,000 barrels of oil each day, 667,000 barrels a day less than the 9,371,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
While this is one of the rare weeks when Americans imported slightly less foreign oil than the same week a year ago, Americans still relied on foreign oil for 58 percent of their needs last week. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States imported about 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
All Americans should ponder the economic calamity certain to occur in the United States, if and when, foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States: now 8,694,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately $104,154,120 a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, one of the most tragic and saddest days in our nation's history was the day the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade that unborn babies can legally be killed by their mothers. Each of us who has fought, heart and soul, to undo that damaging decision, understood so well on January 22, 1973, that we had yet to see what devastation would come of such a horrendous rule. 
Indeed, when a nation condones instead of condemns the inhumane procedure known as partial birth abortion, it is clear our worst fears have come true. 
I am grateful to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Santorum) for his strength and conviction in standing up in defense of countless unborn babies. Rick Santorum's willingness to lead the fight on behalf of passage of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act is a demonstration of courage. 
Our hearts and prayers go out to him and Karen, for their loss of their precious baby son, Michael Gabriel. 
Mr. President, since May 20, 1997, when the Senate voted 64-36 to outlaw the partial birth abortion procedure, a six-pound baby girl was born in the state of Arizona. Of course, there have been countless other precious little lives who have graced this world with their presence since that time. 
What is exceptional about this baby girl, is that she is the first known survivor of the partial birth abortion procedure. Amazingly enough, while the abortionist was in the process of performing the partial birth abortion, this little one's life was spared when it was realized that she was further along in her gestational development than thought. 
Incidentally, it is due to this type of unawareness regarding the developing stages of a baby growing inside a mother's womb, that has led to the senseless murder of millions of the most innocent human beings. 
Thankfully, this baby girl is no longer faceless. Although, her head has been marred by the instruments of the abortionist, and she may carry this scar as a reminder of her close encounter with death, she has been given a name and a home. Not surprisingly, one of the millions of couples who are anxiously waiting to adopt, has taken her into their loving family. Proving once more, there is no such thing as an unwanted baby, just unwanted by some. 
I sincerely pray, Mr. President, that this country has not grown completely stone-cold in its response to the sanctity of human life. But, that Americans would be moved to reevaluate their views on the troublesome issue of abortion when they hear of the baby girl in Arizona, who was just minutes away from having her life cruelly and painfully ended. More specifically, I pray one individual in particular will not for a third time, turn a deaf ear to the countless cries of the other unborn babies who may not be as fortunate to have their lives miraculously spared. I am of course referring to the President of the United States, who has signed the death sentence of the most innocent and helpless human beings imaginable by twice vetoing the underlying legislation. 
President Clinton, and his cadre of extreme pro-abortion allies, have sought to explain the necessity of a procedure that allows a doctor to deliver a baby partially, feet-first from the womb, only to have his or her brains brutally removed. 
However, well-known medical doctors, obstetricians and gynecologist have repeatedly rejected the assertion that a partial birth abortion is needed to protect the health of a women in a late-term complicated pregnancy. Even the American Medical Association wrote a letter endorsing the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. 
Mr. President, there is much to be said about the facts surrounding the number of partial-birth abortions performed annually and the reason they are performed--or at least the given, stated reason. It is hard to overlook the confession of Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, who admitted that he, himself, had deceived the American people on national television about the number and the nature of partial-birth abortions. 
Mr. Fitzsimmons now estimates that up to 5,000 partial-birth abortions are conducted annually on healthy women carrying healthy babies. This is a far cry from the rhetoric espoused by Washington's pro-abortion groups who maintain that only 500 partial-birth abortion are performed every year, and only in extreme medical circumstances. 
Mr. President, it is time for the Senate to once and for all settle this matter and pass the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act with a veto-proof vote and affirm the need to rid America of this senseless, brutal form of killing. It is also important to note that the American people recognize the moral significant of this legislation. The majority of Americans agree that the government must out-law the partial birth abortion. A poll conducted by CNN/Time in January of this year, shows that 74 percent of Americans want the partial birth procedure banned. In fact, more than two dozen states have passed legislation similar to the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. 
Mr. President, regardless of the outcome, when the Senate votes on the question of whether to override President Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, the impact will have grave consequences. For those who care deeply about the most innocent and helpless human life imaginable, failure to override the Clinton veto will border on calamitous. 
The President of the United States should have to explain to the American people why he will not sign this ban over and over again. The spotlight will no longer shine on the much-proclaimed right to choose. Senators have been required to consider whether innocent, tiny baby-partially-born, just 3 inches from the protection of the law-deserves the right to live, and to love and to be loved. The baby is the center of debate in this matter. 
I remember so vividly the day in January 1973, when the Supreme Court handed down the decision to legalize abortion. It was hard to find many people to speak up, certainly on the floor of the Senate, on behalf of unborn babies. 
But it is time, once again, for Members of the Senate to stand up and be counted for or against the most helpless human beings imaginable, for or against the destruction of innocent human life in such a repugnant way. The Senate simply must pass the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, and I pray that it will do it by a margin of at least 67 votes in favor of the ban.

 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, there was this lady of nobility, whom everybody called `Lib,' who was loved by everyone who knew her. She slipped away into eternity on August 15 prompting sadness among the multitudes whom she had helped and befriended during her busy lifetime. 
I met Mrs. Elisabeth Smith in 1972, the year I first became a candidate for the U.S. Senate. She came to our campaign headquarters in Raleigh's Sir Walter Hotel, announcing that she had come to support me--perhaps the most improbable Senate candidate in the history of the republic. 
And support me she did, vigorously, from the first campaign in 1972 down through the years until 1996, the year of my fourth reelection. 
That day in 1972, she had just retired after long service as a registered nurse in the office of a prominent Raleigh physician. 
There was never any question about her fervent love for her country, nor her devotion to the moral and spiritual principles laid down by the Founding Fathers. 
She agreed to take on the responsibilities of treasurer of four of the five campaigns conducted by the Helms for Senate campaign organizations. 
Year after year, Lib Smith was a sort of beloved `mother hen' to the throngs of volunteer campaign workers as well as those who bore primary responsibilities conducting the campaigns. She was a soothing influence when tempers festered. She was a reliable friend to all who needed her. And she performed perfectly and responsibly as the official Treasurer of every Helms for Senate campaign from 1978 through 1990. 
She was a faithful member of St. Timothy's Episcopal Church, the Diocese of North Carolina, and the Altar Guild. In her `spare time' she did the needlework for St. Timothy's Altar Vestments--as well as anything else that needed doing at her church. 
I learned only recently that she was renowned as a ballroom dancer--and as an artist who painted many portraits of loved ones and friends. Her two children--son Phillip W. Smith and daughter Mrs. Gayle Bullock--provided her with four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. 
Mr. President, I know of no one who enjoyed life more than Lib Smith. She brought joy and comfort to countless others. She was a wonderfully remarkable lady whom I will never forget and to whom I shall always be grateful.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute has reported that for the week ending September 4 that the U.S. imported 8,549,000 barrels of oil each day, 998,000 barrels a day more than the 7,551,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 57.2 percent of their needs last week. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States imported about 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
All Americans should ponder the economic calamity certain to occur in the U.S. if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S.: now 8,549,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately $100,963,690 a day.

 Mr. HELMS. I strongly oppose this amendment, which seeks to provide funds to the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
As I advised the President on January 21, of this year, at the conclusion of Senate debate on NATO expansion, the Foreign Relations Committee would then turn its attention to several other critical, pressing matters which could affect the security of the American people and the health of the United States' economy. Chief among these are the agreements on Multilateralization and Demarcation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. 
The President promised more than a year ago to submit these treaties for the Senate's advice and consent, but we are yet to see that promise fulfilled. Nevertheless, the Foreign Relations Committee intends to pursue hearings on a number of associated issues--such as the recent Rumsfeld Commission report--with the presumption that the President's promise will be honored in the near term. 
Indeed, Mr. President, in listening to various justifications for the proposed amendment (which discuss the ongoing development of nuclear weapons by India, Pakistan, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, etc.) I was struck by the urgent need--not for another arms control treaty--but for a national missile defense to protect the United States from these nuclear weapons when they are mounted on intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
Let me repeat that for the purpose of emphasis. The last thing the United States needs is another arms control treaty. In presuming to fund the Preparatory Commission, and in attempting to dictate to the Foreign Relations Committee that CTBT consideration take precedence over the planned ABM Treaty hearings, the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) obviously is willing to place a higher priority on the test ban than on protecting the American people from ballistic missile attack. 
Sure, I have heard the White House and the liberal media attempt to spin India's and Pakistan's actions into a justification for the CTBT. And some seem to have bought it hook-line-and-sinker. But as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee heard a week after the Indian tests, from several expert witnesses, India's nuclear tests demonstrate that the CTBT is a complete sham from a nonproliferation standpoint. 
Mr. President, this Senator will take no part in papering over India's actions with another ban on nuclear testing. The world already has one such treaty, called the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). We should demand that India sign on to that treaty, which already has 185 States Parties and has been in force since 1970, not a `Johnny-come-lately' CTBT, which is--in all respects--a far weaker version of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The point is, Mr. President, there would be no cause for worry about Indian nuclear tests if India has agreed not to have these 
weapons in the first place. 
On the other hand, only less than two dozen countries have ratified the CTBT, of whom only 6 are on the list of the 44 key countries which, pursuant to Article 14 of the treaty, must ratify before it can enter into force. In other words any one of these 44 countries (for example, India, Pakistan, North Korea, or Iran) can single-handedly derail the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty's (CTBT) entry into force. 
That is why, Mr. President, the CTBT is so low on the Committee's list of priorities. It has no chance of entering into force in the foreseeable future, regardless of what the U.S. Senate does, and regardless of whether we waste funds on the Preparatory Commission. I regret that it was necessary to come to the Senate floor and explain such an obvious fact. 
All of this, of course, is without respect to the fact that the CTBT, by preventing tests to ensure the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear deterrent, is a bad idea from a national security standpoint, but that is a debate better reserved for a time and place when the CTBT realistically has a chance of entering into force. 
In sum, Mr. President, I oppose the Specter amendment on both jurisdictional and substantive grounds. Now it is my understanding, on the basis of assurances given by the staff of the Foreign Operations subcommittee, that no funds can be provided to the Preparatory Commission without notification to and approval by the Foreign Relations Committee. However, that said, this amendment is part and parcel of the Clinton Administration's effort to cover up the collapse of its nonproliferation policy. By promoting the CTBT with no mention of the NPT, the Clinton Administration and Senator Specter propose a course of action that will de facto legitimize Indian and Pakistani possession of these weapons, just so long as they are not caught testing them. Such a policy sets a poor precedent--if one is worried that other countries, such as Iran and Iraq, might seek to withdraw from the NPT, and escape international opprobrium by signing on to the CTBT as a declared nuclear power. 
Instead, the Senate should demand that India and Pakistan join the NPT, and should insist on vigorous international sanctions against proliferant countries, to be lifted only after their nuclear programs have been rolled back. 
India's nuclear testing also is compelling, additional evidence pointing to the need for a national missile defense to protect the United States. Because India can readily reconfigure its space-launch vehicle as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), its actions clearly constitute an emerging nuclear threat to the United States. For this reason, it is time that the Foreign Relations Committee review the antiquated ABM Treaty, which precludes the United States from deploying a missile defense. Sad to say, the Specter amendment plays into the hands of those who seek to detract attention from this effort. 
Finally, Mr. President, India's (and Pakistan's) actions should make clear to all just how vital the U.S. nuclear deterrent is to the national security of the United States. What is needed, at this time, is not a scramble for an arms control treaty that prohibits the United States from guaranteeing the safety and reliability of its nuclear stockpile. What is needed is a careful, bottoms-up review of the state of the U.S. nuclear infrastructure, which I fear is in sad repair after six years of a moratorium. I expect that, after undertaking such a review, the United States will find that the CTBT is the very last thing the United States should consider doing. 
Mr. President, I do hope Senators will oppose the Specter amendment.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute has reported that for the week ending July 17 that the U.S. imported 8,750,000 barrels of oil each day, 605,000 barrels a day more than the 8,145,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 58.1 percent of their needs last week. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States imported about 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America s oil supply. 
All Americans should ponder the economic calamity certain to occur in the U.S. if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S.: now 8,750,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately $98,875,000 a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have asked for this time this morning because this is the last week I will be here for a while. As of a week from today, I will have traded in my 1921 knees for some 1998 models. And during the time that I will be absent, the credit union issue will come up before the Senate. Now, I could duck the issue and probably make out all right, but I do not operate that way, and I feel I should not merely lay out for the record my views about this piece of legislation, but I should speak them publicly so that they can be known. 
Mr. President, I suspect that most, if not all, Senators will agree that a certain type of democracy has, without question, been at work in terms of the astounding number of postcards and letters, faxes, telephone calls, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, from representatives of the credit union industry at all levels. It would be an understatement, in fact, to describe the deluge as merely an impressive campaign. It is far more than that. 
I have been around this place for quite a while, and I have spent many hours meeting with citizens on both sides of the credit union legislation that the Senate will shortly consider. I have seen North Carolinians who support H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act, and I have seen and visited with North Carolinians who are opposed to it. 
In any case, the supporters of this bill are an important segment of our community. Credit unions provide basic, efficient, and affordable financial services. And I have to say for the record that North Carolina's credit unions do good work in providing for the needs of countless of their fellow hard-working Tar Heels. 
Mr. President, it may be of interest to Senators from other States that this debate began in Randolph County, NC, which is the home of Richard Petty. And anybody who does not know who Richard Petty is, see me after I finish these remarks and I will fill them in on who Richard Petty is. 
In February of this year, after a 7-year court battle, the Supreme Court handed down its decision on the case titled National Credit Union Administration v. First National Bank & Trust Co., which was a lawsuit involving several North Carolina financial institutions. 
It may be that a bit of history will be useful at this point. Credit unions, as clarified in the preamble of the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934, were created by Congress `to make more available to people of small means credit for provident purposes.' 
In order to serve these individuals of `small means,' credit unions were awarded back then specific benefits that others did not have in connection with their carrying out a clearly defined purpose, which was to provide essential basic financial services. 
Now then, these benefits, including exemptions from Federal taxes and the extraordinarily burdensome Community Reinvestment Act, CRA, as it is known around this place--have 
enabled the credit union industry to serve their customers with a marketplace advantage--very clearly an advantage--not allowed to other insured depository competitors which must pay taxes and which must abide by complex Federal regulations, which credit unions do not have to do. 
In the early 1980s, the National Credit Union Administration used its regulatory power for significant alteration and expansion of the original intent of the Federal Credit Union Act. 
Specifically, in 1982, the NCUA allowed credit unions to expand their memberships to include multiple employer groups, an action which effectively eliminated the meaning of the common bond. This, in fact, was the precise holding of the Supreme Court's February 1998 decision. 
When this debate started, some shrewd Washington lobbyists--and that is about the best I can describe them--these lobbyists circulated the notion that the Supreme Court's intent was--now get this, Mr. President--the intent of the Supreme Court, they said, was to kick people out of their credit unions. 
But what happened? Credit union members promptly began calling and writing to me, and all other Senators, I am sure, pleading with us to protect their right to remain members of their credit unions. 
Mr. President, that of course never was in doubt, and these lobbyists knew it. But they struck fear in the hearts of the credit union members; hence the deluge of telephone calls and faxes and letters and visits and all the rest of it. 
In no way--let me say this as plainly as I can--in no way will these membership rights be revoked from citizens who were credit union account holders prior to the February 25, 1998, Supreme Court decision. I hope I have nailed down that falsehood pretty well. 
Parenthetically, Mr. President, it should be made clear that such revocation has never--never--been remotely considered by anybody. It would have been fundamentally unfair for anybody to even think of it. It should also be emphasized that the banking industry is unanimously supportive of the position that it would be unfair. 
Mr. President, I am persuaded that many Senators may have been incorrectly persuaded by the deluge of contacts with their constituents that small bankers are attempting to take away the account rights of credit union members, which, in fairness, Mr. President, is an absolute falsehood, and even the lobbyists who contend otherwise are bound to have known and know to this moment that it is false. 
Let the record be clear, nobody--nobody--has a membership in a credit union where that membership depends on passing legislation that will allow the unrestrained expansion of credit unions. 
Now, the fact is, most traditional credit unions were not, nor ever will be, affected by the Supreme Court decision of last February. The fact is, in that decision the Supreme Court supported the original statutory intent of the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 that credit unions must have a common bond, that is to say, some reason to be considered as a group. In fact, the Court was unanimous in its interpretation of the law, identical in effect to the way it was written way back in 1934. 
All right. You see, Mr. President, most credit unions operate under the definition of a `common bond,' 
as was clearly the intent of the Federal Credit Union Act. 
Mr. President, most credit unions will continue to operate and the members will continue to benefit from their regulatory tax-exempt status--taxes that their competitors have to pay. 
Now, the point is unmistakably clear. The only credit unions affected are credit unions that have expanded, in clear violation of the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 which the Court upheld this year. The violation of this Federal Credit Union Act has been done in several ways--primarily by the unlawful inclusion of hundreds of groups, large and small, and thousands upon thousands of employees of these hundreds of groups. 
Now, the change in the National Credit Union Administration regulatory policy launched the credit union industry into an era of unprecedented growth. For example, in the 8 months following the regulatory change, one credit union added more than 1,000 different groups. That was done in less than 8 months' time. 
No longer were credit unions required to represent groups of individuals with common workplace or geographic interests, but hundreds of unrelated groups not joined by any commonality. Larger credit unions have used this newfound freedom to an advantage at the expense of their financial competitors. 
This legislation--and the name of it, just for the Record, is the Credit Union Membership Access Act; the number is H.R. 1151--this legislation proposes to codify, to place into law, the NCUA 1982 regulatory interpretation and thereby invite another major expansion of the credit union industry. H.R. 1151 proposes to authorize multibonded credit unions to bring in groups of up to 3,000 members--a number, by the way, which NCUA can waive at its discretion--and would effectively allow credit unions to target every entity in the United States. 
Now, the Bureau of the Census has declared that 99.9 percent of the businesses in the United States employ fewer than 3,000 workers. So you see the practical effect of allowing multibonded credit unions to bring into their membership groups which have less than 3,000 members would effectively repeal all limits of expansion on the credit unions which pay no taxes. 
In summary, H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act, soon to be the pending business in the Senate, is a long way from the original concept and intent of the very clear common bond. According to the NCUA, to qualify for this tax-subsidized service--and that is what it is--one would simply have to walk in and sign up. It follows that many credit unions are moving beyond their original purpose of aiding individuals of `small means' with basic services. In fact, already such things as professional sports teams, yacht clubs, law firms, country clubs, and many, many others now have their own credit unions. I suggest that this exceeds any rational definition of individuals living by `small means.' 
In all fairness, the reason I am here this morning is H.R. 1151 does not qualify as simply a pro-credit union bill. It is really, if you want to call it what it is, an anti-competitiveness bill. If Congress wants to alter the intended dimensions of credit unions, Congress should be willing to say so clearly and not hide behind the guise--and that is what it is--that the intent of the soon-to-be pending legislation is to protect credit unions following the Supreme Court's ruling. 
Now, then, in realty, Congress is setting the stage for the expansion and growth of the credit union industry into thousands upon thousands of new markets well into the 21st century, while continuing to be exempt from paying the Federal taxes that the competitors down Main Street have to pay. 
If the credit union industry wants to expand its presence in the financial marketplace and increase its ability to offer various services to more and more groups--in short, if they want to operate like community banks--I commend their ambition because I believe that the banking industry will and should welcome them into the marketplace as long as credit unions are required to live under the very same tax structure and the very same regulatory morass that America's small community banks and small town bankers live with every day. 
Let me be clear, as I wind up, that I oppose both higher taxes and burdensome regulation. If Congress chooses to allow credit union growth without taxation and without costly regulations, then let's be fair and do the same for America's community bankers, the small bankers who are competing for the same core of business without the benefit of a Federal subsidy paid by the American taxpayer. 
It is unfortunate that the debate on this legislation up to now has pitted the banking interests versus the interests of the credit union industry. The debate should be about the willingness of Congress to provide a level and fair playing field for all financial interests. Is it equitable for credit unions, comprised of countless hundreds of groups and assets in the billions, to have a competitive advantage over small bankers who are competing for the same business? I am convinced the obvious answer to that is no. Unless and until this becomes a debate about fairness in the marketplace instead of a politically expedient response to a shrewd and energetic lobbying campaign, I cannot and will not support such misguided and tragically misunderstood legislation. 
In closing, a few personal observations: Earlier, I mentioned the enormous public relations campaign crafted by lobbyists for the credit union industry. I am confident that every Senator's office has experienced this full court press. 
This past week, in fact, a rally was staged right here on Capitol Hill by several thousand credit union supporters who had been brought to Washington to demand immediate passage of H.R. 1151, without amendments. 
Now, I am genuinely impressed by the willingness of the credit union industry's supporters to travel to Washington to express their support for H.R. 1151. However, I must question the actions of some of the lobbyists who staged this demonstration on the Capitol steps and used distortion and half-truths and even untruths to get their message across. This undermines the integrity of the people who they purport to represent. I hope in the future they will use greater care in representing their constituencies. 
So this debate boils down to an issue of fairness. Most Senators, including myself, have friends on both sides. I take great care in trying to ensure that the small guy, whether he is a bank customer or a credit union member, is given a fair and equal deal, the level playing field that we so often hear so much about. This bill does not represent a level playing field. Congress amended the Federal Credit Union Act in 1937 to give tax-exempt status to federally chartered credit unions to serve a narrow purpose, not to give a distinct market advantage over their competition with the small bank down the street. 
Now, it must be said that many credit unions such as the U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union, right here on Capitol Hill, have used this advantage judiciously in serving their clearly defined customer base. 
The employees of the Senate are their customer base. They won't lose their membership. Nobody is about to lose their membership. That is all hogwash. Unfortunately, too many other large credit unions have expanded the reach of their tax-exempt status far beyond the original congressional intent--extending their Government-subsidized services to include hundreds upon hundreds of unrelated groups and businesses. 
I say again, as a result of this tax-free status and their exemption from Federal regulations that require other financial institutions to reinvest in low-income areas, credit unions are able to offer deals on loan rates and checking accounts that most community banks simply cannot match. 
It gives me no pleasure to stand here and take this stand, Mr. President. I could have kept silent and gone on down to North Carolina to have my sore knees fixed. But I am obliged to say, in conclusion, that if we allow credit unions to expand tax free and act more and more like banks, then we should at least try to ensure that there is a level playing field for all similar financial institutions. If we tax the banking industry, the small bankers, we should tax the credit unions--but I don't think we should tax either one of them. If we are to force banks to function under burdensome community reinvestment regulations, shouldn't we support equally demanding regulations for credit unions? Is this not, in the final analysis, just an issue of fairness? It would be simpler and easier for me to keep silent, but my conscience would not let me do so. I cannot engage in that luxury. I felt obliged to take my stand and I have done so. 
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as has been made clear, this amendment is a version of a bill offered last week by Senators McConnell, Biden, and others. At that time, Senators felt pressure to lift sanctions on India and Pakistan, thereby precluding U.S. companies from participating in a significant wheat tender. 
I understood the urgency, and I therefore supported my colleagues. On the question of sanctions in general, and sanctions on India and Pakistan in particular, however, several points need to be emphasized. 
The sanctions tasks force appointed by the majority and minority leaders, as of last week's sanctions relief bill, had met twice at a staff level. No one saw the proposed bill language, which, as originally written, would have lifted not only economic, but also military and dual use sanctions on India and Pakistan for a period of nine months. 
Mr. President, I believe the majority leader was serious in his desire to constitute a group of Senators who, after due deliberation, would make recommendations on sanctions. That did not happen. Instead, we have rushed forward, willy nilly, with bills and amendments that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has not considered. Indeed, last week we were presented with language that even the members of the sanctions task force had not considered. 
It is my firm belief that at any given time we have one Commander in Chief and one Secretary of State. I support the President's right to make decisions on foreign policy, even when I disagree with those decisions. I also agree that it is important that the President have some flexibility in making those decisions. 
That is why I am willing to support a limited waiver on economic sanctions--economic sanctions only--for nine months for India and Pakistan--which I do with some reservations. I shall expand on this further at another time. Suffice it to say that I do not believe foreign aid, foreign loan guarantees or international bail outs are an `entitlement' to any nation. 
Equally importantly, Mr. President, no nation deserves military hardware, services or dual use items capable of supporting military programs if and when that nation engages in conduct dangerous to the national security of the United States. I shall never support U.S. supercomputers going to help the Indian nuclear program or U.S. space technology supporting a South Asian missile program. The line must be drawn somewhere. 
The bill presented to me last Thursday at 9:30 a.m., one hour prior to its consideration by the full Senate, would have allowed anything--munitions list items, aircraft, weapons, advanced weapons technology--to go to India or Pakistan. I refuse to believe that even those most ardent to appease big business could countenance a U.S. military relationship with a nation that just detonated a nuclear weapon. 
Mr. President, sanctions have their downsides, and I am ready to address those downsides. What I am not willing to do is to permit Congress to rush headlong into approving legislation which would open the floodgates to the rogues of this world.

Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, I rise in respectful opposition to some of the implications of the amendment offered by my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar. Now, we all know that sanctions have come under assault of late. It is the politically correct thing to do amidst Senator Lugar's and my friends in the business community. And I think neither Senator Lugar nor I has failed to stand up for the free enterprise system and the business community when the community deserved to be supported, which is most of the time. 
Nevertheless, there are some powerful corporate interests in this town which have launched a well-financed lobbying campaign against sanctions, all sanctions, in an obvious attempt to convince Congress that all sorts of unreasonable sanction laws have been presented and that these sanctions are something new and unusual and somehow detrimental to the best interests of this country. 
On that point I beg to differ. The fact is, as an effective and principled foreign policy tool economic sanctions are older than this Republic itself. What did the American colonies do in response to Britain's imposition of the Stamp Act? The American colonies imposed economic sanctions forcing its repeal as a matter of fact. What did the Continental Congress do when Britain imposed the Intolerable Acts? The Continental Congress imposed economic sanctions on Britain. 
Why has Congress always authorized sanctions when needed? This is a question that is worth reviewing, and that is what I propose to do briefly, if it may be possible. Amazingly, some in the business community, and they have always been and will continue to be close friends of mine, have jumped to the conclusion on the recent events in India and Pakistan to pursue their attacks on the U.S. bilateral sanctions. But it is precisely those events in India and Pakistan, the decision by these governments to detonate a dozen separate nuclear weapons, that should heighten our resolve to enforce tough sanctions against governments that seek to destabilize the world. 
The fact is, in that instance, Madam President, I believe, and I believe I can demonstrate, that India detonated its devices because of India's fear that the United States was coddling China and bidding friendship for China that ought not to be a part of the foreign policy of this country. 
Now, just weeks ago the Senate passed the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act by an overwhelming vote of 90 to 4. Why did we do that? In order to place a cost on the specific companies for transferring dangerous missile technology to a terrorist regime in Iran which will use that technology to destabilize the entire Persian Gulf region. 
Now, we authorize the President to sanction states and foreign companies that threaten the safety of the American people by spreading nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction. We authorize sanctions on states, and when I say the word `states,' I mean governments, foreign governments, which provide training, weapons and political or financial and diplomatic support to terrorists who kidnap and murder American citizens. We authorize sanctions on governments involved in the smuggling and transshipment of illegal drugs that poison our children. We authorize sanctions on governments that commit acts of genocide and armed aggression against their neighbors and crimes against humanity. 
The question must be faced: Are we unreasonable in doing this? Should we be ashamed? I do not think so. Obviously, sanctions are not always the answer. I do not contend that they are, but we cannot escape the fact that sometimes they are the only answer. 
I think we better face the facts. There are only three basic tools in foreign policy. There is diplomacy, sanctions, and war. Without sanctions, where would we be? Our options with the dictators and proliferators and terrorists of this world would be three: empty talk, sending in the Marines, or withdrawing into isolation. And I for one am not willing to place such artificial limits on our foreign policy options. 
But this is exactly, I fear, what the pending amendment proposes to do. Perhaps the Senator from Indiana can persuade me and the remainder, the rest of the Senate that that is not intended and at least make some statements for the Record that can be viewed in the future. 
In practice, this amendment is not about sanctions reform as it states. It is an obvious attempt by opponents of sanctions and the business community to hamstring Congress' ability to authorize sanctions. The proposed amendment would tie Congress' hands with mandatory waiting periods for the implementation of all sanctions, require mandatory sunsets on all future sanctions laws and define a wide range of congressional actions known or referred to as `sanctions' when they are nothing of the sort. 
This amendment, I fear, would impose a mandatory 2-year time limit on all U.S. sanctions law. I'm afraid that would be opening a Pandora's box. Imagine if this was the law of the land when the United States enacted the Arms Export Control Act which prohibits the sale of sophisticated weapons to nations that the State Department determines annually support terrorism--governments like Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya and North Korea. Would we have wanted those sanctions to be eliminated under an arbitrary 2-year timetable? I think not. 
Further, what exactly is meant by the term `sanctions'? The pending amendment, it seems to me, breaks new ground on what henceforth would be considered a `sanction.' Under this amendment, it seems to me, the denial of U.S. foreign aid would be deemed a sanction. Any conditionality on U.S. funding to the World Bank or the IMF would be a `sanction' on a foreign government. And let me remind Senators that since it was created in 1945, American taxpayers have anted up billions of dollars for the World Bank and now the antisanctions crowd tells us that we can't place any conditions on the expenditures of those funds. 
According to a recent report by the USIA, the conditions placed by Congress on U.S. foreign aid to the Palestinian Liberation Organization are a `sanction.' Really? Conditioning U.S. foreign aid to the PLO--an organization whose modus operandi for most of its existence has been killing innocent civilians--is now deemed a sanction? 
What this amendment, I fear, proposes to do is to enshrine U.S. foreign aid giveaways as an entitlement, an entitlement to foreign countries. 
Wait one moment before jumping to conclusions. While this amendment expands the definition of sanctions to absurd proportions, it doesn't cover all sanctions. Oh, no. You see, our friends in the business community--and they are my friends, and they are Senator Lugar's friends--and their lobbyists who helped write this amendment have quietly carved out an exemption for bilateral sanctions they like--sanctions that directly benefit them. The same folks who are busy telling us that sanctions don't work and should be scrapped, have ensured that certain retaliatory trade sanctions are exempt from the restrictions of this legislation. 
The way some in the business community have influenced the crafting of this amendment, Congress would be hamstrung in implementing sanctions against any nation that poses a threat to the safety of the American people, even if a government proliferates dangerous weapons of mass destruction, commits genocide, or supports terrorists responsible for murdering American citizens. But, if they flood the American market with cheap television sets--whoa, that is a different proposition. We can throw the book at them. 
Under this amendment, the President would be prohibited from implementing sanctions against any country for at least 45 days, supposedly under the guise of a `cooling off' period. On the surface, that sounds pretty reasonable. But in practice, a 2-month lapse is not only foolish, it can be downright dangerous. 
One example--after the Libyan terrorists blew up Pan Am flight 103, murdering 263 innocent citizens in cold blood, the United Nations spent months and months debating appropriate actions against Libya. Meanwhile, Libya divested itself of most reachable assets in order to avoid the impact of sanctions. So the pending amendment would essentially afford other terrorist states the same courtesy. While the United States `cools off' for 45 days, the terrorists, the proliferators, the genocidal dictators, would have 2 months to quietly divest their finances and conceal the evidence and provide safe haven for fugitives. That strikes me as being something short of reform. 
The pending amendment would not place these requirements on multilateral sanctions. Of course, multilateral sanctions are more effective than bilateral sanctions. But, should the United States be handcuffed to the will, or more likely the lack of will, of the so-called international community? Should we tie our hands to the whims of our European `allies'--and I put quotation marks around allies because their slumping welfare state economies are driving them to employ increasingly mercantilist foreign policies. 
Right now the United States is waging a lonely battle at the United Nations to stop our allies from caving in and lifting U.N. sanctions on Iraq. If it were up to the French and the Russians, international business would be rushing headlong into Baghdad to renew commercial ties with Saddam Hussein, notwithstanding his continued defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors. Yet, we should give these people a veto over our national security policy that was won through the sacrifice and courage and blood of American men and women just 7 years ago? 
I believe we need sanctions reform. One reform we might consider is requiring that the sanctions which Congress passes would be actually implemented. Not long ago, Congress passed the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act--a targeted law much of whose language, I might add, was drafted by the Clinton administration itself. Live on CNN, the President signed it into law with great pomp and circumstance. But then, when the time came to implement that law, the President lost his nerve and the U.S. foreign policy suffered yet another devastating loss of credibility. 
The distinguished majority leader, Mr. Lott, and the Senate minority leader, Mr. Daschle, have established a bipartisan `sanctions reform task force' to determine if, as critics have complained, Congress has gone `sanctions mad.' This, in my view, is a wise plan, and I serve on that task force; the Senator from Indiana serves on it, as does Senator Glenn and other interested Senators from both parties. The first question we are seeking to answer is, What is a sanction? In fact, we are having a hearing planned for July 31 to study this and other questions. 
In conclusion, Madam President, instead of rushing forward with any sort of ill-considered amendment--and I say that as respectfully as possible--the ramifications of which are unknown to most Senators, we should let that task force do its work and consider ways Congress can strengthen its consideration of proposed sanctions laws. 
Those who are prone to criticize the `impulsive' actions of the U.S. Senate, actions which I happen to believe are motivated by a devotion to the security of this country and its people, should themselves be wary of impulsive `one-size-fits-all' solutions such as this amendment. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the premise of the amendment proposed by the distinguished Senator from Indiana is that--as President Clinton recently put it--the United States has gone `sanctions happy.' We've all heard the statistics, repeated without question by the media, that the United States has enacted sanctions 61 times in just 4 years, thereby placing 42% of the world's population under the oppressive yoke of U.S. sanctions. 
Well, it just ain't so. 
I've examined these so-called statistics. And I've found that they are fabricated. The `61-sanctions' figure, which came from a study by the National Association of Manufacturers, and circulate widely by an anti-sanctions business coalition calling itself `USA Engage.' 
The NAM claims that, over a 4 year period (1993 through 1996) `61 U.S. laws and executive actions were enacted authorizing unilateral economic sanctions for foreign policy purposes.' According to NAM, these sanctions have targeted 35 countries, over 2.3 billion people (42% of the world's population) and $790 billion--19% of the world's total--in export markets. 
NAM lists a catalogue of 20 new laws passed by Congress and 41 Executive Branch actions for a total of 61 new sanctions in just 4 years. 
The `61 sanctions' figure cries out for examination. I asked the Congressional Research Service to analyze the NAM claim. After examining the NAM study, CRS reported to me, `We could not defensibly subdivide or catagorize the entries in the (NAM) catalogue so that they add up to 61.' 
How did NAM come up with this 61-sanctions claim? Here's how: 
The National Association of Manufacturers includes as examples of `unilateral economic sanctions' every time the U.S. complied with U.N. Security Council sanctions--which are, by definition, multilateral sanctions; 
The NAM used double-, triple- and quadruple-counts certain sanctions; 
They included as a so-called `sanction' any executive branch or Congressional actions denying, limiting or even conditioning U.S. foreign aid. (Since when, I ask, did foreign aid become an entitlement?) 
The NAM lists as sanctions instances where no sanctions were actually imposed, cases sanctions were actually lifted, and cases where sanctions were imposed briefly and then lifted. 
The NAM piled into their `sanctions' list any decision to bar the sale of lethal military equipment to terrorist states, and various actions which affect just a single corporate entity or individuals--not countries. 
Mr. President, this is not what most of us have in mind when we think of `sanctions.' We think of trade bans and embargoes on states--not seizing the assets of Colombian drug traffickers, blocking imports from a single factory in southern China which is using prison labor, or banning the sale of lethal equipment to states which arm and train terrorists. 
The fact is, there is no credible way to argue that the U.S. has imposed 61 sanctions in just four years, or that anywhere near 42% of the world's population has been targeted by U.S. sanctions. In other words, there is no basis for the claim that we in Congress have gone `sanctions happy' or for the problem that the amendment offered by the Senator from Indiana proposes to fix.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as the review of the NAM study makes clear, most of these actions were taken at the President's discretion, either by Executive Order or based a law where President had broad waiver authority. 
If the Senate is going to have a debate over sanctions policy, we should do so on the basis of facts, not distortions presented by the anti-sanctions lobby. That is the reason that the Republican and Democratic leaderships have formed a bipartisan sanctions task force to examine the facts, and make recommendations. 
Apparently, some in the business community would prefer for the Senate to act before the facts come out. We should not fall for such tactics. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in the rush to end sanctions, I find it incredible that some of our colleagues appear willing to forgive and forget the conduct of regimes like those in Iran, Iraq, Libya, Cuba, Sudan, and North Korea. 
The inescapable impression is that they are willing--I hope unwittingly--to cast aside U.S. laws designed to ensure that U.S. taxpayers' money will not be sent to regimes that proliferate weapons of mass destruction, or smuggle drugs over our borders, or promote acts of terrorism around the world. 
More disheartening is an apparent willingness to abandon the Cuban people to the brutality of Fidel Castro. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that the Majority Leader has taken the initiative to create the Sanctions Task Force, of which I am a member. That bipartisan group has been tasked with studying sanctions in a deliberate process and produce recommendations for the consideration of the Senate. 
Rather than wait for that careful review, Senator Dodd has offered an amendment today that would have the effect of undermining existing sanctions on rogue states. 
Mr. President, there should be no mistake about Senator Dodd's seeking to undermine the U.S. embargo of Fidel Castro's regime. So eager is the Senator to achieve this end, that he is willing to blow a hole in all other U.S.-supported embargoes as well. That is what the Senator's amendment would do. 
The Senator's amendment is based on the mistaken notion that people in Cuba go without food and medicine due to U.S. sanctions. The facts paint a very different picture. Cubans have been impoverished by a failed Communist economy. Moreover, Castro denies his own people such necessities as a means of keeping them under his thumb. But, he makes state-of-the-art medical care available to Communist party cronies and foreign tourists who provide hard currency to his regime. 
Mr. President, U.S. and multilateral sanctions routinely contemplate humanitarian needs of the people in these countries. In the case of Cuba, U.S. law currently permits the sale of medicines and the donation of food and other humanitarian necessities. Indeed, just since 1992, Americans have provided about $2.3 billion in aid directly to the Cuban people. 
The comprehensive trade embargo on Iran allows for humanitarian donations to be sent. Even with North Korea, the U.S. has been able to accommodate humanitarian needs without loosening the restrictions in other areas. 
In Iraq, the food-for-oil agreement allows humanitarian aid to flow. Our Treasury Department also licenses the donation and sale of these items. 
The bottom-line is that the Dodd amendment is not good for the Cuban people or any other country--including our own. Therefore it is imperative that the Torricelli second degree amendment be approved by the Senate. 
In Cuba, as with other countries, there are reasonable, pro-active steps that we can take to promote the liberation of the people and, in the mean time, provide humanitarian assistance. But, we should do this without letting up the pressure on the tyrants who torment their own people. 
Mr. President, in closing, I am persuaded that it is not and never will be in the interest of the United States of America to relax pressure on governments that promote terrorism, destabilize regions with their aggression, proliferate nuclear weapons technology, and enslave their own people. Therefore, I urge that the pending Torricelli second degree amendment be approved overwhelmingly.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute has reported that for the week ending July 3 that the U.S. imported 7,328,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,632,000 barrels a day less than the 8,960,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
While this is one of the rare weeks when Americans imported slightly less foreign oil than the same week a year ago, Americans still relied on foreign oil for 53.7 percent of their needs last week. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States imported about 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
All Americans should ponder the economic calamity certain to occur in the U.S. if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S.: now 7,328,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately $80,608,830 a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it is an exciting development that the electrical cooperatives in North Carolina are improving public education and the quality of classroom instruction without spending a dime of the taxpayer's money. 
Since 1994, the electrical cooperatives in my state have sponsored a grant program for teachers called `Bright Ideas', and it has been a roaring success--encouraging creative teaching by awarding grants of up to $2,000 to K-12 teachers in annual competitions. There is no restriction on subject matter to apply; in fact, Mr. President, teachers are not required to teach in a cooperative service area to compete. 
Teachers need only to show that they are using original, innovative ideas to improve the education of young people. These new teaching methods range from reading and music programs to creative math and science programs; from research involving computers and video technology to career-oriented programs to prepare teenagers for the working world. 2,000 teachers applied to cooperatives for grants this year, and more than 400 classrooms in North Carolina became `Bright Ideas' classrooms. 
Mr. President, North Carolina's electric cooperatives operate in 93 of our 100 counties, providing power to almost a quarter of our state's population. Most members of these cooperatives aren't walking around with deep-pockets. They're hard-working folks in rural areas who recognize the value of a good education. 
The `Bright Ideas' program initiated by these fine people continues to flourish. In 1994, North Carolina's electric cooperatives authorized a collaborative statewide effort and allocated $225,000 annually for Bright Ideas for a five-year period. But a funny thing happened, Mr. President. These grants proved so successful that individual cooperatives are getting into the act and supplementing already allocated funds with money of their own. Their initiative will allow the cooperatives to award more than $1 million dollars in grants a full year ahead of schedule. 
In fact, Chuck Terrill, Executive Vice-President and CEO of the North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation says that `Bright Ideas' grants for North Carolina's school will top $1.5 million by the end of the 1998-1999 school year. 
Mr. President, `Bright Ideas' is just one of the many ways the members of North Carolina's electric cooperatives help their communities and support their public schools. I congratulate them for seeing a need and providing precious resources to challenge the children in North Carolina's classrooms.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute has reported that for the week ending June 19 that the U.S. imported 7,883,000 barrels of oil each day, more than a quarter million (253,000) barrels a day more than the 7,630,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 55.5 percent of their needs last week. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States imported about 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
All Americans should ponder the economic calamity certain to occur in the U.S. if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S: now 7,883,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately $78,908,830 a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reported for the week ending June 12 that the U.S. imported 8,862,000 barrels of oil each day, 529,000 barrels a day less than the 9,391,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
While this is one of the rare weeks when Americans imported slightly less foreign oil than the same week a year ago, Americans still relied on foreign oil for 58.4 percent of their needs last week. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States imported about 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Politicians should give consideration to the economic calamity certain to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S: now 9,532,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately $99,431,640 a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1415, the tobacco legislation. There are several amendments still pending to the bill, and it is hoped those issues can be disposed of at an early hour so that the Senate can consider additional amendments to the tobacco bill. 
Rollcall votes, therefore, are expected throughout today's session of the Senate. As a reminder to all Members, there are a number of items that the Senate may also resume, or begin, or both, including the Department of Defense authorization bill, the conference reports as they may become available, and any appropriations bills that are ready for action. As always, other executive or legislative matters may be considered as they are cleared. 
On behalf of the majority leader, I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with respect to the tobacco legislation the debate be in order only until 10:30 this morning.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reported for the week ending May 29, that the U.S. imported 8,549,000 barrels of oil each day, an increase of 175,000 barrels a day over the 8,374,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 57.2 percent of their needs last week. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Politicians had better give consideration to the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S: now 8,549,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it was about four months ago that I called the Senate's distinguished chaplain and suggested that he might consider inviting Rev. Shirley Caesar of Raleigh, North Carolina, to serve as the U.S. Senate's guest chaplain on some mutually convenient occasion. 
I recall Dr. Ogilvie's response--a friendly suggestion that I tell him about Pastor Caesar. I replied that I would do better than that--and I did, by sending Dr. Ogilvie a copy of a lengthy article published by the Washington Post on February 22.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, when Jimmy Stewart died last July, less than a year shy of his 90th birthday, which would have been today, millions of Americans of all ages felt they had lost a dear friend. They had grown up with great films such as `It's a Wonderful Life,' `Harvey,' `The Philadelphia Story,' and the one that's probably many Americans' personal favorite, `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.' 
I was fortunate to get to work with Mr. Stewart during the 1970s when we were on the campaign trail across North Carolina. Dot and I will never forget travelling with him introducing him to the citizens who felt that they already knew him. 
Perhaps what I like most about `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is the manner in which Jimmy Stewart and director Frank Capra captured the timeless principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence. In describing the them of the picture, Capra said: `The more uncertain are the people of the world, the more their hard-won freedoms are scattered and lost in the winds of change, the more they need a ringing statement of America's democratic ideals.' 
Jimmy Stewart, Mr. President, in a sense was playing a character modeled after Abe Lincoln. According to Capra, Jefferson Smith was `tailored to the rail-splitter's simplicity, compassion, ideals, humor and unswerving moral courage under pressure.' 
A year ago, on the occasion of Jimmy Stewart's eighty-ninth birthday, John Meroney of Advance, N.C., wrote a Wall Street Journal essay, `A Hero Larger Than Those He Portrayed,' celebrating Jimmy Stewart's life and career. I learned about John Meroney when he was a student at Wake Forest University. I am persuaded the reason Jimmy Stewart appeals to John and other young people isn't simply because Mr. Stewart made some of the greatest pictures of all-time. I believe, Mr. President, that it's the contrast between Jimmy Stewart and so many of those who live and work in Hollywood today. It's hard to imagine anyone out there capturing America's heart the way Jimmy Stewart did, and via his countless films, still does. It's as John Meroney put it, it isn't because Jimmy played great characters. It's because of the way Jimmy Stewart lived his life.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, immediately upon his return from Cuba, Pope John Paul II gave an audience at the Vatican where he discussed his historic Cuban pilgrimage. While Fidel Castro and others were working hard to distort the purpose of his visit, the Pope was unambiguous about the aims and purposes of his visit in Cuba. 
His Holiness said: `I wish for our brothers and sisters on that beautiful island that the fruits of this pilgrimage will be similar to the fruits of that pilgrimage in Poland,' referring to his June 1979 visit to his native Poland--a visit which is widely credited with inspiring the Polish people to throw off the shackles of their oppression, and embrace their God-given spiritual and political freedom. 
That visit marked the beginning of the end for Poland's communist dictatorship--just as, I believe, the Pope's historic visit to Cuba has marked the beginning of the end of Fidel Castro's despotic rule. 
With his Cuban pilgrimage, John Paul II has sown the seeds of spiritual and political liberation in the Cuban mind. The United States must now help the Cuban people to cultivate those seeds of liberation which His Holiness had planted in Cuba--just as the United States worked with him in helping the Polish people in their struggle against communist oppression nearly two decades ago. 
That is why today--along with more than 20 of my Senate colleagues--I am introducing legislation that will bring new energy and focus to the U.S. Cuba policy--`The Cuban Solidarity Act of 1998' or `SOLIDARIDAD' Act. 
The buttons we are all wearing may look familiar to many watching today. Our buttons bear the logo of the Polish Solidarity movement--but with a Cuban twist. You see, we are calling this legislation the `Cuban Solidarity Act' for a reason. Our goal is to do today for the people of Cuba, what the United States did for the Solidarity movement in Poland during the 1980s: Give the Cuban people the resources they need to build a free, functioning civil society within the empty shell of Castro's bankrupt communist `revolution.' 
The Cuban Solidarity Act proposes to authorize $100 million over four years in U.S. government humanitarian assistance to the Cuban people--donations of food and medicine, to be delivered through the Catholic Church and truly independent relief organizations in Cuba like Caritas. 
The legislation we are introducing today will authorize direct humanitarian flights to deliver both private and U.S. government donations to Cuba. And it will mandate a proactive U.S. policy to support the internal opposition in Cuba, just as the U.S. supported the Solidarity movement in Poland during the 1980s. 
This legislation is not about the Cuban embargo. It does not tighten the embargo; it does not loosen the embargo. What it does is add a new dimension to the U.S. policy regarding Cuba: With the enactment of this legislation, U.S. policy will no longer be simply to isolate the Castro regime, but to actively support those working to bring about change inside Cuba. 
As Secretary of State Madeline Albright recently put it, there are two embargoes in Cuba today: The U.S. embargo on the Castro regime, and Castro's embargo on his own people. We must, Secretary Albright said, maintain the first, while breaking the second. 
This legislation is designed to break Fidel Castro's brutal embargo on the Cuban people. The Cuban Solidarity Act has four central objectives: 
First, this bill will provide free food and medicine to Cubans most in need--those who cannot possibly afford to buy the necessities of life because they have no access to U.S. dollars. 
Second, it will strengthen those institutions delivering this aid by giving them the resources they need to expand their space in Cuba and nurture a nascent civil society on the island. 
Third, this bill will undermine the Castro regime's ability to stifle dissent through the denial of work and basic necessities. In Cuba today, anyone who dares to speak out against Castro's despotic rule can lose his or her job (or be thrown in jail) and thus lose their ability to feed their families. This bill will help undermine Castro's ability to maintain social control through deprivation, by helping build alternative sources of food and medicine in Cuba. 
And finally, this bill will take away Fidel Castro's excuses, by neutralizing Castro's propaganda which falsely blames the U.S. embargo for the hardships suffered by the Cuban people. 
This legislation puts Castro in a no-win situation. There is no way for him to be on the right side of denying the Cuban people access to free food and medicine from the United States. 
If Castro allows this food and medicine into Cuba, it will bring relief to millions of Cubans who cannot afford to buy basic necessities; it will remove his ability to use deprivation as a tool of oppression; and it will help independent institutions create space for themselves in Cuba society. 
But if he does not allow the food and medicine in, them 11 million Cubans will know exactly who is responsible for their daily suffering. They will know that the American people wanted to send them $100 million in food and medicine, but that Castro said `No'. 
In addition to this humanitarian relief, the Cuban Solidarity Act also instructs the President to take a series of steps intended to hasten the liberation of the Cuban people. Among other provisions: 
The bill instructs the President to increase all forms of U.S. government support for `democratic opposition groups in Cuba,' who risk life and limb each day to challenge the regime. 
The bill also urges the President to seek a U.N. Security Council resolution calling on Fidel Castro to `immediately respect all human rights, free all political prisoners, legalize independent political parties, allow independent trade unions, and conduct freely contested elections.' 
The Cuban Solidarity Act also calls for creative measures to overcome Castro's blockade on information coming into Cuba instructing the President to commence `freedom broadcasting' through Radio and TV Marti from the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo, and other suitable sites around Cuba. 
The bill also requires the Administration to produce a series of reports on the plight of average Cubans, including conditions of human rights, workers' rights, and the apparent policy of coercing abortions among poor, less-educated Cuban women. 
And the bill will authorize increased personnel in the Treasury and Commerce Departments to facilitate licenses for American medical sales to Cuba--which have been fully legal since 1992--taking away Castro's excuses for his failure to provide American medicine and medical equipment for his people. 
The Cuban Solidarity Act is a bill that could and should be supported by all U.S. Senators, those for the Cuban embargo, and those opposed. 
All of us should unite behind a policy of providing free food and medicine to those trapped in Castro's Orwellian economy. I cannot imagine that anyone would disagree with the notion that the United States should bring the same intense commitment to its Cuba policy that made the difference in Poland's struggle with communist tyranny. 
Now some have suggested that we should not give the Cuban people free food and medicine--rather, we should sell it to them. My question is this: What exactly will they use to buy this American food and medicine? Soviet rubles? 
The Cuban people can't afford to buy American food and medicine! Today, in Cuba, food and medicine is available everywhere. In Havana, there are bakeries overflowing with fresh bread, pharmacies stocked with Western medicines, grocery stores brimming with foods. But these products are completely out of reach to most Cubans. 
Why? Castro allows them to be sold only for dollars, which the vast majority of Cubans don't have. Castro pays them in worthless Cuban pesos. The only Cubans who can afford to shop in these exclusive stores are cronies of the Castro regime, and those few lucky Cubans who get dollars from abroad--or those poor Cuban women and girls who are forced to prostitute themselves to foreign tourists from Canada and Europe in order to survive. 
Instead of trading with the Castro regime (and thus subsidizing the brutal state security apparatus which keeps him in power), our call today is: Let us unite to circumvent this monstrous system Castro has built; Let's give food and medicine directly to the Cuban people. 
The Cuban Solidarity Act will also encourage and facilitate increased private donations to Cuba. There are many in the private sector who have been enormously generous in their humanitarian efforts for the Cuban people, and we will be encouraging them to redouble their efforts. 
But we will also be issuing a challenge to all of our big-hearted friends in the corporate community who have been lobbying to lift the Cuban embargo. Since they claim to have so much concern for the Cuban people, we will be asking them: What are you willing to donate to help suffering Cubans who cannot afford to buy food and medicine for themselves? We'll see if the floodgates of generosity open up, showing corporate America's concern for Cuba's suffering people. 
Fidel Castro will never change his stripes. The Cuban Solidarity Act is based on the belief that we must do more than wait for Fidel Castro to die or `get religion.' We must do what was done for Lech Walesa and his courageous Polish brothers; that is, we must undertake a proactive policy under which the United States will lend decisive support to the cause of freedom in Cuba. 
The Pope's visit planted the seeds of liberation in Cuba. The Cuban Solidarity Act is the American people's way of cultivating those seeds for the benefit of Cubans and freedom-loving people everywhere. 
Let's get about it.

Twenty-five years ago, May 8, 1973, the federal debt stood at $452,712,000,000 (Four hundred fifty-two billion, seven hundred twelve million) which reflects a debt increase of more than $5 trillion--$5,033,157,171,398.56 (Five trillion, thirty-three billion, one hundred fifty-seven million, one hundred seventy-one thousand, three hundred ninety-eight dollars and fifty-six cents) during the past 25 years.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am grateful to the able Chairman of the Finance Committee (Mr. Roth), and to the distinguished ranking member (Mr. Moynihan) for their hard work and perseverance in bringing this IRS Reform legislation before the full Senate. 
For a very long time, it has been obvious that the Internal Revenue Service has a warped view of its intended role in the lives of Americans. The IRS exists, of course, not to harass any taxpayer or to find new and creative ways to abuse its authority, but to serve the American people who, each year, fill the coffers of the U.S. Treasury. 
The recent hearings held by the Finance Committee have made it crystal clear that the Internal Revenue Service is an abysmal failure in carrying out its mission. Frankly, I don't know whether to be more horrified by out-of-control IRS agents pursuing innocent taxpayers out of personal spite or double-dealing senior IRS managers trying to cover up such malicious conduct. 
It hardly matters which is worse, because even one abuse of taxpayer rights at and by the IRS is one abuse too many. So I am pleased that Congress is taking this modest action to make sure the worm turns. For the first time in a long time, the Senate appears ready to put the interests of the taxpayer above the demands of the federal bureaucracy for more and more revenue. 
And while I support this measure as a first step in the long road toward a more respectful treatment of the hapless American taxpayer, I trust that it is indeed only the beginning, because the root cause of all of the shenanigans at the IRS is the byzantine complexity of a U.S. tax code crying out for reform. 
Some years ago--in March of 1982, to be exact-- I introduced my initial proposal for a flat tax on income. This proposal, and other flat tax proposals that have followed, would eliminate the huge bureaucracy of the IRS--a bureaucracy whose size and scope make the abuses uncovered by Senator Roth and the Finance Committee as predictable as they are inevitable. 
I believe in the flat tax, and so do, Mr. President, the American people. A Money magazine poll released in January of this year indicated nearly two-thirds of Americans prefer a flat tax to our current system. I salute my colleagues, especially my distinguished friend from Alabama (Mr. Shelby), for their courage in continuing to make the case for tax simplification. 
And lest you think I'm overstating the absolute travesty that is the United State Tax Code, Mr. President, there's something that you and 
every other American should read. Dan Mitchell, one of the bright young economists who works around the corner at The Heritage Foundation, recently released a paper entitled `737, 734, 941, 858 Reasons. . . and Still Counting: Why a Flat Tax is Needed to Reform the IRS.' 
Mr. President, I do not exaggerate in saying that the statistics contained in this paper boggle the mind. Take note with me of just a couple of examples Mr. Mitchell has compiled to detail the economic cost of the tax code: 
 The private sector spends $157 billion dollars to comply with income tax laws. 
 The federal government spends $13.7 billion in, yes, taxpayer money to collect--what else?--taxpayer money. 
 It takes an estimated 5.4 billion hours for Americans to comply with federal tax forms. In fact, the IRS itself estimates that it takes almost 11 hours to fill out a 1040 form. 
Then there's the sheer amount of paperwork required every time the law changes. Mr. Mitchell reports the following: 
 There are 5,557,000 words in the income tax laws and regulations. That's 17,000 pages of paper. And get this: 820 additional pages were added to the tax code by the 1997 budget act. 
 The IRS sends out an estimated 8 billion pages of forms and instructions to taxpayers annually. For my colleagues who are particularly interested in the environment, they should know that 293,760 trees were needed to supply the paper.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the pending legislation in the Senate is obviously not a panacea for everything that is wrong at the Internal Revenue Service. But, as the saying goes, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. 
I believe this IRS reform bill is that first step, and I hope that its swift passage by the Senate will help spark the serious debate on tax policy the American people are waiting for. It is my hope--and my belief--that the Senate will begin in the very near future to respond to Americans' desire for real tax relief and real tax simplification.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute's report for the week ending May 1, that the U.S. imported 8,773,000 barrels of oil each day, an increase of 667,000 barrels over the 8,106,000 imported daily during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 57.7 percent of their needs last week. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Politicians had better give consideration to the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S: now 8,287,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it's fair to say that the so-called tobacco `debate'--and I characterize most of the rhetorical chatter as `so-called' because it (1) has amounted to little more than posturing, and (2) has created enormous uncertainty and unease for the thousands of fine Americans who earn their living in the tobacco industry. 
The public health community (and its `Amen corner' in Congress) would delight in putting the tobacco companies out of business rather than seriously and honestly addressing the issues facing the hundreds of communities in North Carolina and other states that are economically dependant on the tobacco industry. Mr. President, it's unfortunate that this issue has become so politicized that usually rational members of Congress have been totally irrational in their exaggeration of the entire situation. 
Moreover, Mr. President, it is not anywhere in recorded history that anyone ever began smoking because a gun had been leveled at his or her head with orders to smoke, or else. There is no Senator who doesn't support efforts to curtail youth smoking, and not one parent has come forward asserting that Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man have more control over their children than they do. 
But all the pious, exaggerated political nonsense aside, farmers must continue to grow their legal crop in order to provide for the livelihood of their families. 
Sometime back, I promised the farm leaders of North Carolina that I would meet with the chief executives of all tobacco companies to encourage them to buy the maximum amount of U.S. tobacco possible in 1998. I have kept that commitment. I have indeed met with the leaders of all companies, one by one. Their concern for tobacco farmers, and for all other citizens who earn their livings `in tobacco', was immediate, impressive and sincere. 
There is no doubt in my mind, as a result of these meetings, that leaders of the tobacco companies do indeed intend to purchase as much U.S. tobacco as possible this marketing season. 
In fact, some CEOs assured me that they plan to purchase more U.S. tobacco this marketing season than they purchased in 1997. One company leader emphasized his company's plans to increase its purchases of U.S. leaf every year through 2002. 
The tobacco companies understand the need to purchase at least this year's effective quota in order to prevent another substantial decrease in quota next year. There will be a lot of personal bankruptcies in North Carolina if our farmers are faced with another 10 to 17 percent reduction in quota. But I am confident--and I do expect--that the tobacco companies will honor their commitment to me and the tobacco farmers of this country to purchase U.S. tobacco this marketing season. 
Mr. President, everyone in the tobacco community--particularly the tobacco companies--realizes that the tobacco farmers should have been included in the so-called `National Tobacco Settlement' in the first place. 
Tobacco farmers and manufacturers are at a crossroads that may very well define their destiny. They can either choose to work in good faith, or they can choose not to. If they choose to harbor ill-will and mistrust, the destruction rampant in this industry will be far greater than anything Congress could ever levy by politics or legislation. 
Mr. President, during these obviously difficult times in tobacco country, squadrons of politicians in Washington and elsewhere are eager for headlines back home at the expense of the farmers. No one knows what will happen with the McCain bill, nor with any other tobacco legislation that may come forward. But I can promise you this: there will continue to be a number of special interest groups that will try to exploit the fears of the tobacco farmer for their own gain. 
I can counsel our folks back home to avoid being disillusioned. If we work together and in good faith, the tobacco farmers of America will continue to have a future, no matter the threats and pleadings from the political chorus--which is becoming a little more discordant with every passing day. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair.

 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, there is a notable chorus of Senators congratulating the people of Israel and their government on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Israel's birth. There are few things that have not been said on the subject of Israel--friend, ally, democracy. The Congress has spoken on countless occasions about Jerusalem, our commitment to Israel's security, and to peace in the Middle East. 
In the end, however, all these expressions, as heartfelt as they are, pale beside the real miracle of the Jewish people, in exile for 2000 years, having returned to the land of Israel. And on that tiny piece of land, smaller than the State of New Jersey, an incredible nation has been built--a nation that has survived five wars, untold numbers of terrorist attacks, and the hostility of most of its neighbors. 
Israel has absorbed millions of immigrants, providing homes, and jobs, and schools and freedom. Year to year, day to day, Israel may not look precisely like a land of milk and honey, but for the Jews of Europe who survived the Holocaust, and the Russians who survived Communism, it is the Promised Land. 
Israel is great, not merely because its creation is the fulfillment of a biblical promise, or because it is a faithful friend to the United States. It is great because the people of Israel are great people. I congratulate my friend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and all the people of Israel.

Mr. HELMS. Let me say that I remember the old adage is, `I like a finished speaker. I really, truly do. 
I don't mean one who's polished, I just mean one who's through.' 
I deliberately stayed away from the podium yesterday because I wanted everybody to have their say on this matter, and I think it is time for us to move along and become finished speakers. But before I do, I want to make a few comments that occurred to me when I listened in my office and on the floor--a combination of the two--to various statements that were being made. 
The Conrad amendment--and I have the greatest respect for Senator Conrad--I must unalterably oppose because the United States has never, never agreed to tactical nuclear weapons reductions with the Russians, or the Soviets, for good reason. 
First, these weapons are essential to an equitable sharing of the risk and burden associated with NATO's nuclear mission. Further, they are a visible sign that NATO is prepared to use any and all force necessary to deter an attack. Finally, there is absolutely no way that the United States can verify Russian compliance with an agreement to eliminate tactical nuclear weapons. 
Mr. President, I am increasingly fascinated by the wailing, tearing of hair, and gnashing of teeth engaged in by the more liberal of our brethren, the news media, and otherwise, regarding the impact that NATO expansion would have on the United States-Russian relationship. It seems that the only argument against NATO enlargement--aside from the `cost bugaboo'--is that Senate approval of this treaty will derail Russian ratification of START II, imperil future arms control agreements, and I have heard over and over again that it will turn Russia into a hostile power. I am going to agree to discuss these things as time goes by, but not this afternoon. 
Mr. President, there has been a surfeit of bellyaching about the START II treaty. It has been nearly 5 1/2 years since the United States and Russia signed that treaty. Since that time, Russia has used START II ratification as a pretext to hold hostage an ever-changing, ever-growing number of issues. And, of course, the weak-kneed arms controllers and Russia apologists in the United States have, in the past 5 years, been feeding the beast, encouraging the Russians to take one hostage after another. I could walk you through the various Russian threats, such as the Russians have threatened that there would be no START II treaty if the United States deploys a national missile defense. 
At a press conference before the March 1997 Helsinki summit, President Yeltsin criticized U.S. discussion of a national missile defense stating, `Well, you understand, of course, why it is that the state Duma has not yet ratified START II--because ABM was suspended.' 
Why does Russia not want the United States to abandon the ABM Treaty? Because with it we are prevented from having a national missile defense and Russia can hold our citizens hostage to its intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
Then there is a second threat. The Russians have threatened that there would be no START II unless the United States makes more foreign aid concessions. In 1996, the chairman of the Duma's defense committee, Sergei Yushkov, tied START II ratification not just merely to the ABM Treaty but to `the provision of adequate funds for the maintenance of Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal.' 
Threat No. 3: The Russians declared there would be no START II unless the United States makes other, unspecified concessions. In September of 1997, last year, there was a powerful voice that controls a sizable block of Duma votes who declared that START II should not be ratified until `a favorable moment' and that Russia should hold out for more U.S. concessions. According to this man, this leader, `We have created a powerful missile complex, and we must use it to get certain advantages.' 
Threat No. 4: The Russians declared there would be no START II if the U.S. mounts air-strikes against Saddam Hussein. In connection with the U.S. military build-up in the Persian Gulf, the Deputy Speaker of the Duma declared that START II would never be approved if the United States were to use force against Iraq. 
In the wake of that particular threat, the Russian diplomats at the United Nations have been working overtime to phase out international inspections of Saddam Hussein's chemical and biological warfare facilities. We already caught the Russians red-handed trying to sell the Iraqis a fermenter specially-designed for biological weapons, and without UNSCOM inspectors poking around, Saddam's cooperation with Russia in developing these horrible weapons will be free and unimpeded. 
Threat No. 5: The Russians declared there would be no START II unless the U.S. agrees to allow continued Russian violation of the START Treaty. Most recently, U.S. arms control negotiators were told that their refusal to shelve U.S. concerns over repeated Russian violations of the START Treaty would jeopardize START II ratification. 
I was amazed to hear some point to the recent, massive salvo of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) which the Russians launched to their destruction as the kind of cooperation that will cease if NATO is enlarged. Senators should know, as should others in the executive branch, that these SLBM launches were not emblematic of arms control cooperation. 
In fact, the Administration has noted that these SLBM launches were violations of the START Treaty because Russia refused to provide telemetry as required. They simply brushed aside our concerns and went on with their plans. 
Mr. President, the bottom line is that the Russian threat over NATO Enlargement is just one in a long, tired litany of ever-changing excuses for not ratifying START II. I urge the American people, and my fellow Senators, not to be taken in by this ludicrous argument. 
I urge those who are bemoaning the abuse that we are doing to our `Russian friends' to listen very carefully: 
There is not one arms control treaty signed by Russia that it is not violating! As I have said, Russia stands today in violation of its START Treaty obligations. 
Likewise, Russia consistently has engaged in the worst, most abhorrent perversions of bio-chemistry known to man. Russian scientists continue to work overtime at weaponizing biological pathogens in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention. According to key Russian defectors, Russia has placed enough biological agent--for example, small pox and various fever viruses--on its intercontinental ballistic missiles to wipe the human race from the face of the earth. 
Similarly, as I warned during the course of debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention, Russia is violating that treaty by clandestinely producing a series of nerve agents more lethal than any other chemical substance known to man. 
And we have all read in recent days about the robust and continuing Russian assistance to Iran's ballistic missile program, in violation of their obligations under the Missile Technology Control Regime. 
Mr. President, the list of arms control violations goes on and on. I am amazed that we are wringing our hands about antagonizing a country that is engaging in such abhorrent, reprehensible behavior. I challenge anyone to defend that regime's record of flagrant disregard for its treaty obligations, and its calculated assistance to regimes hostile to the United States. In light of these facts, piling another item onto the arms control agenda seems particularly ill-advised. 
Russia is becoming, despite our best efforts to the contrary, a rogue nation bent on challenging the United States at every turn. Neither tactical nuclear weapons nor NATO expansion have anything to do with it.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have examined the landscape, and it gets more complicated as the returns come in. Now we cannot vote until 7 o'clock, because several Senators are `far afield.' 
Then there is an agreement that was made without my knowledge--and nobody was required to get my knowledge, let alone consent--that the vote on the Bingaman amendment would not occur until the Ashcroft amendment was dealt with. So we are not going to be able to vote at 7 o'clock. 
I ask unanimous consent that sharply at 7 o'clock the vote begin on amendment No. 2320, and then we will proceed from there.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic endured nearly half a century of communist domination as a result of expedient and short-sighted policies of the West. Today, we have the opportunity to remedy that injustice while securing democracy in Central Europe for future generations. 
Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have established democratic governments, each has built a market economy, and all three work with us in defense of liberty from Cuba to China. 
In my judgment, Mr. President, these three countries belong to NATO. I have met with the Foreign Ministers of all three countries. They understand the commitment and responsibilities that they undertake by joining NATO. I am confident they will meet all of their obligations. 
The Foreign Relations Committee held 8 hearings in the past six months, heard from 37 supporters and opponents of NATO expansion. Before the Committee hearings, I myself had concerns about NATO expansion, including what it would cost, how we could deal with Russia, and the future mission of NATO. The Committee's resolution addresses all of these points and passed by a vote of 16-2. 
Mr. President, NATO enlargement has been endorsed by countless distinguished individuals including Margaret Thatcher, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Caspar Weinberger, and Richard Perle. In addition, the Foreign Relations Committee has received endorsements of this policy from every living former U.S. Secretary of State, numerous former Secretaries of Defense and national security advisors, and more than sixty flag officers and general officers, including five distinguished former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote overwhelmingly in support of NATO enlargement. This is the right decision for the United States of America.

Mr. President, rumors, they are aflying to the effect that the President of the United States has instructed the Democrats of the Senate to vote against this conference report and, if my intelligence sources are correct, it will get about three Democratic votes this afternoon. That compares with the vote of 90-5 for this very same bill, largely, that was passed by the Senate. If such game playing is going to happen, and if this conference report is defeated because of that sort of thing, then the President is going to have a difficult time about a lot of things. 
Let me say it again. The pending conference report is the result of more than a year's hard work by Senator Biden and Secretary Albright and Judd Gregg, Rod Grams, and many others to abolish two antiquated temporary Federal registries created in the 1950s and bringing reform to the United Nations. Now, if this conference report is defeated this afternoon, so be it. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, prior to the Easter recess, there was some rather spirited discussion on the question of NATO expansion, and the debate so far has shown, I believe, that most Senators are reaching the correct conclusion that bringing Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into the NATO alliance is the right thing to do. 
To be sure, there are some commentators who vow they know more than all the rest of us and who make a living on the talk shows and in newspaper op-ed pages, and they have been wringing their hands declaring how awful it is that the U.S. Senate is not taking this vital foreign policy issue seriously. How awful, they lament, it is that the Senate is not paying adequate attention to this important issue. 
Sometimes when I hear comments completely off the wall like that, I am tempted to say to these know-it-alls, `Heal thyselves.' In fact, most of them have ignored the debate that the Senate has been having for months on this issue, and most of the commentators have been following something else, maybe an intern at the White House, or whatever. If they had been paying attention, they would have known why the Senate today appears to have reached a broad consensus as to the wisdom of NATO expansion and they would not be confusing that consensus with the lack of serious discussion and debate. 
The fact is, Mr. President, we have been working with the administration leaders for 9 straight months now to fix their original approach to the NATO expansion. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate NATO observer group have made concerted efforts to address the contentious issue early on precisely to ensure that the major problems with NATO expansion were addressed by the time 12 noon today arrived and we reached the Senate floor with this proposal. 
Last fall, when we began the Foreign Relations Committee's extensive hearings on NATO expansion, I gave the administration a clear warning emphasizing that there was a right way and a wrong way to expand NATO and that, in my view, and in the view of many Senators, the administration was doing it the wrong way. 
Some may recall that when Secretary Albright first came to testify before the Foreign Relations Committee, I told that fine lady that while I wanted to be helpful to her in achieving Senate ratification of NATO expansion, it was essential that we work together to fix what was wrong with the administration's approach and make sure it was done the right way. During the ensuing months, that is precisely what we have done. 
We have held eight--count them--eight separate hearings 
in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss and debate every aspect of the administration's plan for NATO expansion. We heard from 38 different witnesses, who testified at some length each, and we produced a hearing transcript that is 552 printed pages long. 
In the Foreign Relations Committee, we had worked with Secretary Albright to make the necessary course corrections in the administration's original approach to expansion. I can report now that we have successfully made those course corrections. When we finally vote on the Senate's resolution of ratification, we will not just be voting to expand NATO, we will be voting to expand NATO the right way. 
The administration has agreed to a tightly worded resolution of ratification which includes strict, legally binding language that, among other things, requires that the core purpose of NATO must continue to be the collective defense of the territory of all NATO members, not just peacekeeping or the achievement of so-called nonmilitary goals. 
It requires that NATO defense planning command structures and force goals be centered on ensuring the territorial defense of a number of countries. 
It builds impenetrable firewalls in the NATO-Russia relationship, ensuring that Russia will have neither a voice nor a veto in NATO decisionmaking and that the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council be a forum for explaining, not negotiating, NATO policy decisions. 
It requires extensive consultation with the Senate in the case of any proposed changes in the strategic concept of NATO. 
It reaffirms that NATO does not require the consent of the United Nations or any other international organization to take any actions it deems necessary to defend the security interests of its members. 
It requires the administration to develop and to report to Congress on a plan for a NATO ballistic missile defense system to protect Europe. 
And it places strict limits on the cost to the American taxpayers for expansion, ensuring that our current NATO allies pay their fair share of the cost and that the American taxpayers will no longer be required to subsidize the national expenses of any countries, including the new members--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--for them to meet their NATO commitments. 
If the administration had refused to accept these and other conditions contained in the resolution, Mr. President, I guarantee we would not have the consensus that we have here this afternoon. I would, under that circumstance, be on the Senate floor all this week leading the fight to delay NATO expansion until the administration did accept those conditions, and the professional commentators would probably be criticizing the Senate for holding this important administration priority hostage. 
The consensus is not unanimity. A number of my Senate colleagues, for whom I have enormous respect, still have concerns. For one, we have heard some Senators raise the issue of NATO dilution. I am concerned about the dilution of NATO as well, but let's not confuse the issue. No one--no one--should be concerned that adding these new members will somehow dilute NATO. What we need to prevent is the dilution of NATO's mission and NATO's purpose, and we need to make sure that peacekeeping and nation building do not eclipse territorial defense as a primary alliance function. 
I believe we have done that with our resolution of ratification by requiring that NATO defense planning remain focused on territorial defense and tied to the security of NATO members, not vague concepts like stability in Europe. There is none of that in this resolution of ratification. 
The most important step we can take to stop NATO dilution is to bring Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into the NATO alliance, and these countries know better than anybody else the need to keep NATO focused on territorial defense. Each of these countries spent the better part of this century, remember, either under foreign occupation or as satellites of a hostile superpower. They represent three more votes within the councils of NATO for the view of NATO with a clear-cut but limited mission. 
Some have suggested that we take steps to curtail NATO's ability to act `out of area,' as they put it; that is to say, outside of the North Atlantic area. That would be a serious mistake. The threats to the NATO alliance are changing and evolving. The day may not be far off when the principal threat to the territory of NATO members would not be a resurgent Russia but a missile strike or a terrorist attack launched by rogue states such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, or Libya. 
The point is this, Mr. President: Would we really want to constrain NATO's ability to respond out of area with disproportionate force against a regime who dared to use chemical or biological weapons on the territory of a NATO member? Would we want to bar NATO's ability to strike out of area to prevent such attacks? Of course we wouldn't. With the end of the cold war, NATO's ability to act out of area will be more important as threats to the territory of NATO members change and evolve. 
Some have said that NATO expansion is unnecessarily provocative to Russia. That is just plain wrong. NATO expansion in no way threatens Russian democracy or precludes building friendly relations with Russia. If anything, it will make it easier for us to maintain friendly relations with Russia, because an expanded NATO will shut off Russia's avenue to more destructive patterns of behavior. 
Henry Kissinger pointed out that NATO expansion will `encourage Russian leaders to break with the fateful rhythm of Russian history . . . and discourage Russia's historical policy of creating a security belt of important and, if possible, politically dependent states around its borders.' 
In other words, what he was saying is Russia will no longer have the option, should the temptation ever arise, of seeking to restore its hegemony in Central Europe. With that avenue shut off, Russia is more likely to seek constructive options in its relations with the West. 
Some others have suggested that the Senate require that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic first gain admission to the European Union before we admit them to NATO. With all due respect to our friends in Europe, the European Union could not find its way out of a wet paper bag, and we need to face up to that. 
Giving the European Union a veto over who does and who does not get into NATO would be nothing less than the abdication of American leadership in Europe. The fact is this: Admitting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to NATO is in America's best interest. If it were not, I would not be standing here this afternoon. These nations will be among the most reliable pro-American NATO allies that we could ever hope for. 
Indeed, I would go so far as to say that not only do these countries need NATO, America needs these countries in NATO. 
That was certainly clear to me during the standoff with Iraq earlier this year. While many of our current NATO allies stuck their heads in the sand and wiggled their fannies, Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic did not do that. They immediately and without hesitation said, `We will send troops in alongside the American forces if a military response is necessary in Iraq.' 
Furthermore, while many of our friends in Europe pursue policies in Cuba and China--that is, self-serving policies--these countries stand with us in working to promote human rights and to promote democracy in those last few bastions of communism. 
So, Mr. President, I am convinced that Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic will be among the first to stand with us in times of crisis and will support America as we work to ensure that NATO remains what it is today--the most effective military alliance in human history. 
As I have tried to make clear, through the efforts of many Senators we have ensured with this pending resolution of ratification that NATO expansion is done the right way. I urge all Senators to vote for this resolution and right the historical wrongs of Yalta and support NATO expansion. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, my response to my friend from Virginia has to be in many parts. I just told my helpmate here that we did a drivel here and a drivel there, all formal and official estimates. Before we go any further, I want to get the Senator's question on paper, and then we will give the citations for the various figures. The problem is that the cost of operating NATO, oddly enough, reduces in the early years, and then it will go up, and then it will come down again. I want to explain that so that the Senator will understand it and, to be honest, so that I will understand it a little better myself. It is things like that. Why don't we get together and get the specific question about the specific figures, and we will give the Senator the responses on which we based our judgment.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute's report for the week ending April 17, that the U.S. imported 9,503,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,519,000 more barrels than the 6,424,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relief on foreign oil for 59.6 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S: now 9,503,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. I thank the distinguished occupant of the chair, who is a valued member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I say good morning to him, and all the others who are here this morning. 
Mr. President, back in the middle of the 20th century--and when I say that I sound like I'm talking about a long time ago--Congress created a number of temporary, independent federal agencies. I think it was a bad mistake. If I had been here, I would not have voted to do that, having the hindsight that I have. But, of course, members of Congress did not have the hindsight. They had just gone through, not too many years earlier, a horrible World War and were trying to get this Government stabilized, trying to help get the rest of the world stabilized. This seemed like a good idea, to create these specialized, independent Federal agencies. 
Ronald Reagan, when he was President, had to deal with what these independent agencies had become--and they did grow mighty independent. He would say, `There is nothing so near eternal life as a temporary Federal agency.' 
I read the other day that the responsibilities of just one of these agencies is duplicated by about 42 other entities in the Federal Government. And of course the cost of running the U.S. bureaucracy has risen constantly. Furthermore, there is what has become an interesting psychology among those who not only run these agencies but are employed by them. The agencies have become the personal little fiefdoms of these bureaucrats, and they fight tenaciously at any attempt to do away with their turf or, as this conference report proposes to do, to mesh these agencies with the rest of the State Department foreign policy apparatus. In order to pass this legislation, we have gone through a great deal of difficulty, but turf protection is only one of the difficulties. Let me proceed, if I may, to give some further historical reference, with an assessment of the situation that now exists. 
Of course, we have before us as the pending official business the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, which I believe, it is fair to say, is the most comprehensive and far-reaching foreign policy reform ever considered by the Congress of the United States regarding both the United Nations and the executive branch of this country. Now then, the distinguished Senator from Delaware and I, and many others, have spent not months but years working on this proposition. We made every proper and reasonable concession in arriving at the general draft of this legislation that is now before us in the form of a conference report issued by the House and the Senate. 
So it has been the result of long and painstaking negotiations between the Congress and the administration. The sweeping and bipartisan reforms contained in this conference report are clearly 
designed to enhance America's post-cold war foreign-policy-making process and to force some fundamental reforms on the United Nations. 
With the full support of the administration, this legislation shuts down two Federal agencies--the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the U.S. Information Agency. I say `now.' That is a relative term, in terms of doing something in the Federal Government. It has to be done within the next 18 months. 
The legislation also requires the Secretary of State to rein in the existing increasingly unwieldy U.S. foreign aid agency, the Agency for International Development, and it strengthens the independence of U.S. public diplomacy and international broadcasting programs. 
The legislation also mandates a series of deep-seated reforms at the United Nations, which many Members of this Senate and of the House of Representatives have been demanding for years. I remember the distinguished Senator from Kansas, a gentlelady if there ever was one, Nancy Kassebaum, whose ire was raised when she found out what was going on in terms of irresponsibility in the operation of the United Nations. 
How to get it under control? I am going to discuss that in some detail in just a minute. All you hear these days is talk about how wonderful the United Nations is--and that is not so, it is a bureaucratic nightmare--and how bad the United States and the American people are for not paying what is called `the arrearages.' Hogwash. For more than a year, I have worked with Senator Biden, Senator Grams, Senator Gregg, and others, to create a package of reform benchmarks--reforms that the State Department must certify that the United Nations has completed--before they are paid any of these so-called arrearages. In other words, it is a very clear put up or shut up. 
For months, we negotiated these reforms with the State Department and the White House. In fact, we even shared our proposals with Kofi Annan, the distinguished Secretary-General of the United Nations, so that the international elite in New York and Geneva would not be blindsided by these requirements for reform of the United Nations. 
Kofi Annan came down and visited me one day. We had a nice visit. We went to several places on Capitol Hill together. One by one--in S. 116, down on the first floor of this Capitol, which is one of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing rooms--we went down the list, benchmark by benchmark by benchmark by benchmark, and he nodded, and he nodded, and he nodded. 
This conference report contains the fruits of hundreds of hours of bipartisan negotiations. Maybe it could be done better, but I don't know anybody in this Senate who is going to take the time to do it better, because it is going to take hundreds upon hundreds more hours to change the kinds of things that we worked out. 
You are going to have the lobbyists from the United Nations piling all over Senators, `Oh, you can't do this, we've got to have our money right now.' You are going to have lobbyists for this agency and this independent agency and all the rest. They don't want to be folded into the foreign policy apparatus that exists and which costs billions upon billions of dollars of the taxpayers' money. 
It is either now or never. The game playing is over, and the enactment of this legislation represented by this conference report between the House and the Senate is the last shot the President will have at enacting this legislation. If members want to go home and tell their constituents, `Well, I didn't like this aspect,' or `I didn't like that aspect,' I am going to be right behind you saying, `Yes, but `what he didn't do' or `what she didn't do' is vote to clean up a mess in Washington, DC.' 
This conference report, as I say, contains the fruits of hundreds upon hundreds of hours of labor. Once these U.N. reform benchmarks are implemented, only then will be made $819 million available for the United Nations and other international organizations. In addition, the President will be authorized to forgive an additional $107 million in debt that the United Nations owes the United States. Nobody ever mentions that. Of course, it is a lot bigger than that when you figure in the American people have paid for all of these police actions that the United Nations has been doing all around the world. But that is neither here nor there for the time being. 
What I am saying, Mr. President, is that there has been no disagreement about any of these provisions. So the substance of this bill, a complete overhaul of our Government's foreign policy apparatus, and the reform of the United Nations, which has to come before a dollar changes hands, remains virtually unchanged since the Senate passed this bill, by a vote of 90 to 5, on June 17, 1997. 
Let me restate for the obvious an important point. This conference report remains virtually unchanged from the bill passed by the Senate by a vote of 90 to 5 last year. The Senate has overwhelmingly endorsed the reforms, and the Clinton administration has signed off on them. Let's see who reneges on this agreement. Will it be the administration? Will the administration veto this bill because of two or three lines that it happens not to like? We will find out, won't we? 
All those Senators who say, `Well, I don't like this aspect of it, so I'm not going to vote for any of it,' had better be prepared to explain what they, in effect, voted against. If they want to come and sit down and talk with Joe Biden and me, we will explain the purpose and the reason for everything in this bill. 
And yet--and this is bothersome to me, I confess--we are now facing a razor-thin majority vote in the Senate. We might not even have a majority. Far from lobbying the Senate for passage of this legislation, the President has been standing over there in the wings and has indicated that he may veto the bill, the substance of which his administration had negotiated with us and agreed to with us. 
Why is the President threatening to veto this bill? One small provision--a few words included by our House colleagues--section 1816 bars American organizations from using U.S. taxpayers' dollars to lobby foreign governments to change their abortion laws. I guarantee you, that is all there is to it, and the President sits down on Pennsylvania Avenue and says, `If you don't take that out, I'm going to veto it; I don't care whether you save billions of dollars or not.' 
Mr. President, as they do in grade school, this is show-and-tell day--put-up-or-shut-up. 
I tell you one thing, I have tried to get along with the administration, but if the administration vetoes this bill because of those few lines, I am going to go do everything I can, go everywhere I can and explain exactly what the President did. I have dealt with him on this thing and he has been very 
accommodating, and so have his people, but if he wants trouble on this bill, just veto it, and I will give him some trouble. 
That little provision for which he is threatening to veto this bill--let me repeat--it stops those who advocate abortion--that is the deliberate destruction of innocent and helpless human life--from using tax dollars paid by the American people to lobby foreign governments to change their policies on abortion. 
I did not want to have the subject mentioned. I could have put it in this bill when it went through the Senate, but I thought we ought to address the real problem in this bill, and that is this foreign policy apparatus which has become so bloated and with so many other Federal entities running around duplicating each other's business. 
I do not believe in my heart of hearts, or cannot believe, that Mr. Clinton and his Democratic allies in the Senate would be willing to sacrifice the payment of U.N. arrears--one of their top foreign policy priorities--just to preserve the ability of nongovernmental organizations to use American tax money to lobby foreign governments on the question of abortion. I refuse to believe that the President is going to `pick up his pen,' as Ronald Reagan used to say, and veto it. If he does, some of us are going to react. 
But that is exactly what a lot of people are proposing in the Senate: `Oh, I can't vote for it because of that abortion language.' They don't care anything about all the millions of dollars this legislation is going to save, or about the elimination of the duplication of bureaucracy. Instead, two or three little lines involving, what I regard anyhow, an abuse of American taxpayers' money, are the grounds for voting against this bill. 
Some on the other side have been heard going around calling section 1816 the `Mexico City' policy. It `ain't' the Mexico City policy, not a bit of it. I helped write the Mexico City policy way back when Ronald Reagan, by Executive order, made it part of this country's position. But don't take my word for it. I want every Senator to read the bill or the conference report, especially section 1816. And to help them look for it and find it, section 1816 is on page 102 of this conference report. If you can't find page 102 of the conference report, come right here, and I will find it and put it in your little hot hands. But let's not play games about it. Put up or shut up, show and tell. 
What did Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy do? 
It forbade any expenditure of U.S. taxpayer money going to any organizations that performed abortions abroad. 
Ronald Reagan was a strong and sincere, genuine pro-life President. You do not see many of them coming along. The provision in this conference report does not do what the Mexico City policy did. 
As much as I wish it were otherwise, section 1816 will not cut off funding to organizations that perform abortions as required under President Reagan's original Mexico City policy. All section 1816 does is simply prohibit population control groups from using American taxpayers' money,--which they will receive under current law anyhow--to lobby foreign countries to overturn their laws pertaining to abortion. That is it, sum total. If anybody in the press or the media doubt it, come on down here; we will talk about it. No, they are not even here. There is one lonely soul sitting up there in the media gallery. 
Initially, last year, the House did include or try to include President Reagan's full Mexico City language in this bill. When the House did that, the Clinton administration said, `No. The President will veto this bill.' And there ensued a months-long standoff which lasted until the waning hours of the last session of Congress. 
Now, then, Mr. President, despite my personal support--my personal support--for the Mexico City policy, I urged my House colleagues to remove that provision from the bill. I said, `We can fight that battle on another battleground. Let's not kill this one opportunity we are going to have to revamp and consolidate and shape up the foreign policy apparatus of this country.' I did this because I knew that the President would never accept a full reversal of his administration's stand on the Mexico City policy which was totally at odds with those of the stand of Ronald Reagan. 
Last November, in an effort to reach a compromise, the House of Representatives' leaders watered down the abortion language in the bill to the point that I have stated over and over this morning--simply to ban the use of U.S. dollars to lobby foreign governments to change their abortion laws. But despite an exceedingly reasonable offer from the House, this was still not good enough for the administration. The administration rejected this compromise as the session came to an end last year, citing nonbinding report language that they claim would have barred the U.S. groups from even attending international conferences aimed at changing abortion laws. This they said would amount--get this, Mr. President--this would amount to a `gag rule.' 
Come this spring, House leaders offered a second compromise. They agreed to remove the offending report language, softening it simply to prevent the use of U.S. tax dollars to sponsor such conferences. So it is all right to attend them, but do not use tax money to sponsor them. In fact, I have to say this about the House leadership. They have been so reasonable in their efforts to reach a compromise that today the abortion language before us in this legislation is so limited that its approval would be little more than a symbolic concession on the part of the Clinton administration. 
But even that appears to be too much from what I hear because the lobbyists say all Democrats must vote against this bill. That is the word I am hearing floating around. And we will see when the roll is called on it. We will see. 
At this point it is unreasonable, I think, to suggest that it is the House leaders who have been exhibiting intransigence. While the House has offered compromise after compromise, giving up 90 percent of their ground, the administration still, to this day, is demanding total and complete capitulation. What they are saying is: `Kill the conference report. Forget it. Don't do away with any of these irrelevant, unnecessary Federal agencies and the bureaucracies. Let's keep on keeping on.' They do not seem to care what the costs are. I have not heard that mentioned one time--not one time--by the administration. 
Mr. President, I am not going to take any more of the Senate's 
time discussing this issue, because I do not view it as central to the reforms contained in the conference report. I want to get back to that before I turn over the podium to my good, fine friend, Senator Biden. 
Mr. President, not anybody--not the administration, not the Democrats, certainly not Jesse Helms--got everything any of us wanted in this conference report. I acknowledge that. But we did work together in a remarkably novel way to cooperate, and to craft the legislation that is before the Senate today that forms the conference report. This legislation, save for one single provision on international abortion lobbying, is the result of strong bipartisan consensus. And that is a novelty around this place. And that is the reason it passed the Senate the first time around 90-5. 
I think, Mr. President, it will be a terrible mistake for the Senate Democrats and the White House to kill these absolutely imperative, essential, necessary reforms in order to defend the bureaucratic status quo at the United Nations, not to mention within our own executive branch, to defend the bloated foreign policy apparatus. 
So let me be candid. This legislation represents quite possibly the last chance to bring true, deep-seated change to the United Nations in return for U.S. arrearages payments. If Democrats succeed in voting down this conference report or if the President chooses to veto this legislation, then they together will decide what is going to happen in the future; they will bear sole responsibility, I think, for the unpaid dues to the United Nations. And nobody is going to tell Kofi Annan, if this conference report goes down in the Senate or if it is vetoed by the President, `The check's in the mail,' because it is never going to be in the mail, certainly not if I have anything to do with it. 
This Senator, for one, will delay crying, weeping, when the White House complains that funding has not been made available to the United Nations. Next time I see the President I am going to say, `Mr. President, you did it. You did it.' 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. Thank you very much.  
Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, do not be misled by the modesty of the distinguished Senator from Delaware. He knows as much about tactics as anybody I have ever seen. It is true that we came here the same day. I think we have learned at the feet of certain masters that we have known. Some have gone--departed. But, anyway, it has been great working with the Senator. I appreciate his kind comments, and we will have to see how it comes out. 
Mr. President, how much time remains? I believe we had, at the outset, a total of 6 hours allocated. Is that correct?

 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the resolution that I am offering today, along with 28 other Senators, is intended to commemorate the 90th Anniversary of the United States Army Reserve and to honor the soldiers who have served in the USAR, including our good friend and Senate President pro tempore, Senator Strom Thurmond, who served with distinction as an Army Reservist for 36 years. 
Winston Churchill once remarked that `the reservist is twice the citizen.' Indeed, the accolade `twice the citizen' serves as the title of the definitive history of the U.S. Army Reserve that was written by the late Colonel Richard B. Crossland and Colonel James T. Currie, whose assistance was invaluable in drafting this resolution. The concept that reservists fulfill multiple roles as citizens in their community while simultaneously training for war and other military operations was never more true than today. 
Today's Army Reserve of almost 487,000 Ready Reserve and Standby Reserve soldiers and 600,000 Retired Reserve soldiers is a far cry from its predecessor, the Medical Reserve Corps, which was authorized by statute on April 23, 1908. On that date, President Theodore Roosevelt signed an act `to Increase the Efficiency of the Medical Department of the United States Army.' The act provided for the commissioning of a few hundred Reserve medical doctors, in order to avert future shortages of officers, such as the one that had occurred during the Spanish-American War. 
Mr. President, since that modest beginning, the USAR has grown to become a community-based force with over 1200 facilities across the United States and more than 2000 units in the United States and its territories. 
While comprising only about 20 percent of the Army's organized units and receiving only about 5 percent of the Army's budget , today's Army Reserve includes 46 percent of the Army's combat service support (CSS) assets and more than a quarter of the Army's combat support (CS) assets. These assets include medical, engineer, transportation, civil affairs, legal, military police, and psychological operations units which are essential to any military operation. 
From World War I when the USAR contributed more than 160,000 soldiers to the United States Army, through World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Desert Shield/Desert Storm, the soldiers of the USAR have been ready when the President called upon them. 
Even today, as we spend more and more of our limited defense resources on so-called `contingency operations' and `operations other than war,' the soldiers of the USAR and their families are making the sacrifices necessary to serve their country. 
Each year, the Army Reserve deploys approximately 20,000 soldiers to 50 countries worldwide on a variety of missions. In Bosnia alone, the Army Reserve has contributed almost 15,000 citizen-soldiers, representing more than 70% of the Army's reserve component mobilization. 
Mr. President, I recently received a letter from Colonel Herbert N. Harmon (USMCR), National President of the Reserve Officers Association, who suggested that I introduce this resolution. 
I am honored to do so. 
Mr. President, it is appropriate that Senator Thurmond and the citizen-soldiers of the USAR be honored on the occasion of the Army Reserves 90th Anniversary on April 23, 1998. For, in many ways, Senator Thurmond's service as a reservist is the story of the consummate citizen-soldier. 
His remarkable record of service as a reservist began in 1924 when he received a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Infantry. By the time he transferred to the Retired Reserve in 1965, Senator Thurmond had risen to the rank of Major General, the highest rank available to a Reserve Officer. 
Then First Lieutenant Thurmond volunteered the day war was declared against Germany even though his position as a South Carolina Circuit Judge exempted him from service in World War II. He received a commission in the active Army, became a member of the First U.S. Army and was attached to the 82nd Airborne Division for the Normandy invasion. It was during that action that he sustained an injury for which he was awarded a Purple Heart. 
While serving in Europe, Senator Thurmond served in all battles of the First Army, which fought through France, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. In addition to the Purple Heart, he received numerous other awards and commendations for his heroism and valor, including the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal with V device and the Army Commendation Ribbon just to cite a few. 
Mr. President, it would be difficult to overstate Senator Thurmond's contribution to the security of our country and our gratitude for his exceptional service. Suffice it to say that he is, perhaps, the single most qualified person ever to serve as the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and that I am honored to have had the privilege of serving with him for these past 25 years. 
I am also grateful for the service and the sacrifices of the soldiers who willingly serve in, and the families who support, the Army Reserve. Their dedication, commitment, and accomplishments are properly noted on this occasion. 
Mr. President, I urge Senators to support this resolution and to join me in honoring Senator Thurmond and the soldiers of the United States Army Reserve. It's the right thing to do and I am confident that Senators will agree.

Mr. HELMS. Madam President, last week we passed Tax Day 1998. All across the nation, the IRS reported millions of taxpayers suffered confusion and animosity over filing their 1997 taxes. While no confusion exists--in fact, the financial amount is too clear--every man, woman and child should feel animosity at the more than $20,000 bill issued them to pay off the federal debt. 
In the same vein, Mr. President, May 10th will be Tax Freedom Day 1998. While the name speaks for itself, Tax Freedom Day was not always such a landmark day because the federal debt was neither so monstrous nor so cumbersome. Tax Freedom Day comes one day later than last year. 
It is fortunate that so many reminders that the federal debt will continue to escalate unless and until Congress restrains its desire to spend, spend, spend. Hopefully one day Congress will wake up. 
Madam President, with this in mind, let's begin where we left off: 
At the close of business Friday, April 17, 1998, the federal debt stood at $5,512,826,076,386.32 (Five trillion, five hundred twelve billion, eight hundred twenty-six million, seventy-six thousand, three hundred eighty-six dollars and thirty-two cents). 
One year ago, April 17, 1997, the federal debt stood at $5,350,647,000,000 (Five trillion, three hundred fifty billion, six hundred forty-seven million). 
Twenty-five years ago, April 17, 1973, the federal debt stood at $455,209,000,000 (Four hundred fifty-five billion, two hundred nine million) which reflects a debt increase of more than $5 trillion--$5,057,617,076,386.32 (Five trillion, fifty-seven billion, six hundred seventeen million, seventy-six thousand, three hundred eighty-six dollars and thirty-two cents) during the past 25 years.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I was regrettably late in learning about the inevitable death of former U.S. Senator Terry Sanford this past Saturday, April 18. I say inevitable because it was. All of us, especially Terry himself, knew what was coming when last December the fatal inoperable cancer was discovered. 
Terry faced up to the reality of it all with his typical courage. He told reporters at the time that he would continue to be active as long as he could, and take every day as it came. Then he plunged into a whirlwind fund-raising schedule on behalf of a project near and dear to his heart. 
It was impossible not to like and admire Terry Sanford. He was never one of my supporters, nor was I ever one of his. But we were friends and there was never a hint of discord during his six years in the Senate--or before, for that matter, or since. 
As Senators who were here during Senator Sanford's six years will testify, Terry was a respected colleague. For my part, I always had the feeling that he had been vastly more comfortable being Governor. He could push a button then and things happened. Not so with the Senate. We sort of canceled each other's vote in the Senate much of the time he was here but there never was an instance when we didn't work together for the betterment of North Carolina. And there was never the slightest hostility. 
In short, Mr. President, I liked Terry Sanford. He has undeniably left his mark upon the destiny of the state he loved--and certainly upon Duke University which was the multi-million dollar beneficiary of his skillful fund-raising ability. 
He lived life to the fullest; he was a man who loved his family and his country. If he ever wasted a moment, I am not aware of it.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am confident that all Senators--indeed millions of Americans--are deeply grateful to the able Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, for his remarkable leadership on the drug issue. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee with jurisdiction over international narcotics affairs, Senator Coverdell has developed an expertise here at home and overseas. He is a credit to both the Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate. 
The joint resolution that Senator Coverdell and I have brought before the Senate today concerns a very complex issue. But, it can be boiled down in terms of its significance to 6 words: `The President should tell the truth.' 
The subject before us is Mexico--specifically, the President's unwise and unjustified decision to certify to the U.S. Congress that the Government of Mexico is `cooperating fully' with America's anti-drug efforts. That is precisely what Mr. Clinton told us on February 26. 
Since then, we have heard the rest of the story. Regarding the role Mexico plays in the drug trade, the President's own State Department tells us that `Mexico is a major transit point for U.S.-bound cocaine shipments from South America,' and `(Mexico) is a major producer of marijuana and a significant producer of heroin, most of which is destined for the U.S.,' and `Criminal organizations based in Mexico are now the most significant wholesale and retail distributors of methamphetamine.' 
These facts warn us that the United States simply cannot let the Mexican government off the hook when it comes to fighting drugs. 
When the President certified Mexico's full cooperation, he told us, `The U.S. is convinced of the Zedillo Administration's firm intention to persist in its campaign against the drug cartels.' 
A few weeks later, the story changed. Mary Lee Warren, a senior Justice Department official, told a House Committee on March 18, `None of the senior members of the (Tijuana Cartel) has been arrested.' 
She also noted that charges dating from 1992 against the head of the Sonora Cartel `were dismissed.' 
And, she said that `Mexico had not charged or apprehended any principal' of Mexico's third cartel (the Amezcua organization). 
Senators surely will ask themselves, why does the President tell us that Mexico will `persist in its campaign against the drug cartels' when his own Justice Department and his own DEA tell us that Mexico is not waging such a campaign? 
In certifying Mexico, the President told us, `Drug seizures in 1997 generally increased over 1996 levels.' 
Not true. The State Department's statistics tell a different story. Mexico's 1997 seizures of heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine are at, or well below, 1996 levels. 
Although cocaine seizures are up from last year, they total well below the 50 metric tons of cocaine seized in 1991. And, despite the growing role of Mexican traffickers in the methamphetamine market, Mexico's seizure of that product has dropped significantly to one-fifth of 1996 levels and one-tenth of 1995 levels. 
Another troubling subject is extradition. Most of us believe that Mexico will become a safe-haven for drug kingpins as long as that government refuses to turn over Mexican drug lords to face justice in American courts. 
All told, there are about 120 requests for `provisional arrest' and `extradition' pending in Mexico. 
But, not one Mexican national was extradited and surrendered to U.S. custody on drug charges throughout 1997 and so far this year. In fact, no Mexican has been surrendered to U.S. custody on any crime since April 1996. The State Department reports that all 5 Mexican nationals approved for extradition on drug charges have appealed their extradition orders. 
There is, obviously, a pattern here. A Mexican wanted for child molestation can be surrendered to U.S. justice. A foreigner wanted for drug crimes may be handed over, as well. But a Mexican drug trafficker is made to feel very much at home in Mexico. 
Another problem is corruption. Mr. President, we must not forget the February 1997 scandal when Mexico's drug czar was found to be on the payroll of one of Mexico's most blood-thirsty cartels. 
The Administration has cited repeatedly Mexico's handling of this scandal as evidence of Mexico's commitment to ferreting out corruption. Indeed, a senior Justice Department official told Congress just law week, `The [corrupt drug czar's] arrest is a noteworthy testimony to President Zedillo's anti-corruption commitment.' 
In light of these rosey commendations, we were surprised by a report in today's New York Times that U.S. law enforcement officials have concluded privately that this scandal and the way the Mexican government handled it may be just the tip of the iceberg of drug corruption in Mexico's military. 
One unnamed U.S. official told the New York Times that this news of deeper corruption `point to much of our work in Mexico being an exercise in futility.' 
According to this published report, U.S. officials discussed these findings with Attorney General Janet Reno more than 2 weeks before the President's certification of Mexico. 
The fact that this assessment comes to Congress' attention through the media and not in the President's `certifications' to the Congress suggests an appalling lack of candor on the part of the Administration. The Committee on Foreign Relations intends to investigate this revelation. 
More recent examples of alleged corruption border on being countless. 
Mexico's attorney general admitted last September that he had to turn to the military for law enforcement because, in his words, he `couldn't find civilians who could demonstrate the honesty and efficiency for the work.' 
But military men--as well as civilian police--have themselves been accused of stealing cocaine that had been seized by the government. Also, last year, the federal police commander in charge of intelligence for the border task forces--which are supposed to cooperate closely with our DEA--was accused of taking bribes and trafficking in drugs in Arizona. 
Such flagrant examples of corruption remind us that meaningful anti-drug cooperation will never be possible without honest, competent people with the skills and resources to do their job. 
Beginning 12 months ago, Mexico's anti-drug forces were dismantled entirely. It takes time to put these units back in place--which is what we have been helping the Mexicans do for most of last year. 
Today, fewer than one-third of the 3,000 employees of the special anti-drug prosecutor's office are on duty. About one-third of the 300 staff members of the organized crime unit are in place. And only two-thirds of the small border task forces staff have been cleared for duty. 
It is fair to point out that these new anti-drug units also lack the experience and the resources to do their jobs. 
It is fair to ask whether Mexico has the ability to `cooperate fully' to fight drugs--even if it had the political will to do so, which it obviously does not. 
Finally, Mr. President, let's turn to an issue that speaks eloquently to the Mexican government's lack of political will to work with us. Despite numerous threats and several attacks on U.S. and Mexican police, President Zedillo has insisted that our DEA agents cannot carry weapons for their self-defense while in Mexico. The Mexicans argue that this is a question of `sovereignty.' 
Baloney. I have two questions for the officials in Mexico City: Where were these questions of sovereignty in the 1970s and 1980s, when the Mexican government allowed Marxist Central American guerrillas to operate freely in Mexican territory? 
And, why does that government fear having a couple of dozen American DEA and FBI agents carrying weapons for their own protection? 
Mr. President, I hope Senators will consider the facts so clearly evident. Under the law, the President of the United States has the duty to certify a country's full cooperation when there has been `full cooperation.' The sad truth is that there has been no `full cooperation.' 
Therefore, Senate Joint Resolution 42 deserves the support of all Senators who truly want to bring drug trafficking under control. This will send a message to the Mexican government that it can no longer be A.W.O.L. in the war on drugs.

<DOCNO>105-helms-nc-2-19980325</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
As I was saying, I, first, want to offer my personal assessment of some of the red hot rhetoric coming from and by critics of the United Nations, and even from this 
administration, regarding the decision by the Congress to withhold a portion of the funding for the United Nations until genuine reforms are implemented by the United Nations. I happen to know quite a bit about this as a result of my having spent months and hundreds of hours in painstaking negotiations with Members of both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate and the administration in coming up with a legislative package to pay the so-called `U.S. arrearages' to the United Nations in exchange for meaningful reform of the United Nations. 
That package of reforms passed the Senate twice--once by a vote of 90 to 5. And the conference report has been filed with the House and Senate. But, unfortunately, by an astounding display of administration priorities, the White House chose to block this reform bill at the end of the first session of this Congress after the House of Representatives added one single provision protecting unborn babies from deliberate mass destruction. 
Amidst all of that, our able and distinguished Secretary of State was reported as having claimed that not paying the United Nations would result in what she called a `shutdown of our national security policy.' That statement, by a lady whom I admire and respect, surprised and saddened me, Mr. President, because Madeleine Albright is bound to know better than almost anybody else that U.S. national security policy is run out of the White House, along with the State Department, which Madeleine Albright, of course, heads. And also it is run by the Defense Department. 
But, Mr. President, Congress has a critical role in all of this as well--`this' being a tripartite system of government that we have in our country. The security policies of the United States are not run by the United Nations, nor by the U.N. Security Council, nor by Kofi Annan. Thus, holding out a portion of U.S. funds for the United Nations in exchange for long overdue significant reforms designed to strengthen the U.S. national security certainly will not result in a `shutdown of our national security policy.' 
It is not surprising, however, to hear the familiar anti-American drumbeat out of the United Nations and from some of its members. I find it interesting that some diplomats at the United Nations undiplomatically tossed around the name `deadbeat,' referring to the United States. In fact, the U.N. Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, implied as much in his March 9 New York Times op-ed piece entitled, `The Unpaid Bill That's Crippling the U.N.' 
I have a chart here showing that article by the Secretary General, and I hope the people operating the cameras will make that clear. 
I like Kofi Annan fine. He has visited me a number of times--one time recently in my office in the last 10 days. But in this piece, the Secretary General made the absurd declaration, a non sequitur, if I ever heard one. And I quote him: `Fiji has done its part. What about the U.S.?" 
Well, Mr. President, the Secretary General is a man, I must reiterate, whom I have regarded and have often described as an honorable man. I brought up his statement when he visited me in my office 2 weeks ago. 
And, by the way, Mr. President, just for the record, Fiji's United Nations' assessment for 1998 was precisely $47,636. The assessment for the United States, our country, on the other hand, was billed for $297,727,256. But that is not the all of 
it. The U.S. taxpayers will pay a total of $901 million to the United Nations and its affiliated agencies and other international organizations in fiscal year 1998. And that does not include another $210 million that American taxpayers are being demanded to pay for U.S. peacekeeping. And that all adds up to $1.110 billion. 
So, it goes without saying that our friend, the U.N. Secretary General--I suppose in trying to be a little bit cute --in fact ended up both absurd and untruthful. And I do hope that it was his staff, not the Secretary General himself, that came up with that quip. Because, as I say, I have always regarded Kofi Annan as a sensible man. 
Nevertheless, it is a perfect example of the disingenuous, even dishonest arguments being floated to misrepresent the United States of America, designed to make us pay even more than what we are willing to or obliged to pay in support of the United Nations. Clearly, it is time for Congress to meet head on such outrageous charges from those who do not represent American taxpayers. That is what my amendment is intended to do.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, instead of complaining that the United States is not handing over even more millions and millions of dollars, the United Nations and its members should be thanking the American taxpayers for their generosity for the past 50 years and the support of the United States, which continues to provide it. I doubt that anybody will seriously argue that the United Nations would even exist today had it not been for the United States and for the generous support provided by the American taxpayers through good times and bad times. So the pending amendment stresses this obvious truth and suggests that the United Nations tone down its crybaby rhetoric and acknowledge the plain truth. The amendment also calls upon the United Nations to adjust its peacekeeping assessments to reflect the 25 percent U.S. support for peacekeeping costs that the Congress and the administration have agreed to pay. 
The amendment further asks that the administration introduce a resolution in the U.N. Security Council to require the United Nations to report the total amount of money the United States has paid in supporting and/or implementing Security Council resolutions since 1990 and for the Secretary of State to inform all United Nations members of this report. 
Finally, the amendment requires the President of the United States to detail all actions taken by the United States to carry out the aforementioned recommendations. 
Mr. President, let me offer several examples of why the pending amendment is essential. First, a scandalous situation in which the United States is treated unfairly involves the assessment for regular operations of the United Nations. This past December, the United Nations General Assembly voted to reduce the minimum assessment a country must pay to be a member of the United Nations. They reduced it from one-hundredth of 1 percent, that's 0.01, to one-thousandth of 1 percent, 0.001, and the Clinton administration went along with this giveaway. Of course the U.S. assessment was not reduced 1 cent, not a farthing, not a penny. 
Under this new formula, 29 countries now pay just one-thousandth of 1 percent, .001 of the regular U.N. budget, amounting to $10,516 a year for each of the 29 countries for the year 1998. Mr. President, 41 other countries pay between two-thousandths of 1 percent, that is .002, and .009, nine-thousandths of 1 percent. That is between $21,032 and $94,647 of the regular U.N. budget for 1998. Four countries pay one-hundredth of 1 percent, that is .01 of the budget, U.N. budget, for an assessment of $105,163 each. Another 84 countries, like Red China, for example, which regularly undermines U.S. interests in the Security Council, will pay less than 1 percent--less than 1 percent--of the U.N. budget. But the American taxpayers, they will foot the bill for 25 percent of the U.N. regular budget, and that is $297,727,256, or 28,312 times more than what 29 countries pay, and it is far more than what all the rest pay. 
Mr. President, 7 years ago I asked my lifelong friend, Adm. Bud Nance, with whom I grew up in Monroe, NC, to assume the responsibilities of chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee. Bud Nance had completed a distinguished 38-year career in the Navy. Among other things, he was skipper of the U.S.S. Forrestal, an aircraft carrier that had more sailors aboard than we had people in our hometown. He later served as President Reagan's Deputy National Security Adviser. But the point is, Bud Nance, my friend, agreed to serve his country and 
his friend--that is the way he put it--on one condition. He would come and work as chief of staff if he received no pay. He did not want to be paid a cent because, he said, his country had paid him well while he was in the Navy and now he wanted to return something to his country. So he came. 
The admiral and I learned, after he came, that no staff person in the Senate can hold a security clearance, which is essential for holding a job, unless he or she is paid at least a minimum salary, just over $1,000 a year. Several years later Congress applied the laws it forces the rest of America to live under to itself. It was made applicable to Bud Nance, and we had to give Bud a pay raise. It was forced upon him, and he was therefore paid the minimum wage for being chief of staff with one of the Senate's most important committees; that is to say, Bud Nance earns $10,712 a year. That is all he earns. He does not want to accept that. 
In any case, when Bud Nance told me that the United Nations reduced the assessment of 29 countries to just $10,560 apiece annually, he reminded me that the minimum annual wage in this country, the $10,712 the Senate pays him, is more than these sovereign countries pay in annual dues to the United Nations. 
Mr. President, how about another example? Compare Russia's 2.8 percent U.N. assessment, compare it with the United States 25 percent assessment. And Egypt? Egypt is one of the largest recipients of U.S. foreign aid, and it will receive $2.1 billion in foreign aid from the American taxpayers this year. Yet Egypt will pay just 69-hundredths of 1 percent of the regular U.N. budget, far less than $1 million. By the way, Egypt voted against the United States 61 percent of the time in the United Nations in 1997. 
India, which will receive approximately $143 million in foreign aid from the United States, that is to say the American taxpayers--India will pay just three-tenths of 1 percent of the regular U.N. budget. India voted against the United States 76 percent of the time in 1997. 
So it is obvious that the United States pays far more than its fair share. And what about the U.S. support for peacekeeping operations? The amount that I mentioned earlier for this, $210 million, really is only a fraction of the amount the United States will pay for U.N. peacekeeping in fiscal year 1998. As a part of the 1997 appropriations for the Armed Forces, Congress required the Pentagon to report on the costs incurred by the U.S. military in implementing or supporting U.N. Security Council resolutions. Heretofore, the U.N. payment by the United States has been off the books and intentionally hidden from the American taxpayers. This chart will be very interesting to American taxpayers, I think, because it has some rather precise arithmetic, and I hope the camera can focus upon it. 
The information on this chart came from the official Department of Defense report for fiscal year 1997: $2,972,938,000 was stripped away from the training and the readiness of our U.S. armed forces and handed over to support the U.N. Security Council resolutions. This is nearly $3 billion, mind you, and it is in addition to the $902,102,000 the American taxpayers provided to the United Nations and its affiliated agencies and other international organizations, also, in addition to the $334,780,000 that the American taxpayers were forced to fork over for U.N. peacekeeping in fiscal year 1997. 
So, while the U.N. crybabies whine about not receiving 
enough of the American taxpayers' money, the real truth is that the United States volunteered more than three times what we were asked to pay; that is a total of $4,209,820,000 to the United Nations in fiscal year 1997. That is almost $3 billion which was taken off the books, courtesy of the American sailors, soldiers, airmen and marines. It was taken from them in terms of what should have been spent for their development in defense of this country. 
Most Americans do not even realize that billions of dollars are being siphoned away from the shrinking U.S. military budget to support the United Nations. In fact, most Americans have not the vaguest idea how much money the United States provides for the United Nations. In 1995, the United States--that is to say the American taxpayers--provided 30.7 percent of all of the United Nations peacekeeping costs, far more than any other country. That may have seemed fair in the 1950s, but it is out of line today. That is why Congress and the administration agreed to scale back U.S. payments for U.N. peacekeeping to 25 percent, and that is still far more than any other country pays. Yet, the crybabies continue to whine at the United Nations. 
But the United Nations ignores the will of Congress and continues to demand--not anything courteous about it at all--continues to demand that the United States pay the 30.7 percent of the peacekeeping costs. 
The United Nations calls this extra 5.7 percent add-on an `arrear.' They talk about arrearages, even though it represents hundreds of millions of dollars that we do not owe and that we should never pay, and I respectfully suggest that somebody should inform the international diplomatic corps that the United States controls the U.S. Government purse strings, not the United Nations. 
All of which reminds me of Sam Ervin, that great Senator from North Carolina, with whom I was honored to serve a couple of years before he retired. Senator Sam Ervin quoted a Latin proverb that seems apt. He said: `Small gifts make friends; great gifts make enemies.' And I can imagine what Senator Sam would be saying if he were still sitting right over there, if he were still around as a Member of the Senate, about what little impact the United States has had on the operations of the United Nations, in light of the total amount of millions and millions of dollars that we have paid to the United Nations, especially since Americans are being smothered under a $5,531,793,429,306.24 Federal debt as of March 23. 
Some Americans would mistakenly suppose that at least 25 percent of United Nations employees are American citizens, since the United States provides 25 percent of the budget and that the United Nations headquarters is in New York City. But only 7.1 percent of U.N. employees are U.S. citizens. Surely it is obvious that the Congress needs to pass and President Clinton needs to sign into law the U.N. reforms that Senator Joe Biden of Delaware and I negotiated and which were approved by this Senate last year by a vote of 90 to 5. 
Mr. President, I am going to close with one final thought. The administration spends a lot of time talking about how the United States has become the indispensable Nation in the post-cold war era, and I agree with that. But at the same time, the administration acts as if America is powerless to act in our own people's interest unless the United Nations is calling the tune. Small wonder that so many Americans are confused about U.S. foreign policy and the direction this country is heading internationally. 
No; let the record be clear--let the record be clear--America is anything but a deadbeat nation. The real problem is an administration that has allowed too many handout artists at the United Nations to go unchallenged in their arrogance. Mr. President, enough is enough. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Mr. HELMS.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute's report for the week ending March 20, that the U.S. imported 8,724,000 barrels of oil each day, 2,318,000 more barrels than the 6,406,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 57.6 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America s oil supply. 
Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S: now 8,724,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I commend to the attention of my colleagues a significant book entitled, `Death Knell of the Panama Canal?', by Capt. G. Russell Evans (USCG, Ret.). 
In this, his second book on the subject, Captain Evans sets forth the facts and his analysis of the skullduggery that led to the ill-conceived 1977 Panama Canal Treaties. 
The Panama Canal Treaties were a foolish giveaway of a critical waterway built with U.S. taxpayers' dollars. I vigorously opposed the 1977 treaties, and to this day I regret that the United States Senate approved them--by one vote. 
Madam President, the Panama Canal is essential to the continued economic and strategic health of the United States and many of our allies. In his introduction to the book, distinguished former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Thomas J. Moorer (USN, Ret.), writes that `about 95% of our routine logistics support goes by sea.' 
These military vessels, like their commercial counterparts, rely on the Canal to move quickly between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Since the United States began to hand over the Canal and its operations to Panamanian authorities, the maintenance of the Canal has slipped noticeably. The Canal is showing the effects of the neglect, and is now in a shocking state of disrepair. 
This essential maritime passage, a vital connection for international trade, is falling apart, and I fear that the deterioration of Canal facilities will increase as the Clinton Administration, following in the misguided path of the 1977 treaties, continues to hand over the Canal to Panamanian authorities. 
In light of the Panama Canal's critical importance, the United States simply cannot afford to squander the opportunity to secure access to facilities in the Canal Zone for our military to carry out essential missions and defend the security of the Canal. 
It is clearly in the best interests of both the United States and Panama to maintain a U.S. military presence there. The people of Panama consistently show, through opinion polls, that they do not want the United States to abandon its military bases. Without a U.S. presence, the Canal will be left undefended, this cannot be allowed to happen. 
Today, many former Carter Administration officials who engineered the Panama Canal giveaway in 1977 are serving in the Clinton Administration. Nevertheless, I will continue to press the Administration to reach a new agreement with the government of Panama to secure a U.S. military presence in that vital area. 
On September 5, 1996, the Senate approved my legislation, Senate Concurrent Resolution 14, urging the President to do just that. 
As Admiral Moorer states succinctly, `the clock is ticking,' and I believe Senators will find Captain Evans' book an invaluable reference to understanding the importance of the Canal--and the risks we run should the Canal fall into the wrong hands--or into disrepair.

Mr. HELMS. Madam President, the American Petroleum Institute's report for the week ending March 13, that the U.S. imported 6,636,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,213,000 fewer barrels than the 7,849,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
While this is one of the rare weeks when Americans imported slightly less oil than a year ago, Americans nonetheless relied on foreign oil for 50.8 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, half of the 20th century ago, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were consigned to communist domination because of expedient and short-sighted policies of the West. Less than a decade ago, communism was overthrown and the desire for freedom in Eastern Europe prevailed over totalitarian government. Dictatorships fell to democracy like falling leaves in Autumn. 
The new democracies in Eastern Europe, already nearing the state of permanent fixtures, have existed for less time than they did between World War I and World War II. Then, like now, their ultimate survival was taken for granted. 
Yet, even now, in the late twentieth century, European nations are again torn asunder by ethnic hatreds and religious division. Reconstruction of the empires of the past century--a century as bloody as any known to man--still plays prominently in the minds of some nationalists and despots. Today, as in 1949, the defense of democracy will keep the United States out of European wars. 
History may judge the collapse of communism in Europe to be largely a result of NATO's success in containing the massive, external threat posed by the Soviet Union. But the end of the Cold War does not mean the end of threats to freedom and liberty. 
In the famous words of Thomas Jefferson: `The price of liberty is eternal vigilance'. We must remain vigilant against the reemergence of old threats from the century past, even as we prepare for the new threats of the century to come. In the judgment of this Senator, an expanded NATO will do both. 
Thus, we consider today one of the more important foreign policy matters to come before the Senate in some time; the protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO. In approving this resolution the Senate has the opportunity to remedy this historical injustice of Yalta, to secure democracy in Central Europe, and to advance the national security interests of the United States of America. 
I confess that because the extension of security guarantees is a very serious undertaking, and should be made only when it is in the national security interests of the United States. 
Mr. President, the membership of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in the NATO alliance does serve the national security interests of the United States. I want to say why. 
The Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am chairman, and honored to be so, has given its utmost attention to this question. The Committee's examination of NATO expansion has taken place over the course of four years, and has included a dozen hearings and nearly fifty witnesses representing the full spectrum of views on this issue. We have published a hearing record alone that is 552 pages long. 
I extend my thanks to the many Foreign Relations Committee members who have taken this task so seriously, including Senator Biden, Lugar, Gordon Smith, and, of course, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel. I also commend Senator Bill Roth for his leadership in the 28-member Senate NATO Observer Group. In Fact, through the combined efforts of the Foreign Relations Committee and the NATO Observer Group, 41 Senators have had the opportunity to engage closely in the review of NATO enlargement over the course of the past year. 
The Resolution of Ratification was carefully written to address major areas of concern and to clarify issues that arose during the Committee's consideration. It is the product of a robust debate with the Administration--a debate that from the very start was premised upon my desire to be supportive of NATO expansion, but always guided by the necessity to achieve that goal in a manner that fully secures the interests of the United States. 
I insisted upon that, and I insist upon that to this day. And we have done that with the resolution which is now the pending business. 
That resolution, Mr. President, by the way, was approved by the Foreign Relations Committee 16 to 2, and it includes seven declarations and four conditions. In general, let me run down the list. 
In general, the resolution reiterates the vital national security interest of NATO membership for the United States; 
It lays out the strategic rationale for the inclusion of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in NATO; 
It calls for continued U.S. leadership of NATO without interference from other institutions such as the United Nations; 
It supports full and equal membership in NATO for the three new members; 
It encourages the development of a constructive relationship between NATO and the Russian Federation if the Russian Federation remains committed to democratic reforms; 
It emphasizes that Europeans also must work to advance political and economic stability in Europe; 
It emphasizes that while NATO is open to new members, the United States has not invited any new members at this time; 
It declares the Senate's understanding that NATO's central purpose remains the defense of its members and requires full consultation by the Executive Branch on any proposals to revise this mission; 
It requires the President to certify the Senate's understandings on the cost, benefits, and military implications of NATO enlargement and requires annual reports, for five years, on several key elements of Alliance burdensharing; 
It clearly defines the limits on the NATO-Russia relationship; and 
It reiterates the constitutionally-based principles of treaty interpretation and appropriate role of the Senate in the consideration of treaties. 
NATO expansion has been endorsed by a number of respected foreign policy leaders--past and present--e.g., former President George Bush, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Casper Weinberger, Dick Cheney, Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Richard Perle. It has the strong backing of foreign leaders of known moral courage and principle, including Margaret Thatcher, Lech Walesa, and Vaclav Havel. We have received messages of endorsement from every living Secretary of State, numerous former secretaries of defense and national security advisors, and over sixty flag and general officers including five distinguished former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
More important, we have heard from the American people. Organizations representing literally tens of millions of average Americans including the diverse ethnic community, religious groups, civic organizations, veterans organizations, and business groups support this measure. 
In 1949, when the Alliance was founded, the decision entailed some risks. The same is true today. But we who support an expanded NATO are convinced that the collective defense of democratic nations in Europe and North America serves the interests of our nation. 
A half century ago we found our allies in this cause among the ashes and ruin of World War II. Today, with the collapse of communism, we have found three new allies in the continued defense of democracy. 
If Europe is indeed on the threshold of an era of peace, as some suggest, then the inclusion of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in NATO will hardly merit a footnote in history. In fact, NATO will gradually fade from the scene as it relevance diminishes. But if the threat to liberty proves more resilient, how grateful we will be for these three allies. 
With the expansion of the NATO alliance, we have the opportunity to right an historical injustice. By accepting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO, we reconnect them to the democratic West--a union that was severed by first Hitler, then Stalin. All Americans should welcome these nations as they finally become equal partners in the community of democratic nations, thereby ensuring that their new democracies shall never again fall victim to tyranny. 
Mr. President, I believe this resolution will be approved with an overwhelmingly positive vote, an unmistakable vote of confidence for the democracies of Eastern Europe who, having been given a second chance at freedom this century, understand the price they must pay to preserve it. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it was just over two years ago--on Friday, February 23, 1996--that the federal debt broke the five trillion dollar sound barrier for the first time in history. The records show that on that day, at the close of business, the debt stood at $5,017,056,630,040.53. 
Just 22 years ago, in 1976, the federal debt stood at $629 billion,--and that was after the first 200 years of America's history had elapsed, including two world wars. Then the big spenders really went to work and the interest on the federal debt really began to take off--and, presto, during the past two decades the federal debt has soared into the stratosphere, increasing by more than $4 trillion in two decades (from 1976 to 1996). 
So, Mr. President, as of the close of business Monday, March 16, 1998, the federal debt stood--down-to-the-penny--at $5,530,456,190,863.05. 
This enormous debt is a festering, escalating burden on all citizens and especially it is jeopardizing the liberty of our children and grandchildren. As Jefferson once warned, `to preserve [our] independence, we must not let our leaders load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.' 
Was Mr. Jefferson right, or what?

One year ago, March 12, 1997, the federal debt stood at $5,361,483,000,000 (Five trillion, three hundred sixty-one billion, four hundred eighty-three million). 
Five years ago, March 12, 1993, the federal debt stood at $4,211,673,000,000 (Four trillion, two hundred eleven billion, six hundred seventy-three million). 
Twenty-five years ago, March 12, 1973, the federal debt stood at $455,864,000,000 (Four hundred fifty-five billion, eight hundred sixty-four million) which reflects a debt increase of more than $5 trillion--$5,073,886,398,747.62 (Five trillion, seventy-three billion, eight hundred eighty-six million, three hundred ninety-eight thousand, seven hundred forty-seven dollars and sixty-two cents) during the past 25 years.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I confess a measure of regret that it has taken the Congress this long to state the obvious in a clear and formal way that Saddam Hussein is a murderer, and should be brought to justice. I recall the occasion almost 10 years ago, when I stood on this Senate floor and condemned Saddam Hussein's crimes against his own people. Senator Pell, then the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I joined in offering amendment after amendment on various bills then being considered by the Senate. Senator Pell and I were dismayed that there seemed so little interest in calling the world's attention to the sadistic tyranny of Saddam Hussein. 
Mr. President, anyone who believes that Saddam is a man who `can be trusted', a man with whom we can `do business' and have a `human relationship' (I am quoting the Secretary General of the United Nations on these points), needs to be reminded not only of the 148 lives lost in combat in Desert Storm or of the 37 lives lost on the U.S.S. Stark, but also of those pitiful women and children of Iraqi Kurdistan who were deliberately burned beyond recognition by Saddam's chemical weapons. I remind them of the Anfal campaign and the city of Halabja, and the hideous deaths of tens of thousands of innocent people. 
Let's face it, Mr. President, Saddam Hussein is the world's worst and most treacherous nightmare. He is a brutal and totally unremorseful killer with weapons of mass destruction and he is willing to use them at the slightest provocation. 
Mr. President, we must not be deceived. Should Saddam Hussein escape the yoke of sanctions, he once again will begin to amass weapons. He will be a threat to the United States and the American people, and to our allies in the Middle East, and the people of Iraq. The Clinton Administration pretense that all that is needed are sanctions in order to face up to Saddam's threat is dangerous nonsense. Sanctions deal with weapons--but the question is, who is going to deal with Saddam--and how? 
It is past time to set in motion a process of gathering evidence, forming a tribunal, indicting and prosecuting Saddam Hussein. He is a war criminal. He is a murderer. Let there be an end to the pretense that installing cameras and finding biological weapons toxins will end our problems with Iraq. 
We need to get the weapons, yes. We also need, one way or another, to get Saddam.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Foreign Relations Committee recently received an alarming letter--which the State Department was required to send pursuant to Title IV of public law 105-118--explaining that the United Nations Population Fund (known as UNFPA) is renewing its highly controversial population control program in communist China. 
Surely, the most inhumane human rights abuses in China occur in the name of reducing its birth rate. Under Red China's population control regime, women who already have one child are forced to abort their babies, and forced to undergo sterilization procedures. Nazi Germany could not have designed a system more brutally efficient than China's--which systematically kills all but firstborn babies. And from the beginning, UNFPA has worked hand-in-glove with communist Chinese authorities. 
In fact, Presidents Reagan and Bush suspended funding for UNFPA precisely because of its activities in China, and it was not until President Clinton was sworn in (promising to keep abortions `safe, legal and rare') that UNFPA begin receiving U.S. taxpayer funds again. President Clinton's support for UNFPA has never wavered, even though China never backed off its forced abortion policy. 
So now you know, Mr. President, why the Administration occasionally gives lip service to the critics of China's brutal population control program, and why it occasionally assures Congress that it really does not want UNFPA in China. In fact, the Administration went so far as to put this in writing. 
I have at hand a letter from AID's Administrator, Brian Atwood, dated September 10, 1993, promising that, `. . . if there are not significant improvements in China's population program, the United States will not support continued UNFPA assistance to China beyond 1995 when the current program ends.' The same promise was made to other members of Congress. 
Mr. President, this promise is significant because decisions about UNFPA's programs are made by consensus by its Executive Board. In other words, as a leading contributor to UNFPA, and a member of its Executive Board, the United States had the opportunity and the wherewithal to veto a renewal of China's program. But the Clinton Administration refused to do so, despite promises made to Congress, and despite their own admission that China's population program has not made `significant improvements'. 
Consider the U.S. statement at UNFPA's Board meeting: `We believe that this program may have the potential to demonstrate clearly the efficacy and sustainability of volunteer, non-coercive family planning.' Mr. President, this is cheerleading. It is an endorsement rather than opposition, as promised. 
It is curious, Mr. President, that UNFPA's previous 15 year program in China failed to `demonstrate clearly the efficacy and sustainability of volunteer, non-coercive family planning'. Clearly, communist China sees nothing wrong with its policy of forced abortion. UNFPA's Executive Director actually praised communist China for `achievements' in controlling its population growth. For the State Department to pretend that UNFPA now cares whether China's program is coercive or not is dishonest.

Mr. HELMS. Madam President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending March 6, the U.S. imported 7,700,000 barrels of oil each day, 190,000 barrels more than the 7,510,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 54.9 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By U.S. producers using American workers? 
Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S: now 7,700,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leaders, but I am also deeply grateful to the able senior Senator from New York. For too long the government has classified information which has no business being classified. When I came to the Senate, I was a member of the Armed Services Committee and I remember that I went to many classified briefings, only to be informed, in great detail, of everything that was in the New York Times and Washington Post that morning. The most frustrating thing was that we could not talk about the information from those meetings because it was classified.

Mr. HELMS. The Commission by law had two goals: to study how to protect the important government secrets while simultaneously reducing the enormous amount of classified documents and materials. We began our deliberations with the premise that government secrecy is a form of regulation, and like all regulations, should be used sparingly. But I feel obliged to reiterate and emphasize the obvious. The protection of true national security information remains vital to the well-being and security of the United States.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as I speak, the countless friends of Joe Webb have been sadly saying farewell to him at services today in Raleigh and at Saint Matthews Church cemetery in Hillsborough, Joe's final resting place. 
Joseph Cheshire Webb, 83, died this past Friday afternoon after a distinguished career as trust officer for Wachovia Bank and Trust Company in Raleigh--which he had served for decades as head of that bank's trust department. 
But it was not merely Joe's able service as a highly respected banker that earned for him the wide circle of friends who were saddened by the news of his passing. 
Joe was thoughtful and caring without fail--and his sense of humor made him welcome everywhere he went. 
In other words, he was a genuinely good guy, a sincere and honorable friend. His service in the Navy during World War II, his participation in the civic and business life of Raleigh and the State of North Carolina, and the sincerity of his friendly personality earned for him the respect and affection of all who knew him. 
To all of us who knew Joe Webb well, he was what the late Senator Dick Russell of Georgia so often referred to as `one of Nature's Noblemen.' 
I am proud to have been his friend, Mr. President, and to have him as mine. I shall miss him.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending February 6, the U.S. imported 8,371,000 barrels of oil each day, 447,000 barrels more than the 7,894,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 56.8 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By U.S. producers using American workers? 
Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S: now 8,371,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senators Bond and Frist are to be commended in introducing the underlying legislation to ban human cloning and the creation of human embryos. Congress must make unmistakably clear that human life is too precious and valuable to be cheapened by a medical procedure which replicates human beings. 
Millions of Americans believe that human cloning is inconsistent with the moral responsibility that is incumbent upon modern medical technology. Put simply, so-called medical `advances' are not advances at all unless the dignity and sanctity of all human life are preserved. It is meaningful, I think, that the Senate's only physician has sponsored this bill. I appreciate Senator Frist's willingness to offer his medical expertise to the American people by setting the record straight about the travesty of human cloning. 
Mr. President, the overwhelming consensus among professionals in the medical industry confirms that human cloning is unethical and immoral. NIH Director Harold Vamus stated that he personally agrees with numerous polls evidencing the public's opinion that cloning human beings is `repugnant.' 
Indeed, Mr. President, the American people are outraged by the hubris of a fringe element of the medical community wishing to pursue human cloning--and they are demanding action. In fact, some states have already introduced similar legislation to the one before us that would ban human cloning. 
Perhaps this debate over human cloning was inevitable because, for too long, our society has failed to stand on the principle that all life has value. Nowhere has the lack of respect for human life been more evident than in the Supreme Court's tragic Roe v. Wade decision in 1973--the infamous case; which established that unborn children are expendable for reasons of convenience and social policy. Roe v. Wade presaged an era where science, technology and medicine are no longer confined to work within the moral boundaries erased by that ill-fated decision made twenty-five years ago. 
I'm sure most Americans were alarmed, as I was, when the Chicago physicist, Richard Seed, expressed his reasoning for wanting to clone a human being. Mr. Seed, states that he believes mankind should reach the level of supremacy as our Creator. Mark my words, a society that permits modern medicine to sacrifice human dignity for the sole purpose of such self-glorification will not survive its own arrogance. 
Those having doubts need only to consult their history books. Evidence of this can be seen throughout the course of history. It is instructive to read the book of Genesis and the account about a group from Babylon who became so enamored by technology that they believed they could build a structure, the infamous Tower of Babel, that would reach into heaven. The Lord punished the arrogance of this civilization and disrupted their foolish work. 
Some may say this is a story of irrelevance, but I believe it serves as a reminder of the ramifications to come if modern medicine is allowed to exceed beyond the moral boundaries and human limitations set by God. We should not be in the business of taking away life or creating life unnaturally. 
So, Mr. President, it is extremely important that the Senate pass this legislation to outlaw human cloning. In doing so, the Senate will heed the American people's belief that this objectionable procedure is a dangerous precedent and a morally abhorrent use of medical technology.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as we move into a vote on final passage, it still seems somehow impossible that 23 years have passed since that genial American--the one who had starred in movies and television, who early in his career had been a talented sports broadcaster, who served as a commissioned officer during World War II and who had served with distinction as Governor of California--that this remarkable man yielded to the urgings of thousands of his fellow Americans and tossed his hat in the ring for consideration as the 1976 Republican presidential nominee. 
But in the instance of Ronald Reagan, history proves that tempus does fugit. It has indeed been 23 years. Ronald Reagan has done all of the above, and done them well. But when he agreed to be a candidate for the Presidential nomination, there were few who foresaw the profound effect this remarkable American would have on his party, his country--and the entire world. 
Mr. Reagan did not, of course, win the nomination in 1976. But he did lay the groundwork for 1980 when delighted Republicans chose him as the party's standard bearer in the presidential election that year. 
He won overwhelmingly and, as Paul Harvey always says, now you know the rest of the story. 
Mr. President, I had known Ronald Reagan for some years when he announced in 1976--the year when I was in the middle of my first six years in the U.S. Senate. Like Mr. Reagan I had once been a registered Democrat--and I confess that I was stunned on that November 1992 evening when the election returns were coming in that I had become the first U.S. Senator ever elected by the people of North Carolina. 
I was disappointed in 1976 when Mr. Reagan failed to win the GOP primary for president because it seemed clear to me then, and clear to millions of others, that Ronald Reagan was an eloquent and forceful defender of conservative values. For that reason, and because of my friendship with him, I became the first sitting Senator in 1976 to endorse Candidate Reagan for the Presidency--a fact that I shall forever note with pride because history is already clear that Mr. Reagan was the outstanding President of the 20th Century. 
There have been others who served well but it was President Ronald Reagan who stout-heartedly defended Thomas Jefferson's counsel that the least government is the best government. 
Indeed, the enormity of President Reagan's domestic achievement boggles the mind. Consider the unprecedented Gross National Product expansion and job creation after a period of failed statist economic policies; declining interest rates that allowed entrepreneurs to enter the market, bringing energy and innovation to countless industries; tax cuts that at long last allowed Americans to keep more of what they earned; a long overdue hiatus in the unchecked growth of the federal bureaucracy. Simply put, our economy is strong and vibrant today because Ronald Reagan had the courage to trust the free market. 
Ronald Reagan did all of this, yes, but the real heart of his legacy will forever rest upon in his courageous opposition to communism and totalitarianism opposition that led to the birth of freedom in Eastern Europe and the end of the Cold War. 
Two years before the remarkable fall of the Berlin Wall, Ronald Reagan traveled to Berlin, stood at the Brandenburg Gate, and thundered: `As long as this gate is closed, as long as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand, it is not the German question alone that remains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind.' 
In this cynical age, when so many ridicule anyone attempting to divine the difference between right and wrong, Ronald Reagan dared to believe in democracy. It was, perhaps, 
his old-fashioned belief in the goodness of America and all that it represented that led him to understand what so many so-called experts failed to understand: that the Cold War was a struggle not of military might or economic theory, but of the human spirit's longing to be free. 
President Reagan never lacked detractors--it seems there is no easier way to arouse scorn than to stand up for traditional values--but even his most vociferous opponents stood in awe of his amazing rhetorical gifts. They called him the `Great Communicator.' But President Reagan--with his typical humility--rejected the moniker. In his farewell address to the Nation, delivered on January 11, 1989, he said: 
I never thought it was my style or the words I used that made a difference: it was the content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things, and they didn't spring full bloom from my brow, they came from the heart of a great nation--from our experience our wisdom, and our belief in the principles that have guided us for two centuries. They called it the Reagan revolution. And I'll accept that, but for me it always seemed more like the great rediscovery, a rediscovery of our values and our common sense. 
Indeed, the Reagan years were a reclamation of traditional principles. And all Americans owe Ronald Reagan a great debt, one that the simple renaming of an airport doesn't begin to repay. But this does not lessen the importance that the name of Ronald Reagan be enshrined in national institutions. 
In the same farewell address to which I referred a moment ago, President Reagan issued a warning for those who would forget history. `If we forget what we did,' he said, `we won't know who we are.' He spoke of an `eradication * * * of the American memory that could result, ultimately, in an erosion of the American spirit.' 
This Friday, Ronald Reagan will be 87 years old. All of us are saddened by his illness, but we are inspired by the gracious manner in which he and his family have faced it. And while he is still with us, we should heed his admonishment to remember the values he stood for, the President he was, and the man that he is. 
Today, our classrooms and our universities are a battlefield of revisionist history and sometimes venomous ideology. But long after today's petty scholastic disputes lie forgotten in the pages of some academic journal, the Washington Monument, and the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials, and other national shrines will continue to stand in tribute to achievements of great Americans. 
Ronald Reagan richly deserves to be remembered for his achievements just as earlier great American patriots are remembered. I am proud to support the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and I hope that Americans will accept this gesture of deep and genuine appreciation.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, a troubling aspect in assessing all aspects of maintaining a strong U.S. national security is one that receives scant attention--the fact that the United States is more deeply dependent upon foreign countries to supply most of America's energy needs. The situation today is worse than ever before in our history. 
I began in 1996 my reports to the American people every week in which I stated the precise amount of oil imported by the U.S. from foreign countries. Some of these countries are openly hostile to U.S. interests. I make these reports to emphasize the extent to which the U.S. has become perilously dependent on them. 
I investigated this issue a decade ago when I presided over several hearings as the then chairman of the Agriculture Committee. In my present capacity as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee we have held hearings; more are scheduled this year. 
While the Administration acknowledges that U.S. oil imports are a national security concern, nothing has been done by the Administration to resolve U.S. dependency on foreign oil. 
Now, Mr. President, a few up-to-date statistics: The American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending January 23, the U.S. imported 7,776,000 barrels of oil each day, 64,000 barrels fewer than the 7,840,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
While this is one of the rare weeks when Americans imported slightly less oil than a year ago, Americans still relied on foreign oil for 55 percent of their needs last week, and there is no sign that the upward spiral will abate. 
Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Which raises the inevitable question: is anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by U.S. producers using American workers? 
It is argued that America should use up foreign oil reserves before tapping into our the remaining U.S. domestic supply. But I submit, Mr. President, that economic calamity will occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S: now 7,776,000 barrels a day. 
Mr. President, the Foreign Relations Committee will continue its examination of U.S. dependency on foreign oil in 1998. I shall also continue to report to the Senate--and to the American people--on a regular basis regarding this increasingly dangerous trend.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, my purpose today is to discuss a highly disturbing pattern of abuse and professional misconduct by members of the U.S. Foreign Service and a grievance process that does not adequately penalize individuals who engage in such actions. 
This week, Mr. President, I wrote to our friend, the distinguished Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, regarding the investigation that I have instructed the Foreign Relations Committee staff to undertake during the coming months. 
It will be instructive to examine the serious allegations--all documented by the State Department's Inspector General--that have come to my attention during the Foreign Relation Committee's routine review of ambassadorial appointments and the Foreign Service promotion lists submitted to the Senate by the White House. 
Now, perhaps the most serious allegation that so far has been brought to my attention involves a United States Ambassador--a career Foreign Service officer, who was forced to resign his ambassadorial post for repeated episodes of sexually harassing female employees under his supervision. 
This case was documented by the State Department Inspector General in a 26 page report made available to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
In response, the Secretary of State promptly and properly fired this Ambassador this past September. Yet to this day, the U.S. Agency for International Development--our Government's $6 billion foreign aid giveaway agency--continues to employ this former ambassador and, to date, has recommended no reprimand whatsoever for his actions. 
The abuses, Mr. President, do not end there. In another instance, a Foreign Service officer in India provided visas to foreign female applicants in return for sex. This reprehensible behavior led to the officer's being suspended without pay for five days. However, the suspension was in effect during the Christmas holiday; therefore his co-workers were unaware of his having been suspended. 
Incredibly, Mr. President, despite this gross misconduct and abuse of taxpayers' trust, the Foreign Service officer has been recommended for promotion by the President Clinton of the United States. 
In another case, four Foreign Service officers in Manila carried out an elaborate scheme to divert $94,200 in federal government funds to build a squash and racquetball court. For this fraud--which forced the U.S. embassy into violation of U.S. anti-deficiency laws--these Foreign Service officers each received mere seven day suspensions. (and at least one of them has been recommended for promotion!) 
In yet another case, a Foreign Service officer remains in the employ of the State Department even after having twice pleaded guilty to, and being convicted of, theft of State Department funds. 
The Director General of the Foreign Service recommended that the officer be fired but the Foreign Service Grievance Board (made up of colleagues of the guilty employee) overruled the Director General and overturned the officer's termination. The Secretary of State at the time rightly sought to overrule the Grievance Board, but the courts ruled that the Foreign Service Act of 1980 did not give the Secretary authority to overrule the Grievance Board. 
So something is amiss, and I for one propose to try to do something about it because the list goes on and on. 
A senior career USIA Foreign Service officer in Bangkok, Thailand, falsified an $18,000 grant and thereby violated agency guidelines by approving an expenditure of $19,000 to repair her personal residence. And what do you suppose the officer's penalty was? A one-day suspension! Moreover, after all of that, this FSO was recommended by the President for promotion to the highest ranking Foreign Service position within USIA, despite strong objections from the USIA Inspector General. And to add further insult to American taxpayers, this officer, to this day, has never even been required to repay the stolen $18,000. 
By this point, I suspect most Americans would be appalled by such outrageous misbehavior. So, my final example involves a senior career USIA Foreign Service officer nominated by the President to serve as a U.S. ambassador even though the officer received two letters of admonishment for violating USIA regulations. 
Despite these letters of admonishment--one for nepotism in 1990, and a second, in 1991, for engaging in extramarital affairs with two journalists while carrying out official U.S. government activities supported by the taxpayers--USIA did not suspend this officer for his actions. 
I informed the Secretary of State in my letter that I fear these cases may be merely the tip of a very corrupt iceberg. The fact is that the Department of State continues to employ, and the White House continues to recommend to the Senate for promotion, Foreign Service officers who not only have grossly abused the trust placed in them by American taxpayers, but who, when judged by their peers, have received only the lightest of punishment. 
While these abuses themselves are, to say the least, unacceptable, so too are the Foreign Service's responses to them. As I understand it, allowing these individuals--who have committed moral, ethical, and/or professional abuses, or who have defrauded the Federal Government--to remain unscathed in their jobs is being tolerated under the arcane, self-protecting Foreign Service employment laws. I propose to try to do something about that. 
More startling, perhaps, is that the Foreign Service and the President continue to recommend some of these individuals for promotion! 
I have recommended to Secretary Albright that we work together to address this issue in legislation. Specifically the Foreign Relations Committee will examine the numerous moral, ethical, and professional lapses of Foreign Service officers and the personnel grievance process to determine whether the cases I have referenced are symptomatic of more severe and pervasive behavior within the Foreign Service. I suspect that deeper investigation will, in fact, show just how widespread these abuses are. 
I assure you, Mr. President, that the Foreign Relations Committee will review the punishment given to those Foreign Service officers violating U.S. laws and regulations and how that punishment compares to the way in which similar cases are resolved involving military officers in the Department of Defense and other career officers in federal agencies. The Committee will study the Grievance Board process and recommend necessary amendments to the laws governing the Foreign Service and its grievance procedures. 
Mr. President, the point is this, and I shall conclude on this note. 
Americans deserve the finest diplomatic representation around the world. Our nation is ill-served when the U.S. career diplomatic corps tolerates moral, ethical, and professional abuses within its ranks and fails adequately to deal with those who are guilty of such abuses. 
I say again, Mr. President, that it is my intent to find out the full scope of all of this and to try to do something about it. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senators may be intrigued to learn that during the 74 days Congress was in recess, the federal debt increased by more than $57 billion. 
To be exact, the increase (from November 13, 1997 to January 26, 1998) totaled $57,033,087,681.31 (Fifty-seven billion, thirty-three million, eighty-seven thousand, six hundred eighty-one dollars and thirty-one cents). 
This increase is a blunt reminder that even when Congress takes a break, the federal debt does not. The federal debt will continue to soar unless and until Congress changes the status quo. Presently, each citizen's share of the national debt is $20,424.89. 
Mr. President, with this in mind, let me begin where we left off: 
At the close of business yesterday, Monday, January 26, 1998, the federal debt stood at $5,487,280,357,810.54 (Five trillion, four hundred eighty-seven billion, two hundred eighty million, three hundred fifty-seven thousand, eight hundred ten dollars and fifty-four cents). 
Five years ago, January 26, 1993, the federal debt stood at $4,171,138,000,000 (four trillion, one hundred seventy-one billion, one hundred thirty-eight million). 
Ten years ago, January 26, 1998, the federal debt stood at $2,448,079,000,000 (Two trillion, four hundred forty-eight billion, seventy-nine million). 
Fifteen years ago, January 26, 1983, the federal debt stood at $1,196,856,000,000 (One trillion, one hundred ninety-six billion, eight hundred fifty-six million). 
Twenty-five years ago, January 26, 1973, the federal debt stood at $449,476,000,000 (Four hundred forty-nine billion, four hundred seventy-six million) which reflects a debt increase of over $5 trillion--$5,037,804,357,810.54 (Five trillion, thirty-seven billion, eight hundred four million, three hundred fifty-seven thousand, eight hundred ten dollars and fifty-four cents) during the past 25 years.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the North Carolina General Assembly embarked in 1997 on a significant course--that of inviting some of our State's best-known and best-qualified citizens to address joint sessions of the legislature's house and senate. Dr. Billy Graham, for example, made a remarkable and unforgettable appearance during the year. 
Meanwhile, the North Carolina General Assembly's Select Committee on Federal Education grants heard a splendid address by a prominent and learned North Carolina lady, Mrs. Alice Wynne Gatsis, of Rocky Mount, whose distinguished husband is a retired general of the U.S. Army, Andrew J. Gatsis. 
General and Mrs. Gatsis are stouthearted defenders of the U.S. Constitution. They are exceedingly knowledgeable about the perils confronting this Nation as a result of constant tampering with the intent and the meaning of the Constitution. In short, Alice Wynne Gatsis and her husband understand the miracle of America. 
That, Mr. President, is why the North Carolina General Assembly's Select Committee on Federal Education Grants invited Mrs. Gatsis to address the committee on November 10 of last year. 
Mr. President, I have in hand the text of Mrs. Gatsis' address and, being enormously impressed with her remarks, I have decided to share them with Senators and others who read the Congressional Record.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this past week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held its final business meeting of the 1st session of the 105th Congress. At that meeting, the committee approved 50 nominations as well as three pieces of legislation. This was the culmination of an ambitious 1997 agenda which included 97 committee meetings--the first on January 8 when the committee convened to consider the nomination of Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State. 
With this past week's business meeting, the committee had approved and sent to the Senate, in 1997, 119 nominations, approved 1,004 Foreign Service promotions and reported out 37 pieces of legislation, while approving 15 treaties. Among the nominations were the Secretary of State, numerous Assistant Secretaries of State, and Ambassadors to the United Nations, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Greece, Korea, Israel, and Egypt. 
But this, Mr. President, does not begin to tell the full story. Thanks to the able members of the committee staff, hard work of the committee members--the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members--and thanks to the bipartisan spirit which we, all of us, have worked to establish, we have--all of us together--succeeded, in the opinion of, at least, two former Secretaries of State, in returning the Foreign Relations Committee to top-drawer relevancy for the first time in decades. I believe it is fair to say that, thanks to the joint efforts of so many, the committee is today a force to be reckoned with in terms of U.S. foreign policy. 
Mr. President, the most concrete evidence of this rejuvenation came in May and June, when the committee wrote and approved sweeping bipartisan legislation to reorganize and revitalize the U.S. foreign policy apparatus, and reform the United Nations. This bill passed the Senate by an overwhelming 90 to 5 vote stipulating the abolishment of two antiquated temporary Federal agencies--the U.S. Information Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency--and brings another--the Agency for International Development--under the authority of the Secretary of State. 
And, just as importantly, it strikes a grand bargain regarding the United Nations, paying $819 million in so-called U.S. arrears in exchange for deep-seated and meaningful U.N. reforms. 
In addition, since the August recess, the full committee, and its various subcommittees, have convened literally dozens of hearings on a wide range of foreign policy matters. During the fall months, the committee began hearings on what will surely be next year's most important foreign policy debate: The expansion of the NATO alliance. 
The committee has already held six hearings--beginning with testimony from Secretary of State Albright--hearings which I believe will have a real impact in ensuring not only that NATO expansion is approved by the Senate next spring, but that the plan presented to the Senate for its advice and consent is done the right way, taking into account the legitimate concerns various Senators have presented. 
It is difficult for me to express in any adequate way my gratitude to the members of this committee for all their efforts this past year. The chairmen and ranking members of the various subcommittees have done splendid work in the consideration of all the nominations, the bilateral tax treaties that are so important to American industry, and to hold oversight hearings on so many important matters. 
It is because of their work--not Senator Biden's nor mine--that this committee has been restored to the world stage as an important player in American foreign policy. I am proud of them and, it has been a privilege to serve with them on the Foreign Relations Committee.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am gratified that Congress is today passing legislation to promote the adoption of children in foster care. This legislation is not perfect, but it does clarify that it is in the best interest of every child--regardless of his or her age, race or special need--to be raised by a family who will provide a safe, permanent, and nurturing home. 
Congress should be unmistakably clear in expressing this judgment: Foster care children should not be returned to unfit, abusive parents; and the barriers that currently prevent the adoption of foster care children must be lifted. Believe me, Mr. President, there is no shortage of prospective parents. The National Council for Adoption estimates that 2 million couples are waiting to adopt a child. Nonetheless, each year 15,000 children reach adulthood and leave the foster care system without ever becoming part of a permanent home. 
Because the current Federal law requires States to make reasonable efforts to reunite children with their biological parents, children have tragically been returned to their abusive and sometimes murderous parents. 
Under this adoption-foster care bill, States are not required to make reasonable efforts to reunite children with parents who have murdered another child; committed a felony assault that results in serious bodily injury to a child; or who pose a serious risk to a child's life. 
Foster care children who can never return safely home should not be left to linger in the foster care system--which, after all, is supposed to be temporary. Instead, these children should be placed up for adoption, and the parental rights of abusive parents should be terminated so adoption can take place. 
Let me be clear, parents who use reasonable discipline in rearing their children are not the parents who should have their rights terminated. This legislation includes language to ensure that reasonable discipline--such as reasonable spanking--is not misinterpreted as an act of abuse. Therefore, no State agency or court shall disrupt a home where parents use reasonable discipline. 
What we are talking about, Mr. President, are children who have been taken out of their homes because they've been truly abused and neglected. But because of current Federal law, these children are not being placed up for adoption--but are growing up in foster care. The numbers speak for themselves. There are more than half a million children currently living in foster care--an alarmingly high number which illustrates how the foster care system is in disarray. 
Is it not the responsibility of our civilized society to ensure the safety and well-being of these vulnerable children by promoting adoption? And shouldn't we provide couples willing to love and care for these children the opportunity to do so? I believe the answer is clearly yes.

Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I have a bill, S. 1397, at the desk. Now, Senators DeWine, Faircloth, Glenn, and I are introducing this legislation, and we are naming it the Centennial of Flight Commemorative Act. As I indicated, the bill number is S. 1397. 
This significant legislation will establish a commission to assist the numerous events that will lead up to and include the celebration of the 100th anniversary of powered flight, a feat in all the history books, accomplished in my State of North Carolina by the geniuses, two brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright, Ohio brothers who were born and raised in Dayton where they operated a bicycle shop. 
I don't know whether you have been to Kitty Hawk, particularly in the middle of December, but it is not a comfortable place to be. Wilbur and Orville came to the Outer Banks of North Carolina to conduct their experiments. The first powered flight occurred at Kitty Hawk, NC, on December 17, 1903. In fact, the Wright brothers engaged in four flights that day, and with their effort they changed the concept of travel forever. 
About noon on that cold and windy December day, at Kitty Hawk, NC, the aviation age, the air age, began. 
So, Madam President, the Wright brothers were indisputably the first pioneers of powered flight, and they became national heroes, justifiably etched in history. 
As for our bill, S. 1397, the able Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, and the able Senator from Ohio, Mr. Glenn, did excellent work in drafting this legislation. 
Senator Glenn, I am obliged to mention, and I am glad to do so, is a man of history himself in terms of powered flight. He was the first American, as all of us know, to orbit the Earth. When he walks up and down the corridors, I see mamas and daddies pointing to him saying, `That's Senator Glenn.' Senator Glenn and six other pioneers, the Mercury astronauts, got America's space program off the ground. 
Madam President, S. 1397--let me say the title again so it will register--the Centennial of Flight Commemorative Act--proposes the establishment of a commission of 21 individuals to plan for and assist in events leading up to and including the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers' flights at Kitty Hawk. The commission will be composed of the Secretary of the Interior, the Director of the National Air and Space Museum, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, the NASA Administrator, and each of these officials can name a designee. Then there will be two representatives each from the States of North Carolina and Ohio and 12 other private citizens. 
Of these 12 private citizens, the President of the United States will appoint two from a list recommended by the Senate majority leader in consultation with the Senate minority leader, and two from a list recommended by the Speaker of the House in consultation with the House minority leader. The remaining eight will be chosen based on qualifications and/or experience in the fields of history, aerospace, science, industry, or other professions that will enhance the work of the commission. 
The commission will represent the United States and take a leadership role with other nations in recognizing the achievement of the Wright brothers and the importance of aviation history. 
The commission's activities will be closely coordinated with the First Flight Centennial Commission and the First Flight Centennial Foundation of North Carolina and the 2003 Committee of the State of Ohio. The commission is allowed to retain an executive director and staff that may be required in order to carry out its functions.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending October 31, the United States imported 7,986,000 barrels of oil each day, 948,000 barrels more than the 7,038,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 55.6 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By U.S. producers using American workers? 
Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 7,986,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I am pleased that the committee has reported favorably Senate Concurrent Resolution 48, expressing the sense of the Congress regarding proliferation of missile technology from Russia to Iran. 
The committee held a hearing on alleged Russian ballistic missile proliferation activities with Iran on October 8, but the committee did not hold a specific hearing on Senate Concurrent Resolution 48. The resolution was placed on the agenda of the committee's business meeting for October 9, 1997. During the business meeting several members of the committee raised questions about the intent, scope, and implication of the resolution. Desirous of maintaining consensus, I postponed consideration of the resolution until the questions were answered. 
Specifically, questions arose regarding paragraph (2) of section (1) of the resolution. After consultation, the sponsors and co-sponsors of Senate Concurrent Resolution 48 agreed with the committee that the resolution does not raise, suggest, or recommend reassessment of those programs which are in the national security interests of the United States. Accordingly, in the committee's view this interpretation removes from consideration, under this resolution, any ongoing programs and projects currently being conducted by the United States which seek to reduce the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their materials and know-how, as well as associated means of delivery. The resolution is also not intended to affect cooperative space programs between the United States and Russia. Nor is the resolution intended to affect humanitarian assistance or the programs of the National Endowment for Democracy, which promote democracy and market economic principles. Finally, the committee intends that the responsibility for making the determination regarding the adequacy of the Russian response under paragraph (2) lies with the President.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending October 24, the United States imported 7,482,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,104,000 barrels more than the 8,586,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 54 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By U.S. producers using American workers? 
Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 7,482,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair and I thank the managers of the bill. 
Mr. President, we have been working with Senator McCain and Senator Hollings and their staffs and, of course, William Kennard. I met with him for some time in my office. Mr. Kennard is the nominee to be Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, as you know. Now, all of us--and I think it is fair to include Mr. Kennard--want to rectify an awkward and unjustifiable situation that has developed in the Federal Communications Commission process of awarding broadcast licenses. Specifically, in this case, a well-known and highly respected and popular broadcasting executive in Asheville, NC, was curiously disqualified in his application for an FM frequency in the Asheville area. There was a lot of resentment in the public about that. 
What happened, Mr. President, was that this gentleman, Zeb Lee, of Asheville, and 12 other groups, had applied for the FM frequency when it became available in 1987. The Commission's comparative hearing process, in effect at that time, was used to determine which group would be the most qualified for the frequency. 
Zeb Lee had run station WSKY-AM in Asheville for 46 years, during which time he did the play-by-play for about 4,000 high school football games, and by sponsoring such public interest things as an Elvis Presley concert in 1955, which I would not have listened to, but most people did want to hear it. But he made so many innovations in broadcasting that he became just a household word, in terms of his name. He is enormously popular to this day. 
Well, Mr. President, in 1989, a 20-day hearing was held during which an FCC administrative law judge disqualified most of the other applicants because the judge ruled that they either lacked experience, didn't have transmitter facilities ready to go, or were basing their application purely on provisions favoring minorities--women and others. The judge found for the Lees, ruling in their favor on May 4, 1990. The judge found that the Lees were the most qualified, citing their stewardship of the AM station and Mr. Lee's commitment of involvement in the day-to-day management of the station. The FCC then favored active involvement by owners in the day-to-day operations of a radio station, as opposed to passive investors who would not be active managers. I think that is the way to go, as a former broadcaster. 
In any case, Mr. President, in addition to the first ruling in favor of Zeb Lee and his people, on April 8, 1991, the FCC Review Board affirmed the administrative law judge's ruling. And then on February 28, 1992, the FCC released its first decision favoring the Lees and a second decision also favoring the Zeb Lee application was released, I believe, on November 23, 1992. 
So on June 14, 1993, the FCC released a third ruling favoring the Lees. 
Well, Mr. President, you might say, `Why is Helms going to speak today talking about this nominee and this situation in Asheville, NC.?' 
The FCC granted a construction permit to the Lees on April 30, 1993, following which they began the construction process. So it went through a series of regulatory twist and turns in which the Lees complied with every order and requirement issued by the FCC and the administrative law judge, who stipulated that Mr. Lee must dispose of his AM station as a condition for acquiring that FM license--which Mr. Lee did. Amazingly, on June 18 of this year, the FCC which had reversed itself on June 2, forced the Lees off the air. 
Zeb Lee has asked the U.S. Court of Appeals to examine the manner in which the FCC handled his application, which led to his being taken off the air. The court will shortly issue a decision in the near future. 
Mr. President since April 30, 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals in the Bechtel case of December 17, 1993, struck down the `comparative process' that had been used to determine allocations of radio and television frequencies. The court directed the FCC to come up with new comparative standards. The Lees and about 25 to 30 other people were affected by this decision. 
But their cases have been frozen ever since. Additionally, a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which went into effect July 1, required that all radio and television frequencies be subject to auction. This provision concerned me because Zeb Lee's case and another 25 to 30 cases were in the pipeline and could be subject to auction which nobody anticipated. 
I find no fault with the provision in the balanced budget legislation, but it crept in the back door on Mr. Lee and the others.

Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. 
Senators should note that Mr. Kennard clearly feels the FCC can conduct hearings on this small group and class of applicants using new comparative criteria. 
In any event, Mr. President, I then consulted and wrote to the able chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, Mr. McCain, seeking assurance that Senator McCain now agrees that the provisions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 do not prohibit the FCC from using the comparative process in these 25 or 30 cases.

Mr. President, I have been given assurances satisfactory to me by Mr. Kennard that he will, within statute and regulation, work in good faith with me and others to resolve the problems the Bechtel decision caused. 
I was very impressed when Mr. Kennard came to my office and met with me about 3 weeks ago. I appreciate his voluntary assurance that he will work with us on the Zeb Lee case. Therefore, Mr. President, I support the nomination, and I am going to ask for the yeas and nays. I hope that he will be confirmed unanimously by the Senate.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I, Senator Faircloth, Senator Lott, Senator Breaux, Senator Hollins, Senator Bingaman, Senator Brownback, and Senator Inouye are submitting today a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which commends the administration for its actions in attempting to end the Japanese blockade of American ships who wish to use Japanese port facilities. We are also urging the administration to remain firm and stand behind the Federal Maritime Commission in these negotiations with the Government of Japan. 
This issue is a no brainer. The Japanese are simply throwing up a blockade against American ships, who seek to dock at Japanese ports. 
Mr. President, this protectionist stand has increased cost of shipping for the American consumer and all American ocean carriers and their customers. We simply will not tolerate that kind of treatment from Japan or any other trading partner. 
The Federal Maritime Commission is to be commended for taking a tough line toward the Japanese port authorities. We encourage the administration to stand squarely behind the Commission's efforts to achieve fairness for American ships, especially because we allow the Japanese open access to our ports. 
There is the Biblical saying of `Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.' The Japanese version is the complete reverse of that. 
We accommodate Japanese shipping and we should expect no less of them. 
Mr. President, I urge the Senate to swiftly adopt this resolution.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I too am pleased to be an original cosponsor of Senator Ford's bill, titled the Long-term Economic Assistance for Farmers Act (S. 1310). The able senior Senator from Kentucky is to be commended for offering this legislation. 
Mr. President, as farmers and rural communities in tobacco-growing States come to terms with the national tobacco settlement, this bill will address some of the needs sure to arise during this critical economic adjustment period. I believe this legislation is a good starting point for helping these farmers, their families, and their communities. 
Obviously, it is too much to hope that everybody affected by the settlement will be satisfied with every provision in this bill, but it is important that we begin to take steps to ensure farmers the same stability and predictability that the tobacco companies sought when they negotiated the national tobacco settlement. 
Mr. President, let me make it clear that--and I believe Senator Ford and all other supporters of this legislation agree--that this is only a starting point. It may be--after consultation with growers, companies and other affected parties--that only minor changes in this legislation need to be made. Or, it may be--that a significant overhaul in our approach to this issue is needed. 
Whatever the future holds, of this tobacco growers may be assured: I will do everything proper in my power to protect their interests. I have often been criticized for standing up for the livelihoods of tobacco farmers--and I suppose I will be criticized many times more in the future. Let the critics proceed, but I shall never retreat from my convictions that the hard-working families deserve to be recognized for the good citizens and splendid families that they are. 
So, Mr. President, again I commend my friend from Kentucky, Mr. Ford, for his tireless effort to protect tobacco farmers, and I am honored to stand with him once again.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending October 17, the United States imported 7,927,000 barrels of oil each day, 204,000 barrels less than the 8,131,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
While this is one of the few weeks that Americans imported less oil than the same week a year ago, Americans still relied on foreign oil for 55.4 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending October 3, the United States imported 9,492,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,607,000 barrels more than the 7,885,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 59.9 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil by U.S. producers using American workers? 
Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 9,492,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, criticism of and attacks on the tobacco industry--and, by implication, tobacco growers--has become a sort of one-upmanship cottage industry among politicians who, in earlier days, scrambled to pay their respects to those engaged in growing tobacco and manufacturing it. The name of the game is `piling on' and the political types are doing it with gusto. 
Last month, Mr. President, Dot Helms and I attended a meeting of the Burley and Dark Leaf Tobacco Association at Williamsburg. The distinguished speaker at the dinner was Fred Barnes, one of today's most respected journalists. 
Presiding at the dinner was an impressive young lady, Pem Pfisterer Clark, general manager of the Stemming District Tobacco Association in Henderson, KY. 
During the program, Ms. Clark recited a touching poem she had written about tobacco farmers. To those of us whose States produce tobacco, so heatedly maligned by its turncoat one-time friends, Pem Clark's tribute to these farmers was something that needed saying--and she said it well.

Mr. HELMS. I am grateful to the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] and the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] for their having introduced the pending amendment. They are to be commended for offering this proposal, which will improve the circumstances of many students who live in the District of Columbia, and who want to escape--and no other word really fits--escape the horrific conditions that exist in so many local public schools. 
I would say to my friends from Indiana and Connecticut that it takes a lot of courage to stand up against the public education establishment. They're a powerful bunch, the National Education Association crowd, and they're not afraid to use all of their muscle to oppose any effort to help parents find alternatives to failing public school systems. 
Those who have examined the appalling state of the D.C. public schools are fully aware that parents need an alternative to the status quo. On February 20 of this year, even the Washington Post reported the following dismaying statistics: 
Sixty-five percent of D.C. public school children tested below their grade levels for reading in the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills. 
Seventy-two percent of fourth-graders in the D.C. public schools tested below the `basic proficiency' level on the National Assessment of Education Progress test given to students every 2 years--this was the lowest score of any school system in the country. 
The dropout rate among D.C. public schools students is an astounding 40 percent. 
Meanwhile, even those that graduate are unprepared. More than half of D.C. public school graduates who take the U.S. Armed Forces Qualification Test scored below 50 percent on the test--that's a failing grade, Mr. President. That might be the saddest statistic of all. These young people--who want to better their lives through association with our armed forces--cannot pass the vocational aptitude exam given to aspiring recruits because the D.C. public schools are not properly preparing them. 
So, Mr. President, the list goes on and on. The Heritage Foundation reports that 11 percentage of students in the D.C. public school system avoid school because they fear for their own safety. Isn't that sad, Mr. President? Children in our Nation's Capital are afraid to go to school. 
Then again, why wouldn't they be afraid? Sixteen percent of the students in the D.C. public schools have at one time carried a weapon into their school. There are metal detectors at many if not all schools to prevent pistols, switchblade knives and narcotics from being smuggled into the classrooms. 
Nor is it just the students who are afraid. Almost one in five D.C. public school teachers report that verbal abuse from their students is a serious problem. With conditions like these, no wonder student performance is so low. 
Mr. President, again I congratulate Senator Coats and Senator Lieberman for offering this amendment, which opens up the alternative of private or parochial schools to parents whose family income is below 185 percent of the poverty level. Their plan provides opportunity scholarships of up to $3,200 for parents who are fed up with the education--or, rather, the lack of education--provided by the D.C. public schools. 
Mr. President, there is a lot of misinformation swirling about concerning the high cost of private and parochial schools. When the words private school are mentioned, the image of elite and high-priced education often springs to mind. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
In fact, there is a vast and accessible network of private schools in the Washington area. My friend, the Senator from Indiana, informs me that there are 60 private schools in this area that cost less than $3,200 a year--the amount that families living below the poverty level can receive under the Coats/Lieberman amendment. 
Of these 60 schools, many are the remarkable Catholic schools that operate in the most poverty-stricken parts of Washington, DC. These schools are willing and able to provide true quality education to poor students; in fact the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington reports over 1,000 spaces are available in its 16 Washington schools. 
They want to do the job, Mr. President. But first, Congress must stand up to the teachers' unions and the rest of the public school establishment that doesn't want to answer for the poor performance of public schools. The Coats/Lieberman amendment is a day of reckoning for the failure of the D.C. public school system--and an outstanding way for Congress to help school children receive the education they deserve.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have at hand an impressive article detailing the oppression that the people of Cuba have long suffered, and still suffer to this day. It was written by Carrol Fisher of Salisbury, NC, and I decided that it should be made available to all Senators--and to others who are concerned about the dictatorship 90 miles off our shores. 
Carrol Fisher is a World War II Navy veteran whose first visit to Cuba was in 1944. He fell in love with the island and its people, including the young lady who became his wife 40 years ago. He and Mrs. Fisher [Sonia] returned to Cuba recently to visit his seriously ill sister-in-law. During that visit, he observed the degrading state of affairs in Cuba, the results of Castro's oppressive military government. 
When he returned to Salisbury, Mr. Fisher wrote a detailed account of what he had witnessed in Cuba. The article, published in the Salisbury (NC) Post, counsels that the United States under no circumstances should yield in its opposition to Fidel Castro's brutal regime.

Mr. HELMS. I certainly appreciate it. I would have been here earlier but we had a meeting on China in the Foreign Relations Committee. I couldn't leave. The witnesses were long-winded, as well as some others. 
But I compliment the distinguished Senator from Missouri. I have been in the same position that he has been in for several years. It is pretty lonely. But the people all across this country will admire the Senator from Missouri for it, and the Senator will hear from them--people who believe in high principles and morality. I just want the Senator to know that he is not being overlooked. 
I want a few minutes this afternoon to reflect upon an Associated Press report published Tuesday morning quoting NEA spokeswoman Cherie Simon as claiming that `legislative restrictions' and `internal reforms' have solved the NEA problem and that the NEA `didn't fund some of the programs as Helms condemned'. 
Mr. President, isn't it interesting? You have a little lady --and I know she is a nice lady because she is somebody's daughter, but I never heard of her--make this statement, which is not true in the first place, that the NEA is not furnishing taxpayers' money for a whole plethora of rotten material. No other word will fit. This dissembling has been going on, but every year they come up, and say, `Oh, no. Not us. We just fund nice things.' 
It is sort of like the farmer who heard some noise in his chicken house. He said, `Who is out there?' He heard a voice say, `Just us chickens.' And that is all the NEA says. I like Jane Alexander. I have met with her. But they are evading the issue every year. They are getting money that they ought not to get 
every year. 
If spokeswoman Cherie Simon, whoever she is, believes that `legislative restrictions,' as she put it, and `internal reforms,' as she put it, have, as she put it, `solved' the problem, she needs to wake up and smell the coffee because she obviously didn't understand the problem in the first place. The truth is that legislative restrictions and internal reforms mean simply that the NEA has been using subterfuge and sophistry to spend the taxpayers' money on programs that every year outrage the taxpayers. 
So the NEA wants to deny funding this filthy book, with all of their double talk about who is paying for it, or who has paid for it. This book, called `Blood of Mugwump' by a fellow named Doug Rice--the saints have been good to me; I have never heard of him before--the most filthy thing I believe I have ever read. And I have not read but about half a page of it. But down here it says--what do you guess? The National Endowment for the Arts. Up here it says that the National Endowment for the Arts is furnishing the money through the English Department for Contemporary Literature of Illinois State University, Illinois Arts Center. 
That is the way it always is--subterfuge about what is going on with the taxpayers' money. 
I am informed that while I was over in the Dirksen Building presiding in the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Harkin inserted a letter from the NEA disavowing NEA connection with the book. Yet, even the letter acknowledges that it was published by FC2. That is the publishing company, FC2. And FC2 put the NEA seal of approval on the copyright page of this book. All I am doing is reading it to you. 
The point, Mr. President, is this: The NEA and the FC2 can cook the books all they want to, but they know what this publishing company is all about, and they know about the filth that they have published, particularly in this book. There is not a Senator in this body who will take this book home and show it to his wife, or her husband, let alone their children. It is filth. And the taxpayers paid for it. No matter what Cherie Simon says about it, the taxpayers of America paid for this book. 
On June 24 of this year--long after the Senator from Iowa claimed that the NEA disavowed `Blood of Mugwump'--Jane Alexander wrote that FC2--get this--`FC2 has sustained a commitment to intellectual challenge. . .' That is the lady who heads the agency. That is the lady whom I like personally. She is a nice lady. But I don't know where she is when all of these decisions are made. This book sure is an intellectual challenge, isn't it?. I wish every citizen of America would take a look at it; they'd want to throw it in the furnace. 
Perhaps we should examine another example of how these legislative restrictions and internal reforms work. 
The other day on this floor I mentioned a grant--for fiscal year 1997--for a project by choreographer Mark Morris. This is the same guy who once staged a version of The Nutcracker Suite complete with cross-dressing and other unsavory themes. 
If the folks at the NEA want to say that the taxpayers didn't fund that piece of work, they might be accurate. But, knowing this fellow Morris and his background, the NEA will nevertheless--nevertheless--funnel $150,000 of the taxpayers' money this year to support his future work. 
That is what is going on. They come forth with obfuscation and confusion, Mr. President, and they hoodwink a lot of Senators. They didn't hoodwink them over in the House of Representatives. 
The amendment of the Senator from Missouri deserves to be approved on a unanimous vote. It won't be, because there are enough weak sisters sitting around that will find some excuse for not voting for it. 
But I commend the Senator, and I praise him for taking the time to address this subject. 
One final note. I think it is time to end the charade at the 
NEA and just acknowledge to the taxpayers once and for all that Congress will no longer waste money on this Federal agency. So the Senate of the United States ought to do the right thing today by adopting the amendment of the Senator from Missouri. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield back such time as I may have. 
Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending September 12, the United States imported 9,371,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,799,000 barrels more than the 7,572,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 59.6 percent of their needs last week, and there is no sign that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By U.S. producers using American workers? 
Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 9,371,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Madam President, Senator Ashcroft of Missouri is on an airplane at this moment, which I hope is approaching Washington. It has been delayed, but he will be here shortly to offer the amendment on which I desire to speak. 
I am honored to cosponsor this amendment, which would eliminate funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. Other Senators will voice their support, I believe, for the Ashcroft-Helms amendment; certainly the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], and the senior Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback]. In any case, I commend Senator Ashcroft's willingness to exercise strong leadership on this issue. We will proceed while looking forward to his arrival on the Senate floor. 
The other day, John Ashcroft and I were visiting on this subject, and we were reflecting upon the fact that more than 8 years have passed since an award-winning, blasphemous, and--how to put it--stomach-churning photograph of a crucifix soaked in urine alerted this Senate to the disgusting decision by the National Endowment for the Arts to reward the so-called artist who conceived the concept and submitted it for a grant with a substantial amount of the taxpayers' money. 
Along about the same time I came into possession of copies of the so-called, now well-known, Mapplethorpe artistry, which was a homosexual display. I recall bringing that to this floor. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia was sitting right over there, and another Senator was speaking. I don't remember which one. I asked Senator Byrd if he would consider an amendment to outlaw something that I thought was grievously blasphemous, and I thought that he might think so, too. I remember that I showed Senator Byrd the Mapplethorpe photos. I will say that he exclaimed very definitely that he found them repulsive. The bottom line is that he took my amendment and it was accepted on the legislation. That is when the hard feelings developed with certain people who favored not restraining the National Endowment for the Arts. 
During the 8 years that have elapsed since that evening that I came and spoke to Senator Byrd, the Senate has learned a very great deal about the way the National Endowment for the Arts conducts its affairs, and, thank the Lord, so have many millions of Americans found out about it across the land. They constitute 
loud voice to echo exactly what the House of Representatives did the month before last, I believe it was, in cutting off all funding, zeroing the National Endowment for the Arts. For one thing, it is self-evident that many of the beneficiaries of NEA grants are contemptuous of--how to say it--traditional moral standards. 
Now, we have stripped the phony veneer from the curiously elitist nature of those people who are self-selected arts experts. I run into them frequently. I hear from some in North Carolina, one in particular--he was born rich, never did a day's work in his life. He spends much of his time writing letters to me complaining about my not caring about the arts. Well, of course I do care about the arts. I have grandchildren who participate, and I think very well, in the arts. But they don't participate in the kind of things that I am talking about here today. 
We have stripped, as I say, the phony veneer from those people. Above all, we have learned the lengths that this crowd supporting the National Endowment for the Arts will go, and has been going, in order to preserve their access to millions of dollars of the taxpayers' money. 
I am going to get down to the nitty-gritty. It is going to offend some people here and there. Once the true nature of the National Endowment for the Arts became clear, more and more Senators have joined in supporting simple, commonsense measures to ensure that the NEA is operated in a reasonable manner. We have endeavored, sometimes successfully, sometimes not, to put an end to Federal grants, spending the taxpayers' money rewarding obscene or patently offensive work. We have worked to try to make sure that the NEA grants go to institutions rather than to individual artists. At every step, the arts establishment and its defenders in the left wing media--and in Congress, I might add--have vigorously opposed those reasonable reforms, often implying or downright declaring that anybody opposing such Federal grants is ignorant and indifferent to culture and art. 
There is a fellow in Massachusetts who used the words, phony baloney, the other day. I am going to borrow those two words from him and apply it to that kind of stand. I suppose this sort of opposition will continue just as long as the Congress allows the National Endowment for the Arts to cater to phony, self-appointed artists who insist on using the American taxpayers' money to finance anything they want to drag up from the sewer and declare to be art. 
But enough is surely enough. Millions of Americans have come to the conclusion that the National Endowment for the Arts is beyond salvation as a reasonable Federal agency. The amendment which the Senator from Missouri will a little later on send to the desk proposes to fund the NEA at a deserving level, exactly what it deserves--zero. To put it bluntly, I propose that none of the taxpayers' money be wasted by this agency anymore. 
I have done my best to work in good faith with administrators, past and present, of the National Endowment for the Arts. The present administrator, Jane Alexander, is a gracious lady. I like her personally, and I think she means well. But the problem persists: Despite all of the rhetoric, despite all the promises, the National Endowment for the Arts continues to underwrite projects that offend the sensibilities of millions of American taxpayers who resent the NEA's giving the taxpayers' money to self-styled artists whose art comes straight from the gutter and the sewer. 
So, this amendment that Senator Ashcroft and I will formally offer shortly keeps faith with the courageous decision of the House of Representatives to withhold funding from the National Endowment for the Arts during the House consideration of H.R. 2107, the Interior appropriations bill. The Senate, simply said, ought to do what is right and follow suit. 
Following that vote in the House of Representatives, the NEA's supporters did the usual thing. They trotted out their customary absurdities in describing an America without art, an America 
without culture unless the Senate restores full funding to the NEA. And they did that with violins being played and weeping voices. Baloney. Perhaps the Senate will default on its responsibilities, but it will have to do it after a number of Senators have made clear why the House action with reference to the NEA was entirely justified. 
Madam President, Americans watching and hearing this Senate session this afternoon on C-SPAN should be prepared, sooner or later, for another dose of the same old, tired rhetoric about how the survival of arts in America depends upon the NEA--when the truth of the matter is that American arts were thriving long before the agency received its first penny, its first appropriation, back in 1966, and the arts will continue to flourish and flower long after the NEA has disappeared from the radar screen. 
In any event, the American people may be forgiven for wondering precisely how do the powers-that-be at the National Endowment for the Arts define--define--American arts and culture. Let's do a little thinking about that. The agency's recent grant to the Whitney Museum may provide a useful clue. On July 15, 1997, the news program `Dateline' NBC reported that the NEA had given a grant of--now get this--$400,000 to the Whitney Museum. As NBC pointed out, the Whitney Museum is the beneficiary already of an unusually large private endowment. Yet the museum is nevertheless deemed by the NEA to be a worthy recipient for Federal taxpayers' dollars. 
What exactly is it about the Whitney Museum that makes it so worthy? 
Certainly, one must hope, not the 1997 biennial exhibition. 
The average taxpayer sitting in North Carolina or Idaho, or wherever, will never know anything about this unless the news media tells them or unless they are watching C-SPAN at this moment. But this year's biennial--and this is just an example --this year's biennial featured an exhibit that launched an attack on Santa Claus. The Kansas City Star newspaper reviewed the show and included this observation:  
The myth of Santa propounded by Disney and Hallmark is rendered all but unrecognizable by Paul McCarthy's video installation of a wildly perverted Santa's workshop. The main players, raunchy art-girl elves dressed in skimpy elf tunics and sticky-dirty with chocolate sauce, alternately devote themselves to creating confections and performing lewd acts with stuffed animals, one of them large and animate. 
Oh, boy, Madam President, if that is art, then the sewer is a swimming pool. In awarding the show's `booby prize' to Mr. McCarthy, the Wall Street Journal's Deborah Solomon wrote this: 
Reader, I can only hope you're not eating your breakfast when I tell you that his `Santa's Workshop' revolves around the theme of Christmas personalities doing weird things with excrement. 
Indeed. And I hope anyone listening to this debate in this audience this afternoon will inquire of the Senators from their States why they approve of a Federal agency that awards $400,000 of the taxpayers' money to the curators of a museum who countenance such an exhibit. 
Oh, I can hear it, Madam President. I have been hearing it for over 8 years. `Oh,' they say, `such grants of questionable taste are purely isolated incidents.' The trouble with that is that the evidence suggests otherwise, because last year, $150,000 of the NEA's funds went to a project by a choreographer named Mark Morris, and he is the very same Mark Morris who once staged a homosexual version of `The Nutcracker Suite,' called `The Hard Nut.' The taxpayer will be forgiven for wondering whether Mr. Morris' future work will deal with similar material. 
I believe we already heard all we want to hear about last year's $31,500 grant for the production of the film `Watermelon Woman,' to which two or three Senators have already alluded on this floor this afternoon. This film was made by and about lesbians and featured in the words of the reviewer `the hottest lesbian sex scene ever recorded on celluloid.' And this is one of the art projects that the National Endowment for the Arts, Madam President, said we must have in order to preserve art and culture in our society. 
Perhaps worst of all, however, is a travesty that emerged from a $25,000 grant to an organization called FC2, a bunch of weirdoes responsible for publishing, among other sickening things, Doug Rice's book entitled `Blood of Mugwump: A Tiresian Tale of Incest.' 
Oh, boy, what an artistic achievement that is. According to the back cover of the book, the plot, if you can call it a plot, describes `[a] member of a clan of Catholic, gender-shifting vampires [setting] out to discover himself in his sister's body.' 
Twenty-five thousand dollars of your money, Mr. and Mrs. America, goes so we can keep art flourishing in the United States. 
That is not the half of it, Madam President. Suffice it to say that our staff members were--and I am talking about the folks I work for in my office, the finest young people you ever saw--they were just about ready to throw up earlier today after they had glanced through this wretched book's description of incestuous sexual activity, paid for with the taxpayers' money, mind you. 
Whether all this garbage is metaphorical or literal or whatever, I don't know, I don't care, and I don't want to know. What I want to know is how long we are going to tolerate the National Endowment for the Arts continuing to fund this kind of garbage. I do know, and I have known this for a long time, and I have said it a thousand times on this floor--and maybe if I live long enough I will say it another thousand times: the American 
taxpayers should not be forced to pay for stuff like this. But if one opens this book to the copyright page, there it is: The seal of approval from and by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Let me say that again--and I like Jane Alexander, she is a nice lady--but she is not controlling that shop down there. I cannot believe that she is. Let me be clear. I am not calling for censorship. I come from the news business. I made my living that way for most of my life before I came here. But this is not censorship to say we are not going to pay for this kind of mess anymore. I say again what I have said many times, I don't have any problem with some guy going in the men's room and scrawling dirty words on the wall, provided he pays for his own crayons and provided he owns the men's room. Making the taxpayers pay for it is what I object to. 
This Doug Rice is entitled to write whatever he pleases. He may try to shock and offend whatever poor souls across America run across his foul literary pretense, but let me reiterate, again and again, the American taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize such sewage as this work. 
But you know, Madam President, many Americans believe--and I agree with them--that grants such as these are sufficient reason to end, once and for all, funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. I suspect that the American people would be even more resolute in their opposition to the NEA if they were aware of other practices of the NEA that bring the NEA's legitimacy into question. 
To begin with, the American public needs to know about the NEA's practice of carefully rewarding its supporters and past beneficiaries. For example, even the New York Times, liberal as it is, loving the NEA as it does, has reported that 85 percent of this year's recipients have previously fed at the NEA trough. 
How have they done it? I will tell you. The NEA does not consider the financial position of its applicants. That would step on some toes, you know. Instead, the NEA continues to hand out money to institutions that have a conspicuous lack of need--they don't need it--for being handed large sums of the taxpayers' money. 
Harvard University--now get this, Harvard, which has in its bank accounts an endowment of more than $6 billion--billion with a `b'--$6 billion; nevertheless, it was sent $150,000 by the National Endowment for the Arts. What for? I will quote it to you: 
To support augmentation of the Harvard University Art Museum's endowment. 
Doesn't that grab you? That just makes me tearful with joy. If you believe that, you will believe anything. 
Phillips Academy, one of the most prestigious boarding schools in the country, received $125,000 from the NEA this year. 
The University of California at Berkeley received $135,500. 
Princeton University, with its total endowment exceeding $2.6 billion that they have already gotten from private sources, nevertheless the good old NEA sent them $20,000 of taxpayers' money. Now, how do you like them apples? 
Yale University--I am not going to let them get off the hook--with a total endowment fund of $3.5 billion which it had gotten from private sources, received $100,000 from the NEA for the Yale Repertory Theater for--I want you to guess what for--a celebration of the 100th birthday of a Marxist playwright, Bertolt Brecht. 
Boy, I know the people in Shetland Switch will be delighted to hear that their money was sent there. That is exactly what we count on our Federal Government to do. 
Additional scrutiny of NEA grants provides countless examples of such financial judgment. For one example, bureaucracy being piled upon bureaucracy. How do they do it? Very simple. The NEA gives grants to the Federal Government itself. That is a neat trick, isn't it? For example, the Federal Facilities Council of the State Department--and I am going to speak to Madeleine Albright about this--will receive from the NEA up to $10,000--now stay with me--up to $10,000 `to support a partnership of Federal agencies convened to identify and advance technologies, processes and management practices that improve the planning, design, construction, operation, and evaluation of Federal facilities and enable more effective utilization of limited resources.' 
Madeleine, you better come home. 
Seriously, Madam President, what does all of this mean? For those of us not fluent in the language of bureaucrats, your guess would be as good as anybody's, but only in Washington would one Federal agency fund another Federal agency for a study on how to increase efficiency. 
Finally, there are the so-called planning and stabilization grants for which the NEA spent more than 10 million bucks this year. And what is the purpose of those grants? Mostly for giveaway gambits like the $125,000 grant to Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, Inc., in Lee, MA, which was given the money not because it needed the money, but they wanted to increase their cash reserve a little bit. 
Well, I expect there are some Senators around here who would like to have their cash reserves increased a little bit. 
This, to be serious about it, I say to Senators and ladies and gentlemen who may be listening, this is your tax money. 
And I want to ask you, How's your cash reserve? 
But let us be very clear about what the NEA is doing. It is putting your tax dollars--no questions asked--into the bank accounts of artists and institutions for which there is simply no precedent--no precedent--for these handouts. 
Even disadvantaged businesses that qualify for low-interest loans from the Government must pay back the money, but not these rich folks. If any of these struggling small businesspeople asked for a cash-direct handout from the Federal Government, they would be laughed off the premises and they would be recommended for a medical examination. 
Madam President, I am not going to belabor the subject anymore except for one closing observation. I say this with all seriousness. What does or does not constitute art is not decreed from on high by the National Endowment for the Arts. Art and culture--for better or worse--should remain in the hands of the American people, not bureaucrats. Continued funding of the NEA not only wastes the taxpayers' money on a small contingent of wealthy elitists, it also continues the arrogant assumption that a Government-funded arts establishment must--must--determine what art is fit for public consumption. 
I think there is no exaggeration involved in saying that this assumption is contrary to the Founding Fathers' notions of freedom and liberty on which I was taught as a little boy that this Nation was built. In fact, I think that if Jefferson and Franklin and all the rest came around here one of these afternoons, I suspect they would agree with millions of Americans who have so little regard for the entity known as the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as always, we are sometimes called on to be two places at one time with two or three committee meetings going on. I was recorded--and it was my fault. It was not the clerk's fault. It was my fault because I thought it was a tabling motion when it was not. In any case, on rollcall vote No. 234, I voted `yea,' and it was my intent to vote `nay.' 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to change my vote, which will in no way change the outcome of the vote.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as I offered this resolution just now regarding Hong Kong, it occurred to me that it is a coincidence that Hong Kong's Chief Executive, the Honorable C.H. Tung, is visiting in the United States this week. 
I confess the hope that he will get the message everywhere he goes on Capitol Hill, and everywhere else in Washington, that the provisional legislature's attacks on civil liberties, which Mr. Tung has defended, along with a new plan for an undemocratic legislature for Hong Kong, are totally unacceptable. 
Incidentally, Mr. President, I am grateful to the several cosponsors who are joining in the offering of this resolution: Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kerry of Massachusetts, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Mack of Florida. 
Last July 1, when Hong Kong was returned to China, in accordance with the terms of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, the joint declaration made absolutely clear that Hong Kong was to be autonomous and have an elected legislature, among many other things. 
But, Mr. President, in the past few weeks, new rules for Hong Kong elections have been prepared that clearly violate the joint declaration and threaten to cause irreparable damage to Hong Kong's autonomy. New rules being prepared by the provisional legislature--a body that itself is a violation of the joint declaration because it is unelected, and this provisional legislature, it will be remembered, is the body chosen last December in a process tightly controlled by Beijing. Though the people of Hong Kong had no say whatsoever, yet, it is this very provisional legislature that is writing the rules for Hong Kong's elections. 
Mr. President, this provisional legislature is now planning to adopt election rules for a new body comprising 40 totally undemocratic seats. Thirty of these seats will be `functional constituency' seats, as they have been described. The functional constituencies allow small numbers of trade, professional and other groups to choose a representative. In many cases, these functional constituencies are tiny--about 1,000 members. 
Britain introduced this system during its colonial rule, and it was a mistake. Britain's last governor, Chris Patten, attempted to improve upon the system by adding new, larger constituencies. Reportedly, even these broader functional constituencies will be slashed, drastically reduced in terms of the number of voters. The functional constituencies belong, as the Wall Street Journal stated, `on the ash heap of history.' Ten more seats will be chosen by an election committee comprised of pro-Beijing groups. 
Finally, the real motives of the provisional legislature can be discerned in their treatment of the 20 democratically elected seats. These seats will be chosen according to a proportional representation scheme expressly designed to reduce the number of prodemocracy candidates in the legislature. 
Mr. President, this is by no means inadvertent. It is deliberate. It is a deliberate attempt to reduce the influence of the most popular and ardently prodemocracy candidates and parties. 
The resolution just offered urges C. H. Tung and the Government of Hong Kong to schedule and conduct elections for the first legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region according to the rules approved by the Hong Kong people through an election law convention, referendum, or both. 
If the United States is to have a relationship with an autonomous Hong Kong, Hong Kong must have the democratically elected legislature it was promised--it was promised, Mr. President--in the joint declaration. The provisional legislature, which the United States has rejected as illegitimate and unjustified, is simply not intended to produce a legitimate electoral law. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I yield back such time as I may have.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, too many Americans have not the foggiest notion about the enormity of the Federal debt. Every so often, I ask various groups, how many millions of dollars are there in a trillion? They think about it, voice some estimates, most of them not even close. 
They are stunned when they learn the facts, such as the case today. To be exact, as of 10:08 a.m. today, September 5, 1997, the total Federal debt--down to the penny--stood at $5,414,792,993,913.96. 
Another astonishing statistic is that on a per capita basis, every man, woman, and child in America owes $20,203.80. 
As for how many millions of dollars there are in a trillion, there are a million in a trillion, which means that the Federal Government owes more than five million million dollars.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, another tragedy struck the people of Israel today. Three Palestinian suicide bombers attacked a crowded pedestrian mall in the center of Jerusalem. At least three Israelis were killed; many more were wounded. 
There was another bombing in the center of Jerusalem on July 30, in which 17 people were killed. Those murders were also claimed by the Palestinian terror group, Hamas. 
As in July, all the requisite people will issue the required condemnations, and comfort themselves that they have responded adequately. But how can we pretend that enough is being done about Palestinian terrorism? How can we look at pictures of Yasser Arafat embracing a terrorist on the front page of the New York Times and still maintain the fiction that this is a man committed to fighting terror? 
The answer, Mr. President, is simple: we cannot. 
Last month, in the wake of the most recent Jerusalem bombing, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she would travel to the Middle East if the PLO took the necessary steps to crack down on terrorists. Those steps clearly have not been taken. More innocent civilians lie bleeding in the streets. But the administration still clings to the fiction of a peace process. 
I have said many times, and I say again today: There is no peace in this process. How long will we be expected to play along with this charade, pretending that meetings, consultations, and formalities can substitute for genuine attempts to deliver peace and security to the people of Israel? 
In the coming months, the Congress will reconsider the provision of assistance to the Palestinians. At that time, we must ask ourselves whether the PLO has complied with its commitments, not only to Israel, but to the United States. We must ask ourselves whether Palestinian territories have become a beachead for terrorists. We must ask ourselves if the PLO and Yasser Arafat are partners worthy of the confidence of the United States. 
Mr. President, all we need do is look at the pictures on our television screens to see that the answer to each of those questions is no.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending August 29, the United States imported 8,513,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,786,000 barrels more than the 6,727,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 57.4 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By U.S. producers using American workers? 
Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 8,513,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, since 1920 there has been a Federal law on the books that, while perhaps well intentioned, nonetheless forbids a vast segment of the farming community in North Carolina and other States from obtaining reasonably-priced grain from the Midwest. It has long prevented Midwestern grain producers from delivering much needed grain to grain deficit states which experience difficulty in feeding their livestock. 
That is why I am today introducing S. 1138 which I have titled `The Freedom To Ship Act of 1997.' I am pleased to have Senator Brownback, Senator Burns, Senator Hagel, and Senator Roberts as original cosponsors. 
Mr. President, the Jones Act, as it is commonly called, prevents a large sector of the Agricultural community in North Carolina from obtaining grain from the Midwest at reasonable prices. Furthermore, it is preventing grain suppliers in the Midwest from supplying grain deficit states, such as North Carolina, with grain needed for their livestock. 
Under the present system, a few waterborne carriers have a monopoly on shipping, and my folks in North Carolina tell me that those shippers have no certified Jones Act ships to meet their demands. 
My poultry and pork farmers tell me they can't get enough grain for their farms to feed their animals. My State cannot, and will never be able, to produce enough grain for the poultry and pork producers in North Carolina; so, as a result, they must, I repeat, they must have grain shipped in from the Midwest. They tell me the railroads can't guarantee enough rail cars to get the supplies of grain needed from the Midwest. And the costs of these shipments that are available are very high. The increase in transportation costs coupled with the price of grain leads to higher overhead for my farmers. This shortage of grains and shortage of trains means higher costs and higher prices which threatens the jobs of many farmers. 
According to the 1996 North Carolina Department of Agriculture report, North Carolina was first in the nation in turkey production with 59.5 million heads; our State was number two in hog production, exceeded by Iowa, at 9.8 million heads; and in commercial broilers North Carolina was fourth with 681 million heads, exceeded by Arkansas, Georgia, and Alabama. 
While we slightly dropped off in turkey production in 1996, we increased hog 
production by 1.5 million head and increased commercial broiler production by 37 million heads over the last statistical reporting period. That is a tremendous number of poultry and livestock to feed, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. 
Dependence on one mode of transportation, the railroads, is not good. In times of severe weather, such as heavy snows in Winter and flooding from heavy rains, many times railroads can't get through mountain passes or flooded areas of the country. We've seen quite a few severe winters and floods in the past few years. Even a delay of one day can be critical to farmers. 
Mr. President, the problem is that the Jones Act restricts shipping between ports in the United States. It requires that merchandise being transported by water between U.S. points be shipped on U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-manned, and U.S.-citizen owned vessels that are documented by the Coast Guard for such carriage. The problem is that there are not enough Jones Act certified vessels to transport grain to North Carolina farmers. As a matter of fact, my farmers are now faced with being forced to go to foreign sources of feed grain. 
According to a report in the September 12, 1995, Journal of Commerce, Murphy Family Farms brought in a cargo of 1 million bushels of Canadian wheat to the port of Wilmington, North Carolina on Canada Steamship Lines. 
Mr. President, the Jones Act is not fair to grain producers in the Midwest. It penalizes them for being American farmers. 
Those that would protest this legislation would say that it would destroy American shipping. If we maintain the status quo, my farmers will have no choice but to buy foreign grain from countries like Canada and Argentina and it will be transported on non U.S. flagged vessels. 
Mr. President, this legislation requires any non-U.S. flag shipping company that wishes to do regularly scheduled business in the coastwise trades to: set up a United States Corporation, use U.S. Labor, comply with all state and federal law and--for those of us who are worried about the budget deficit--pay state and Federal Taxes. More importantly, it would create more long shore jobs. The more ships you have in the trade the more you have to load and unload, hence you need more workers. 
According to a report, issued in December of 1995, by the United States International Trade Commission, `The economy wide effect of removing the Jones Act is a U.S. economic welfare gain of approximately $2.8 billion. This figure can also be interpreted as the annual reduction in real national income imposed by the Jones Act. A primary reason for the large gain in welfare is a decline of approximately 26 percent in the price of shipping services formerly restricted by the Jones Act.' 
It is strange circumstance where we are the breadbasket of the world and there is a lid on the basket of the domestic market placed by the Jones Act. 
Mr. President, the Jones Act placing restrictions on shipments of a whole host of other non-agricultural goods and commodities, such as coal, fuel oil, steel, kaolin clay, in the United States. Our legislation would help lower shipping costs for many other industries as well. 
So I urge my colleagues to join us in correcting this inequity to allow American grain to be shipped unhindered to those grain deficit states that are in need of it; and all other non-agricultural commodities and goods to be shipped by water at reasonable costs where they are needed.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this morning, the Foreign Relations Committee approved and sent to the Senate an original resolution--Senate Concurrent Resolution 46--condemning the terrorist attack in Israel at 1:15 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, Israel time, when two terrorists entered a market in the center of Jerusalem and blew themselves up, killing at least 12 Israelis, and leaving 120 wounded, at least 20 of whom are described in critical condition. 
Mr. President, the reason for this attack was probably yesterday's announcement that the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians were about to resume. Clearly, the terrorists decided to try to derail the peace process by murdering innocent people. They perhaps have succeeded, because the peace process, Mr. President, is meaningless if there is no security for the people of Israel. 
It is reported that Yasser Arafat telephoned Prime Minister Netanyahu to apologize for the bombing. He has had ample practice in issuing apologies and regrets for Palestinian attacks on Jews. But rhetoric is cheap. The question all of us must ask is: `Has Yasser Arafat done what it takes to rid the territories under his control of terrorists?' The answer to that is obvious: no. 
The United States has done a great deal, too much, some contend, to support the Palestinian Authority. What has the Authority done to crack down on terror? Not nearly enough. Palestinian police officials are implicated in murders; terrorists are operating freely in areas under the Palestinian Authority's control. 
Now dozens of innocent people lie dead and wounded. Not soldiers. Not military or police personnel. Just innocent people--mothers, fathers, children. There is no peace in this process.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, partisan politics, I guess, is a game like football, baseball, or checkers, and that game has, no doubt, been played in the Senate for as long as there has been a Senate. In it, you win some, you lose some, and, as the saying goes, some are rained out. It has been suggested from time to time that maybe a time or two I have played a little bit of it myself, and I plead nolo contendere to the suggestion. 
But the game, it seems to me, that the distinguished minority leader, Mr. Daschle, has been playing of late has sometimes been marked by a rather interesting degree of misstatements of fact--unintentional, I'm sure--and curious conclusions. That, too, has not been unknown heretofore in the history of the Senate. And I do not suggest that the minority leader's misstatements or insinuations are deliberate, and I am willing to assume that his errors are accidental and unintentional. 
Just the same, my observations this afternoon are based on my incredulous reaction early this morning when I read an article in the Washington Post, page A21, under a headline reading `Confirmation Process Frustrates President.' That was, of course, Mr. Clinton, with whom Senator Daschle says he met this past Wednesday night. It indicates that Senator Daschle confided to the Washington Post's very competent reporter, Helen Dewar, that--and I quote from Ms. Dewar's story--`The President . . . expressed probably the highest level of exasperation I've heard him express on the subject, Daschle said, making clear that he (Senator Daschle) shares Clinton's frustration.' 
Further, according to Ms. Dewar's report, `[Senator] Daschle estimated that there are 30 ambassadorial nominations awaiting action for countries that, according to a Senate list, include Britain, France, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Bosnia, and, as of Tuesday, Mexico.' 
Well, Mr. President, if Mr. Clinton and Mr. Daschle are suffering their `highest levels of exasperation,' and if the President uttered the `choice words' attributed to him by Senator Daschle regarding the work of the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, then I suggest that both gentlemen dismount their high horses, examine the true facts, and correct their joint misstatements about the excellent work of the Foreign Relations Committee, which I have the honor of serving as chairman, with Senator Joe Biden as the ranking member. 
What the President is purported to have implied--and Mr. Daschle says he agrees with it--is nonsense, I say respectfully; it is nonsense regarding the work and cooperation of the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which Adm. `Bud' Nance is the Chief of Staff. Bud Nance is among the top chiefs of staff ever to serve the Senate's committees, and I believe Mr. Clinton's State Department will join me in that assessment of the committee staff members, both majority and minority. 
Now, let's look at some specific things and respond to the President with what the actual facts are. 
First, Thomas Pickering left the position of Ambassador to Russia on November 1, 1996. The Foreign Relations Committee received the nomination of James Collins to succeed Tom Pickering 7 months later, on June 2, 1997. Let me just remind anybody who may be interested that Russia is selling sophisticated weaponry to terrorist states, such as Iran, and Russia barely maintains control of its 20,000 warhead nuclear arsenal. Now, by Mr. Clinton's own choice, the position of Ambassador to Russia went vacant for 7 months. We didn't get a piece of paper from the White House. When we did get the nomination, we expedited the hearing process for this nomination, and we are prepared to send it to the full Senate--that is, the nomination of James Collins --next week. 
Second, Charles Redman left the position of Ambassador to Germany on June 20, 1996, over a year ago. The Foreign Relations Committee received the nomination of John Kornblum for this position on May 22 of this year, 1997. Now, Mr. President, Germany is the most powerful country in Europe and is central to virtually every decision made by our European allies. By the White House's own choice, don't you see, the position of Ambassador to Germany was vacant for almost a full year. The committee scheduled a hearing after finally getting the papers on the nomination of Mr. Kornblum, and we are prepared to send the nomination to the Senate next week. 
Third, John Menzies left the position of Ambassador to Bosnia in December 1996. The Foreign Relations Committee received the nomination of Richard Kauzlarich on July 8, 1997, just a couple of weeks ago. Now, it was the White House's choice that the position of Ambassador to Bosnia was vacant for more than 8 months before we got a scrap of paper from the White House in the Foreign Relations Committee. Of course, thousands of 
American soldiers have been kept in Bosnia for 8 months, but for 8 months the White House has delayed sending the nomination of the successor, Mr. Kauzlarich. The committee, again, has scheduled a hearing to consider this nomination. We are prepared to send it to the Senate next week. 
Fourth, James Blanchard left the position of Ambassador to Canada in April 1996, over a year ago. The Foreign Relations Committee received the nomination of Gordon Griffin on June 26, 1997. The Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on July 15, after we had gotten all of the papers prepared, and reported his nomination to the full Senate on July 17, where it is pending on the Executive Calendar of the Senate. The United States is engaged in foreign policy and trade disputes with Canada, ranging from the Pacific Northwest to Cuba, and the position to Ambassador to Canada was vacant--not the responsibility of the Foreign Relations Committee, but of the White House--the White House--for more than a year. 
Fifth, the post of United States Ambassador to France has been vacant since the death of Ambassador Pamela Harriman. She died on February 5 of this year. And then, after that, there was a month-long public battle between several of President Clinton's political supporters and a career Foreign Service officer who wanted the post, and the President finally selected one of the substantial donors to the Democratic Party for this position. Now, that is not unusual. The point is that all this time elapsed. It was not the Foreign Relations Committee staff's fault. It was the White House's fault. Mr. Daschle is bound to have known that. 
Let me say that the French leaders have opposed the United States on almost every foreign policy decision regarding United States-European relations, but by President Clinton's choice, the position of Ambassador to France, nevertheless, was vacant for just about 6 months. 
The committee again has scheduled a hearing to consider the nomination next Tuesday, less than a week after the papers got up to us from the White House. So who is delaying all of these nominations, Mr. President? I think the facts speak for themselves. 
Then there is the nomination of Philip Lader. I believe it came on July 22, just a few days ago. The committee has immediately scheduled a hearing for Mr. Lader for next Tuesday, less than a week after receiving this nomination. 
Seventh, the President has yet to name ambassadors for Japan and South Korea. Now, these Embassies have been minus ambassadors since the end of last year, nearly 8 months--not the fault of the Foreign Relations Committee, not the fault of the Senate, not the fault of anybody in the Senate, but the White House. 
Let me reiterate and emphasize that there has been a high degree of cooperation between the State Department and the Senators who serve on the Foreign Relations Committee and, I might add, between the excellent staff of the committee and the State Department staff. I think that the cooperation between the various entities has been remarkable and unheard of for several years prior to this year and last year. In fact, we have done our best to work with and consult with the White House. 
Therefore, statements made by Senator Daschle are not acceptable. To the extent that the President has stated or has implied that any lag in the ambassadorial nomination process is the fault of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have to say, no, sir; you are wrong. 
Some time back the White House publicly identified a possible--a possible--nomination about which I had and still have a problem. I have tried to be as candid and up front about my position regarding that nomination since long before the nomination was made. When? Just this past week.

Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. 
The concurrent resolution was agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 43) follows: 
S. Con. Res. 43 
Whereas the North American Free Trade Agreement (in this resolution, referred to as `the NAFTA') was intended to reduce trade barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States; 
Whereas the NAFTA represented an opportunity for corn farmers and refiners to increase exports of highly competitive United States corn and corn products; 
Whereas corn is the number one U.S. cash crop with a value of $25,000,000,000; 
Whereas U.S. corn refiners are highly efficient, provide over 10,000 non-farm jobs, and add over $2,000,000 of value to the U.S. corn crop; 
Whereas the Government of Mexico has initiated an antidumping investigation into imports of high fructose corn syrup from the United States which may violate the antidumping standards of the World Trade Organization; 
Whereas on June 25, 1997, the Government of Mexico published a Preliminary Determination imposing very high antidumping duties on imports of United States high fructose corn syrup; 
Whereas there has been concern that Mexico's initiation of the antidumping investigation was motivated by political pressure from the Mexican sugar industry rather than the merits of Mexico's antidumping law: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending July 18, the United States imported 8,145,000 barrels of oil each day, 360,000 barrels more than the 7,785,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 56.3 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By U.S. producers using American workers? 
Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 8,145,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending July 11, the U.S. imported 7,678,000 barrels of oil each day, 409,000 barrels more than the 7,269,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 54.9 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By U.S. producers using American workers? 
Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 7,678,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this amendment will help address the critical educational needs of the children of the fine soldiers and airmen serving at Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina. 
Across America, many communities surrounding major military installations are at a great disadvantage by having large numbers of military-connected schoolchildren, yet they receive nowhere near adequate impact aid. Harnett County in North Carolina is one of them. Harnett County is a relatively rural, agricultural county; that has experienced tremendous growth in its military-connected student population during the last decade. 
Many soldiers stationed at Fort Bragg, and airmen assigned to Pope Air Force Base, have found a home in Harnett County because of its peaceful quality of life, its proximity to the bases and many other desirable aspects. According to one housing developer, 98 percent of the families buying in his community are military families. Harnett County has welcomed these newcomers but, in so doing, has struggled for the past several years to provide the basic services required to accommodate this burgeoning population. 
Mr. President, Harnett County's schools have been especially impacted by this influx of military dependents. Recent years have seen thousands of students added to the rolls of Harnett County's school system. This growth has resulted in severe overcrowding in Harnett County schools. Many children have been forced to attend classes in temporary facilities, such as cafeterias, gymnasiums, auditorium stages, libraries, and trailers. In some schools, students must wait in line up to an hour even to use the bathroom. 
Mr. President, projections indicate that Harnett County taxpayers will have to spend $87,000,000 for new schools within the next decade merely to keep up with this growth. As a rural county, Harnett has little industry or commercial development that can be used to generate significant tax dollars for school construction. The county simply does not have nearly enough resources to build more schools to serve these military dependents without substantial assistance. 
The Federal Government has an obvious obligation to provide for the education of military dependents. Because of the nature of military service which requires frequent moves and reassignments, military families seldom have an opportunity to establish strong roots in a community or to become active in local schools. The Federal Government has a duty to ensure that these parents, who are prepared to risk their lives and go to war in 18 hours to serve our country, need not worry about the quality of education afforded their children. 
For almost 50 years, Federal law has addressed the costs incurred by local communities in the education of military dependents through the payment of impact aid. These payments are designed to alleviate local government's inability to raise revenue for schools in the customary manner of raising property taxes since they are constitutionally prohibited from taxing installation property. These payments are not intended to benefit the local governments, but are intended to insure that service-members' children are not treated as second-class citizens and thereby disadvantaged by their parents' devotion to their country. 
Nevertheless, the responsibility for making these payments has been removed from the Department of Defense and placed upon the Department of Education over the years. In so doing, the Federal Government has steadily reduced its payments to local educational agencies that serve these children. Despite rhetoric in support of education to the contrary, the President's own budget punishes these children by proposing a reduction of $72 million or 10 percent below the fiscal year 1997 level. I have always believed that the Federal Government has a limited role in education, but clearly, it has a role when its actions place a direct negative economic impact upon a community, such as Harnett County. 
Some may argue that we owe no obligation to communities surrounding military bases. They may say that because communities now compete to retain military bases that our duties are mitigated. Our duty is owed to the service member, not the community. Besides, every community surrounding a military installation does not share equally in the economic benefit of having the installation closeby. For example, Harnett is the only county in the Fort Bragg impact area that suffers an economic loss due to its being adjacent to Fort Bragg. According to the latest statistics, Harnett County loses at least $122,000 per year because of Fort Bragg. 
Adding to the education funding crisis, Fort Bragg purchased an additional 7,000 acres in the county last year. That purchase nearly doubled the amount of land the Federal Government owns in Harnett. This purchase caused Harnett County to permanently lose an additional $24,000 in annual tax revenues. The projected fiscal year 1997 impact aid payment to Harnett County is only $37,712. Compare that to the $278,177 that the county would receive if impact aid basic support payments were fully funded. 
During the past few years, I have worked closely with concerned Harnett County leaders, including the school board and county commissioners, Army officials at Fort Bragg and here at the Pentagon, literally spending hundreds of hours working to try to address these critical Army needs. If I may quote from a March 9, 1995, letter by then Fort Bragg commanding general, Lt. Gen. Henry Shelton to Secretary of the Army Togo West: 
I sympathize with counties that have to educate our children, especially those, like Harnett County, that have recently experienced a substantial increase in the number of students from military families. I am concerned that the U.S. Department of Education is providing less impact aid for some military family members than for others, and that this disparity in impact aid might adversely affect the quality of education that some of our military family members are receiving. We should be providing the same high level of assistance for every child. Education is a key component of quality of life. For this reason, we should make every effort to ensure that all of our military family members receive a quality education regardless of where they live. 
General Shelton, of whom I am extremely proud, is now a four-star general in charge of the military's special operations command, went on to say to Secretary West `[my staff] offered to assist Harnett County * * * [and] discussed the possibility of conveying to Harnett County parcels of land for the construction of schools.'

Mr. HELMS. The map shows that neither of these small parcels of land is contiguous to the primary training areas at Fort Bragg--known as the Northern Training Area and Overhills property; they are also noncontiguous to each other. These properties are open farmland, surrounded by private property, without the foliage and terrain that Army units stationed at Fort Bragg require for operational training. 
Mr. President, local leaders and Army officials had planned for the Army to provide a long-term lease for the construction of three schools--an elementary school, a junior high school, and a high school on land lying along N.C. 87 which crosses the recently acquired Overhills property. Over the last several months, they mutually agreed to forego that arrangement because of concerns that placement of schools in that area would impose restrictions on training and negatively impact the habitat of the red-cockaded woodpecker. Together, they agreed that the ideal location for these new schools was on the open tracts the Army had previously identified as being available for conveyance to the county. 
Last year, North Carolina voters approved a bond referendum for the construction of new schools. I am told that to use those funds, the county must own the land. Therefore, a long-term lease by the Army on these parcels would not be useful to the county or the Army. It is critical that parcel No. 404-2 be transferred now since Harnett County plans to break ground on construction later this year in an attempt to finally catch-up with the increasing demand for education imposed by the children of military personnel. This amendment further authorizes the Secretary of the Army to sell parcel No. 404-1 at fair market value. 
Mr. President, North Carolinians are proud of the several great military installations within our borders. For more than 50 years, North Carolinians have been especially proud of Fort Bragg, home of the U.S. Army's elite XVIII Airborne Corps, the 82d Airborne Division, and our Special Operations Forces. These units and other units stationed at Fort Bragg are on the front line of our Nation's defense; standing ready to deploy anywhere, any time, to preserve freedom in the world. 
Just 2 days ago, we were reminded once again about the price of liberty. Eight soldiers at Fort Bragg were tragically lost when their Blackhawk helicopter crashed. The victims have been identified and their families notified but the cause of the crash is still being investigated. 
Those who have served in the military understand the sense of family and community that exists among those, particularly those who have volunteered to put themselves in harm's way, for the benefit of their fellow-citizens. These courageous and selfless Americans use the instruments of war to secure our peace and prosperity. Each of these brave Americans experiences a feeling of loss when one of their own is lost. The North Carolinians who live around Fort Bragg share that sense of loss. Those citizens and the Fort Bragg family have embraced the families of the lost soldiers and are doing all they can to comfort them at this tragic time. 
I spent four nonheroic years in the Navy during World War II. I have always had great affection and respect for the soldiers and defense support personnel who devote their lives to the defense of our country. I will do anything in my power to ensure that they are provided everything they need to do their jobs. 
This includes not merely providing an adequate training area, equipment and hardware; but also the quality of life and peace of mind to enable each soldier to focus on his mission, accomplish it, and return home safely. Unmistakably essential to that quality of life is the proper education of their children. 
Listen again to the words of General Shelton, `[e]ducation is a key component of quality of life. For this reason, we should make every effort to ensure that all of our military family members receive a quality education regardless of where they live.' 
Mr. President, a vote against this amendment is a vote against the Army's senior civilian and military leaders charged with responsibility for the readiness and well-being of these fine men and women at Fort Bragg. 
A vote against this amendment is a vote against their children who depend upon us to help educate them so that they too can serve their country when they grow to adulthood. 
Mr. President, I do hope Senators will support this amendment which takes a small step toward addressing the educational needs of the children of our Nation's finest soldiers. It's the right thing to do and I am confident that Senators will agree.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, when the Pilgrims boarded the Mayflower and set sail for a new world, they were searching for a land where they would be free to worship God as they wished. Our Founding Fathers, inspired by their example, incorporated the principle of religious freedom into our national fabric. The importance of this principle to our national character is emphasized by its honored place in the first clause of our Bill of Rights which reads `Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' 
In spite of this protection, some citizens have, at times, sought to deny others the right to worship. In extreme cases, this intolerance has turned to violence as houses of worship were desecrated by fire or vandalism. Last month, the National Church Arson Task Force released a report that found no evidence of a nationwide conspiracy behind the fires. I never believed there was a conspiracy but that finding does not diminish the suffering of the congregations in my home State and across the United States who have been victimized in these incidents. 
Let there be no doubt, Mr. President, no act is more despicable than the desecration of a house of worship. It is fitting that the perpetrators of such a heinous crime be apprehended and prosecuted to the full extent of the law, I commend the Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials who work diligently to investigate these shameless acts and to prevent their recurrence. 
Mr. President, while stories of church burnings are no longer on the front page of every newspaper or the lead story on the evening news, the victims remain. The pastor of one of those congregations, Pastor Brenda Stevenson of the New Outreach Christian Center in Charlotte, which was destroyed by an arsonist in 1995, recently wrote me about her church's effort to rebuild. She informed me that her congregation was able to rebuild with the help of the Christian Coalition's Samaritan project and the Save the Churches fund but that further help was needed. Specifically, Pastor Stevenson requested that excess religious property, formerly used in closed military chapels, be made available to churches that have suffered these terrible acts. 
I am told that precisely such property has been found at Fort Bragg, NC, where several old wooden chapels were closed as part of a consolidation. The approximately $25,000 worth of property, including 65 oak pews, 3 altars, 2 pulpits, communion sets, and other religious property, has been declared excess to the needs of Fort Bragg and would ordinarily be sold at auction to the highest bidder. Similar property may also be available at other Army installations. 
I agree with Pastor Stevenson that the Army should be allowed to donate this surplus property to some of the churches damaged or destroyed as a result of arson or terrorism. The amendment I am introducing gives the Secretary of the Army authority to donate such property as it becomes available at Army installations. 
Mr. President, I know this matter may seem of little consequence to some considering that Congress is considering a budget in excess of $1.7 trillion dollars. However, the gift of this furniture and religious property can mean a very great deal to congregations such as the New Outreach Christian Center that are struggling to rebuild. 
Moreover, it is appropriate that Fort Bragg, home of the XVIII Airborne Corps, 82d Airborne Division, and special operations force, which have done so much to protect our liberties abroad, be permitted to contribute to the defense of those liberties at home. I invite my colleagues to join in support of this bill so that some small measure of relief can be provided to these victims.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, North Carolina lost a very special, very valuable and very distinguished leader this past April. He was known affectionately and respectfully across our State, and far beyond in every direction, simply as Mel Broughton. His full name was J. Melville Broughton, Jr., but you seldom heard all of that name. 
Mel Broughton, by all measurements, was one of those nature's noblemen who comes along only once in a while. Though his family was one of North Carolina's most distinguished, Mel Broughton was one of the least pretentious men I have ever known. 
His grandfather was North Carolina's Governor during the World War II years, 1941 to 1944. And in November 1948, former Governor Broughton was elected to the U.S. Senate. But fate was to allow Senator Broughton to serve in the U.S. Senate only a few months, because he had been sworn in as a Senator shortly after his having been elected in November 1948 but he died of a heart attack the following March. 
Incidentally, Mr. President, misfortune hovered over North Carolina throughout the 10-year period between the late 1940's and the following 10 years. Our State had a succession of 10 U.S. Senators during that decade. Five of them died in office; three were defeated in their reelection bids; and the two 
surviving Senators of that decade were Sam J. Ervin, Jr. and B. Everett Jordan. Senator Ervin served 20 years; Senator Jordan served 17. 
But let me return, Mr. President, to Mel Broughton, Jr., who was honored by North Carolina's general assembly on June 26 of this year when both Houses of our State legislature adopted `A joint resolution honoring the life and memory of J. Melville Broughton, Jr.' 
As that resolution states, Mel Broughton was devoted to North Carolina and to the people of our State. And he served in countless ways. Only once did he venture into Federal service, and that was when President Ford nominated him to serve on the board of directors of the U.S. Legal Services Corporation. And during those years, one of his colleagues on the Legal Services Corporation board was a young lady who today is the First Lady of America, Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
Mr. President, needless to say, Dot Helms and I have long been devoted to the Mel Broughton family. As a matter of fact, Mel's parents, Governor and Mrs. Broughton, were very dear to us and thoughtful to us in so many ways. 
And last, but certainly not least, I am privileged that Mel Broughton's son--one of them--whom all of us call Jimmy, is administrative assistant and thereby leader of the Helms Senate family. I do not have a staff. The fine, dedicated people in our offices are truly a family.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this amendment corrects a serious problem Congress created in 1987 when the definition for `essential government functions' was inadvertently changed relating to native American tribes, thereby inhibiting the tribes' use of tax-exempt bonds. Prior to 1987, the Cherokee Tribe and other tribes used tax-exempt bonds to finance `essential government functions.' In 1986, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, in western North Carolina, used this provision to purchase the Carolina Mirror Co. to ensure the Cherokee Tribe's long-term economic development. The Cherokees worked hard and built Carolina Mirror into the largest producer of mirrors in the United States. 
Then, Congress changed the rules in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, and narrowed the definition of `essential government functions', and today Carolina Mirror is in default and may be forced to close its Texas operation because of a staggering monthly obligation of $300,000. This amendment would allow these hard-working native Americans to refinance their current bonds at more competitive rates. The Joint Committee on Taxation asserts that this purely technical amendment will have a `negligible effect on the Federal fiscal year budget receipts.'

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we have taken on the air of a Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera here tonight and all this week. I heard on the radio, I say to my colleague from North Carolina, on the early morning news, several days ago, I heard a Senator say, `Yes, we are going to give umpteen hundred million dollars to children'--he didn't say children, he said `chillin,' and, oh, how benevolent he was--`because we are going to raise the cigarette tax,' we are going to sock the tobacco companies. Well, he is not going to do any such thing. But that is what he wants the folks back home to think. 
Speaker after speaker has pointed out that you are not taxing the tobacco companies; you are taxing the lower income people of this population of the United States. If you don't believe it, look at the record. Yet, they say, we are socking it to the tobacco companies--the evil tobacco companies--and they have all sorts of statistics that they pulled out of their hip pocket, saying how many lives it is going to save. They are not going to save any lives. 
The point is, I say to my friend from Kentucky, it is so much hot air. They know it is hot air, but they have nothing else to say. And they want a headline back home that Senator Joe Blow really socked it to the tobacco companies. No, Joe Blow is not socking it to the tobacco companies. 
He is socking it to the low-income people of this country who do something that maybe Joe Blow doesn't do--enjoy cigarettes. I don't smoke. Nobody in my family does. But I will tell you one thing. When you get down to it, it's a matter of choice and statistics--and you can play all sorts of games with statistics. But Lauch Faircloth has it right and so does the distinguished Senator from Kentucky. Both of them have it right about how many jobs this is going to adversely affect. 
This is the game we play. Go ahead and play it if you think you can win. I hope you can. But get you a little monkey and one of these organ grinders and sing this debate that you are making about tobacco, then you can be really funny. 
I thank the Senator. I yield such time as I may have.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in 1993, Stanly Memorial Hospital in Albermarle, NC, was reclassified as a rural instead of an urban hospital, resulting in a loss of $1.3 million each year in Medicare reimbursement. 
Stanly County is the only county in North Carolina, and, I believe, in the Nation, that is touched by four different urban counties and two different Metropolitan Statistical Areas. SMH's primary competitors are in the adjacent large urban MSA's which include Davidson, Rowan, Cabarrus, and Union Counties. 
By a purely bureaucratic decision, Stanley Memorial has been put in a position of having to compete with all of the Charlotte hospitals in recruitment of employees, managed care contracts, and doctors. 
But since Stanly Memorial is not included in the Charlotte MSA, it receives 20 percent less for the very same Medicare services as delivered by competing hospitals in surrounding areas. 
This amendment will correct this inequity by deeming Stanly County as part of the large urban area of Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, NC/SC.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending June 20, the U.S. imported 7,630,000 barrels of oil each day, 301,000 barrels fewer than the 7,931,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
While this is one of the very few weeks that Americans imported less oil than the same week a year ago, Americans relied on foreign oil for 54.4 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By U.S. producers using American workers? 
Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S: now 7,630,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today the House in effect approved President Clinton's renewal of most-favored-nation status for the People's Republic of China. The House failed to adopt a resolution disapproving of Mr. Clinton's renewal of MFN for China. 
The House thus squandered its opportunity to send a strong signal to the Clinton administration that its policy of engagement with China has not worked. 
The administration, and others supporting MFN, insisted that they were willing to pressure China on human rights, on trade, on proliferation, and on Hong Kong. They just didn't believe, they insisted repeatedly, that MFN is the way to do it. 
Fair enough, Mr. President. Taking supporters of MFN at their word, I hope Senators will make clear that if MFN isn't the proper tool to use in trying to influence China on such matters, what is the proper tool? By renewing MFN, President Clinton and supporters of MFN for China, have taken on a new burden--to show they are serious about finding a way to persuade China to stop abusing its citizens rights, stop unfair trade practices, stop sending weapons of mass destruction to rogue regimes, and live up to its commitments on Hong Kong. 
The debate over China policy is far from over. During the coming weeks and months, I will be considering new measures on China. 
For example, Mr. President, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold hearings on legislation to deal with serious problems in the United States-China relationship, and on the commercial activities of the People's Liberation Army in the United States. 
I do hope that Senators who have asserted that there is a better way to influence China than revoking MFN will work with the Foreign Relations Committee in finding that better way.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on July 31, 1995, Senator Dole and I introduced S. 1098, the Battle of Midway Memorial Act. Today I am proud to offer an updated version of S. 1098 on behalf of the majority leader, Mr. Lott, the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski. 
This bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to study the feasibility and advisability of establishing Midway Atoll as a national memorial to the Battle of Midway. It goes without saying that the sponsors of this bill strongly believe that this should be done without delay. I am confident that the Interior Secretary will agree. 
Mr. President, it was on June 4, 1942, that courageous American sailors, soldiers, and airmen stationed on Midway Atoll, and aboard 29 warships, clashed with 350 warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy in what became known as the Battle of Midway. When the smoke cleared, the small American force, under the overall command of Admiral Nimitz, had soundly defeated the Imperial Japanese Navy in one of the most spectacular and historically significant naval battles of all time, and a turning point in the Pacific theater in World War II. 
There is no reason to delay further the establishment of Midway Atoll as a national memorial to honor the American heros who fought and died there in defense of our liberties. Approval of this bill will be the first step in recognizing what those gallant Americans did in 1942--and that recognition is in fact long overdue. 
Mr. President, on April 25, 1996, the Energy Committee's Subcommittee on Parks, Historic Preservation, and Recreation held an extensive hearing on S. 1098, the predecessor to the bill we introduce today. Chairman Nighthorse Campbell received testimony from my treasured friend, Adm. Tom Moorer, who in my judgment, was the greatest Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ever to serve in that post--and a veteran of the Pacific theater of World War II, and Dr. James D'Angelo, president of the International Midway Memorial Foundation. 
If the committee chooses to have another hearing on this issue, I hope Chairman Murkowski and Chairman Nighthorse Campbell will ask whether any historic structures on Midway Atoll have been destroyed, and if so, why. If this has occurred, I will support modifying the bill to prohibit explicitly any further destruction of any historic structure on Midway Atoll. 
Mr. President, Adm. James W. (Bud) Nance, chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee, Esther Kia'aina of Sen. Akaka's staff, and Jim O'Toole with the Energy and Natural Resources Committee deserve special thanks. When Midway Atoll becomes a national memorial, it will in large part be due to their tireless efforts.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Armed Services Committee has filed the DOD authorization bill. It is the leader's intention to ask consent to turn to that bill at 12 noon on Wednesday. It is the leader's hope that Senators will grant the consent so the Senate can begin debate on this very important piece of legislation. Also, the Senate may be asked to consider the intelligence authorization bill. Therefore, votes can be expected to occur throughout the session of the Senate on Wednesday. 
The leader would remind Senators that we have a lot of work to do between now and the Fourth of July recess. Therefore, all Senators' cooperation is essential in order to complete our business in a responsible fashion.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his amendment and I, of course, share his concern with the increasing number of United Nations treaties that impose regulatory burdens and, as he puts it, infringe on the rights of the American people. In fact, the pending bill, S. 903, addresses many of his concerns. I demanded that this legislation prohibit any funding to the United Nations until the Secretary of State certifies that the sovereignty of the United States has not been violated. 
A lot of people giggled about that. But as the Senator knows, it is a very real problem, potentially. As the Senator also knows, many of us have worked for months to develop this comprehensive United Nations reform package. I think the Senator will understand, and I find myself in a position where I simply must be faithful to the deal into which I have made entry and participated. Senator Biden has been so cooperative. He is sticking to his bargain and I shall stick to mine. This bill requires a number of key reforms at the United Nations, but it certainly does not require every reform that I wanted. 
Let me say again to the Senator from Wyoming, I support his efforts but I cannot support any amendment to change this package. But I will assure him that the Foreign Relations Committee this week will have hearings to consider United Nations climate change negotiations, and will hold additional hearings on actions by the United Nations that impose international regulatory burdens on the American people.

Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. Let me make a few comments before we consider regular order. 
On February 8 of last year, 1996, I sent a letter to President Clinton urging that he no longer tolerate Chinese-Iranian missile cooperation and transfers. At that time I noted that U.S. nonproliferation laws provided `a clear, legal requirement--and I am quoting from my letter--that sanctions be levied against China for its missile sales to Iran,' and I appealed to the President at that time to act decisively. In response, the President assured me that he would, in fact, and in deed, implement the missile sanctions law, and he used the words, `faithfully and fully' when the United States had determined that sanctionable activities have occurred. 
Senator Bennett and I were speaking about that a while ago. We have been waiting for more than a year. Meanwhile, repeated media reports have confirmed beyond any peradventure whatsoever that Chinese-Iranian missile cooperation continues apace, and that the United States is well aware of these activities and that the administration has deliberately elected to ignore Sections 73 and 81 of the Arms Export Control Act, and the 1992 Iran-Iraq nonproliferation act. 
In fact, an article in the Washington Times last November 21, I believe it was, purports to quote from a classified October 2, 1996 CIA report entitled, `Arms Transfers to State Sponsors of Terrorism.' Among the transfers reported are missile guidance components, 400 metric tons of chemicals for Iran's chemical warfare program, and advanced cruise missiles. 
There can be no doubt that China's provision of advanced missile technology and equipment to Iran directly threatens our national security interests and directly contravenes U.S. law. Over the past several years, Iran has purchased Sunburn, C-801 and C-802 antiship cruise missiles, fast attack missile boats, diesel submarines, and naval mine warfare capabilities. 
In addition, Iran has reportedly been constructing tunnels along the coast of the Persian Gulf to shelter ballistic missiles. And Iran may have deployed antishipping missiles on islands at the mouth of the Persian Gulf--which, as anybody who has been there knows, is a natural choke point, useful for strangling our flow of oil through the gulf. 
These new capabilities pose a serious risk to the U.S. naval presence in the region, and to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar's oil and natural gas refineries along the coast. 
The point is, the White House should be prepared to, as it promised, fully and faithfully respond with the sanctions required by law for China's proliferation activities, as the President assured me he would in a letter last year. 
In closing, I welcome Senator Bennett's remarks and his amendment. 
Let me inquire of the Chair if the yeas and nays have been obtained on the amendment.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Wisconsin. I think he knows that. I know his mother-in-law and I put in every personal reference I can, but he is simply wrong on this. He is operating in perfectly good faith, but this is wrong. This provision does not create a new Government agency. What it does is simply keep a current function of USIA and move the rest of them out. It is the only thing left. 
The radios--Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Iran, the Voice of America and the Cuban radio, Radio Marti--will be separate from the Department of State. No new missions are created, no new bureaucracies are established. We simply maintain the independence and editorial integrity of the already-existing radios. 
Warnings that this bill will return us to the old age of corruption and mismanagement are simply not so. As a matter of fact, I was dealing with these radios a long time before the Senator came to the Senate. As the saying goes, I fought the Battle of Jericho many times on this and generally I won. 
This bill simply extends the authority of the State Department inspector general giving the inspector general full oversight over the radios and the entire bureau of broadcasting and gives the Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy a permanent seat on the broadcasting Board of Governors, ensuring that their management will come under the scrutiny of the State Department. And under this legislation, the Director of broadcasting will serve not at the pleasure of the board, as he does today, but rather at the pleasure of the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. 
Lastly, I have heard from the head of every one of these radio entities. And to a man, to a woman, they are opposed to the Senator's amendment. 
Mr. President, I am tempted to move to table, but because of my affection for the distinguished Senator I shall not do that. I will let him have an up-or-down vote. 
I thank the Chair. And we may proceed to a vote.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, while we are waiting for the one remaining amendment to be offered by the Senator from Alaska, let me pay my respects to the young people on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, both Republican and Democrat. But I will speak to and about the young people on the Republican staff, headed by the one and only Admiral James Wilson Nance, moreover known as Bud Nance, who is the chief of staff of the committee, a gentleman whom I have known since we were little boys in Monroe, and who has built that staff to one of the best that has ever been in charge of the foreign affairs side of the Foreign Relations Committee down through the years. 
Then there is Tom Klein, himself a remarkable young man; Chris Walker, he is delightful; Marshall Billingslea, he is my anchor when the wind begins to blow; Ellen Bork, and, yes, she is the daughter of him, and I tell him that the daughter is smarter than he is; Dan Fiske; Garrett Grigsby; Patti McNerney, who you have seen working so diligently this afternoon and on previous occasions; Dany Pletka; Marc Theissen; Beth Wilson; Michael Westphal. 
While I am thanking the Republican staff, I thank Joe Biden for his exceptional cooperation. It has been sort of an arduous task to do all of the detail work that had to be done, but he and I and our mutual staffs, our respective staffs, really, spent many, many hours working together, and here we are almost to the point of asking for third reading. 
The reason I paused, Mr. President, is that we are finishing a fairly long list of en bloc amendments, technical amendments, which is not yet ready. In the meantime, the distinguished Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] is on the floor. I welcome him and yield the floor.

Mr. HELMS. The Senator is quite welcome. 
Mr. President, I am very pleased with the progress that we are making today. 
Mr. President, just for the record, in 1985 a very distinguished Senator named Nancy Kassebaum, and Mr. Solomon on the House side, offered legislation using this very same approach. And it was in enacted into to law for the State Department Authorization Act for fiscal years 1986 and 1987. Who do you reckon was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at that time? It was my very good friend, Senator Lugar of Indiana. If my memory serves me correctly, he supported Nancy Kassebaum, I, and all the rest of us who were interested in the same thing. 
The Clinton administration never requested some of the larger amounts of money involved in the so-called arrearage. Through a normal process of budgeting, the Congress overlooked paying this enormous sum for peacekeeping, principally to our allies in Europe. In fact, the nonpayment of U.N. peacekeeping expenditures in Bosnia was an explicit rebuff by the Congress to a policy, and any suggestion to the contrary is simply not so. But the Clinton administration never requested most of the funds in that budget. It never received congressional approval. The Congress to the contrary explicitly opposed these peacekeeping expenditures. But through a flawed mechanism at the United Nations the Clinton administration at that time could vote for the peacekeeping mission and then after the fact demand the Congress meet the so-called United States obligation to pay. 
So it is a confusing set of circumstances. But the argument that we are somehow being less than honorable in applying some demands is just not reasonable. 
Let's look at another thing. Do we really want to start down the path of who has spent how much on Bosnia? This is an argument which our allies are not going to win. Less than 2 years ago two Cabinet-level officials from the Clinton administration told the Foreign Relations Committee, of which Senator Lugar is a member, and I believe he was present at that time, that the cost incurred for the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia is `going to be in excess of $1 billion, probably $1.5 billion.' Just for the record, the United States has to date spent--guess how much on Bosnia? Mr. President, $6.5 billion. Who is going to reimburse our military and our taxpayers for this expenditure? So where does anybody get off saying we are doing something dishonorable, or unwise, or unreasonable if we are protesting a lot of this stuff that is going on at the United Nations? 
Over $533 million of the so-called United States arrearages for peacekeeping is specifically related to the failed U.N. mission in Bosnia. In support of the amendment, it has been said that the United States did not have troops in Bosnia and, therefore, the United States has an obligation to pay those who did. That argument is not correct either. 
During the period of the U.N. effort in Bosnia, the United States maintained an aircraft carrier battle group off the coast of the former Yugoslavia, a substantial commitment of aircraft to police the no-fly zone over Bosnia, and a military hospital unit in Croatia at an estimated cost of at least $3 billion. Because the Congress prohibited President Clinton from associating our military with the U.N. disaster, the United States did not seek reimbursement for our efforts to contain hostilities in Bosnia. 
If we are going to start talking about paying bills for Bosnia 
and things like that, we can really, really have a strong argument, and I am going to insist that our military and our taxpayers get reimbursed as well. 
So, for me the alternative to the payment of these funds with the conditions in the reform package will not be the no strings attached approach advocated by the Lugar amendment. I will instead oppose any amendment for any reimbursement for the failed U.N. peacekeeping effort in Bosnia. And that is a debate, Mr. President, if we have it, that will be worth having. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Lugar has repeatedly said it is the right thing to do, to vote for his amendment. It is the right thing to do, almost implying that those of us who do not agree with him have, indeed, a character defect. Let me tell you about the Lugar amendment. The effect of the Lugar amendment would be that the United Nations would have absolutely no incentive to reform--none--no incentive to cut the burden on the American taxpayers by reducing our regular budget assessment to 20 percent; no reduction in our peacekeeping assessment; no inspector general in the big three specialized agencies to root out waste, fraud, and corruption; no U.S. seat on the U.N. budgetary committee; no budgetary reductions in the specialized agencies; no sunset provisions for obsolete programs; no GAO access to U.N. financial data; no budgetary reform, and so on and on. 
It may be the right thing to do in Senator Lugar's opinion, but I expect that it is going to be the wrong thing to do, to vote for the Lugar amendment, when the tally is made in just a few minutes. 
Have the yeas and nays been ordered on the amendments? I believe we did that last night. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, before we wrap things up here today, let me express my appreciation to a very special gentleman for his tireless efforts, his hard work and cheerful disposition throughout the entire process of the drafting of the bill just approved by the Senate. Art Rynearson is legislative counsel to the Foreign Relations Committee, and we have truly overworked that gentleman during this year with the drafting sessions on the resolution of ratification for the CWC, often lasting until 2 a.m., and when we finished that we called upon Art to help the committee prepare the resolution of ratification for the CFE Flank Document. No sooner had we finished that, than we called upon him to help with the State Department legislation, and Art worked 70-hour weeks for the past 4 months. Throughout the entire process he has been cheerful and exceedingly helpful. Without him, the process would not have gone nearly so smoothly. 
So, to Art Rynearson, all of us say thanks for everything.

Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, the day and the time have arrived. The pending business, as the distinguished clerk has just indicated, is the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1997, legislation which was reported from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this past Thursday, June 12, by a vote of 14 to 4. 
This legislation provides sweeping and long overdue reforms in America's foreign affairs agencies. It also mandates tough reforms at the United Nations. 
As I have tried to emphasize from the beginning, it has been my hope that the effort to produce this legislation would be a bipartisan one, dedicated to reorganization and revitalization of our foreign policy institutions. That is what this legislation is, and that is what has brought this bill to its present pendency in the Senate. It has been bipartisanship in the Senate, the same kind of honest give and take that led to some of the truly great decisions by this Senate in years past and in past decades. 
There is no point now in rehashing past difficulties or actions either by the Senate or by the President of the United States. The important point is that this time around there has been a remarkable degree of working together, of give and take, and a determination by almost everybody involved that this time a piece of legislation will be enacted by the Congress and signed into law by the President of the United States. 
I would be remiss if I did not mention the distinguished Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, who has made very clear and voluntary public assurances about this legislation. And that lady, Mr. President, has as always stood by her word. 
While all of that is obviously personally meaningful to me, it is no more so than the splendid cooperation and genuine interest of the distinguished Senator from Delaware, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Biden, who not only has made clear his bipartisan support, he has worked tirelessly to make sure that he would be on this Senate floor this afternoon to demonstrate his genuine support for a bill which hereinafter should be and will be known as the Helms-Biden Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1997. I suspect that Senator Biden is aware of how grateful I am to him. He is an able colleague for whom I have enormous respect. 
That said, Mr. President, both President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright came forward with recommendations addressing many, though not all, of my key concerns, and in the ensuing months Senator Biden and I, along with our respective and competent staffs, devoted countless hours putting together this final package which so overwhelmingly was approved by the Foreign Relations Committee this past Thursday. 
None of us got everything we wanted, but we worked together, and the legislation before us today is a bipartisan bill that will abolish two of those temporary Federal agencies that were created a half-century ago--the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the U.S. Information Agency. Moreover, this bill will move some of the functions of a third such `temporary' Federal agency known as the Agency for International Development. These functions will move to a position within the State Department under the direct control and supervision of the Secretary of State. 
I must be candid. If I had my way, and many other Senators feel precisely the same way, the so-called Agency for International Development would be abolished entirely. But that is going to take a little time. So, instead, this bill is the first of many steps in a perhaps lengthy process of reinventing the foreign affairs apparatus of the U.S. Government. But, have no doubt about it, further reforms will happen a little further down the legislative line in the years ahead. 
The ball has begun to roll. But, for now, the pending legislation wipes away the Agency for International Development's often arrogant independence from the Department of State by transferring many of the functions of that independent 50-odd-year-old temporary agency to the State Department, and to assure that the allocation of foreign aid will soon be controlled by the Secretary of State, who will at long last have policy control over our foreign aid program. 
I have thought many times, during the lengthy hours that we have worked on this particular piece of legislation, of what Ronald Reagan once said about temporary Federal agencies. He said, `There is nothing so near eternal life as a temporary Federal agency.' I think the three agencies that we are working on today are an illustration of that. 
In any event, the pending bill will also contain U.N. reform benchmarks that we have been negotiating with the administration for the past 4 months. I think it is fair to say that this bill represents the most comprehensive and most far-reaching U.N. reform package ever considered by this Congress. Indeed, the Washington Post, which is no fan of anybody who wants to reform the United Nations--the Washington Post referred to the plan before the Senate today, and I quote the Washington Post, `* * * as one which would mark the most fundamental shift in relations between the United States and the United Nations since the United Nations was established after World War II.' 
Let's look at a few details a little more closely. Among other reforms, the pending bill will require the United Nations to reduce the amount of money the American taxpayers are now required to contribute to the United Nations, reduce it from the present 25 percent of the total operations cost to 20 percent of the total U.N. operating costs. If you do not think that is much, I will discuss that with you in just a minute. This reduction is going to be in effect, by the way, no later than fiscal year 2000. That one, single reform, two or three lines in this bill, had it been enacted 5 years ago, would have saved the American taxpayers more than $500 million. The bill looks a little bit better as you talk about it and examine it. 
What else is in this bill? This bill requires the United Nations to adopt a real negative growth budget, one that will eliminate at least 1,000 bureaucratic U.N. posts, so that the American taxpayers in the future will pay a smaller percentage of a smaller budget. 
It will forbid future U.N. global conferences, for example the Beijing women's summit that caused such a stir in this country and elsewhere, and the Rio Earth summit, meaning that the American taxpayers will never, never again be forced to pay the exorbitant costs of such boondoggles as those two that I mentioned. 
The pending bill will require the United Nations to reimburse the American taxpayers for U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations. And that means that the U.S. defense budget will no longer be raided to support U.N. experimentation with peacekeeping operations. 
Most important, this bill provides a very significant aspect. It forbids requiring the American taxpayers to furnish the money to pay any so-called U.N. arrearages unless and until the requirements in this bill have been met by the United Nations. 
A lot of crabbing is going on about it, and a lot of speculation about whether they will like it or not up there. They don't like it. You know who doesn't care one whit whether they like it or not? You are looking at him, Mr. President. My message to the United Nations is simple but clear: No reform, no American taxpayers' money for arrearages. 
Last, and certainly not least, this legislation imposes very strict and very specific disciplines on spending and authorizing funding for the Department of State and other related agencies. 
Let me repeat for the purpose of emphasis. This legislation is bipartisan. It does not contain everything that I wanted. Senator Biden is a tough and fair negotiator. Nor does it reflect everything that the other side--Joe Biden and the Democrats--not everything that they wanted is in here. But, in the end, at the end of the day, as is so often said these days, I believe it is evident that the Foreign Relations Committee is proposing important reforms that will be highly beneficial to this country and to the American taxpayers. 
So I say again, it is truly a team effort by both sides, and I hasten to mention that it would not have been possible without the extraordinary efforts of the chairman of the International Operations Subcommittee, Senator Rod Grams, who 
devoted so many hours presiding over oversight hearings on important aspects of this bill. Senator Grams worked with us every step of the way in crafting the legislation which I have just described in some detail. Moreover, Senator Grams' special expertise, gained by his having served as the U.S. Congressional Delegate to the United Nations, has been enormously helpful in the crafting of this comprehensive U.N. reform proposal. And then the committee has also worked closely with Senator Judd Gregg, the distinguished chairman of the appropriations subcommittee which has the responsibility, don't you know, for the Departments of Commerce, State, and Justice. Senator Gregg's support for this bill, this pending bill, sent a message to the administration early on that the appropriators as well as the authorizers of the U.S. Senate would be standing together, united in support of this pending bill. 
Needless to say, I sincerely hope that the spirit of bipartisanship will continue and that the Senate will expeditiously complete action on it.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I do not know whether the distinguished occupant of the Chair has noticed, but we have 20 new pages as of today. Every year I say they can't get any better, but they do. They are fine young people who come here from all across the country. They work hard, as they will discover as the days go by and the temperature gets hot in the debate, and messages will be floating back and forth like Tennyson's brook. 
But I want you to know that here is one Senator who welcomes you. I am proud of you. I think you are going to enjoy your time in the Senate. 
Mr. President, I hear from the pages, former pages, of years ago, with some regularity. They send me pictures of their new babies. They send me pictures of themselves and in their wedding gowns. It is interesting to track all these young people as they have moved into maturity and have become good citizens. I even know of two who are serving in State legislatures now. So, tempus fugit. 
When I came on to the Senate floor from the cloakroom, I was told that the wrap-up material would be presented in about a minute. It will be here. And I am not going to suggest the absence of a quorum. So there. 
These young people are lucky, I might add, because there is no school in the summertime, is there? But the rest of the year, they start school at 6:15 in the morning. Classes begin then. And unless the Senate runs past--what is it?--10 o'clock in the evening--the 6:15 a.m. time is still in effect for the pages. 
So now I feel like I am back in television with producers standing in the background saying `Stretch it. Stretch it.' 
I guess I may as well suggest the absence of a quorum.

To begin, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today it stand in adjournment until the hour of 10 o'clock a.m. on Tuesday, June 17. And I further ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, immediately following the Chaplain's prayer, the routine requests through the morning hour be granted and the Senate then be in a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m. with Senators permitted to speak for up to 5 minutes with the following exceptions: Senator Hagel and Senator Leahy who will have 30 minutes jointly.

Originally it was to have been divided equally between Senator Biden and me, and I thought in fairness to Senator Lugar it ought to be made equal between Senator Lugar, Senator Biden, and me. 
Further, Mr. President, at the hour of 12 noon, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the DeWine amendment No. 383, to be immediately followed by a vote on or in relation to the Lugar amendment No. 382, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided before each vote. Following those votes, the Senate will recess until the hour of 2:15 p.m. for the weekly policy luncheon meetings.

Mr. HELMS. I understand that. But I respect the Senator from Maryland. I want him to have his say. 
Certainly, Mr. President, I am not going to criticize Senator Lugar. I think and hope we have been friends ever since he came here. I have made several statements publicly in his advocacy. I think he will acknowledge that. But he is not in a position in which he has to make judgments that will lead to either a successful piece of legislation or an unsuccessful one, depending on which decision is made. 
Senator Biden has very eloquently and accurately described the process by which the committee brought in a lot of views and a lot of people, including the distinguished majority leader, Trent Lott, and the relevant appropriations subcommittee chair Judd Gregg. As I said in my statement earlier, this bill will not represent every provision that I want, but I think it is the best legislation for the American people. I do not need any pollster to tell me that; in fact, I have found out that the results often depend on who the pollster is taking a poll for and what the people who paid for the poll want to accomplish with the poll. That certainly is a game that is played in politics constantly. 
But let me say that speaking, I think, for a sizable percentage of the American people--and not having a poll except the ringing of the telephone in my office and the fax machine grinding constantly and the mail by the sackfuls--we do not owe it to the rest of the world to pay the so-called arrearages to the United Nations for peacekeeping, 
and we certainly do not owe these nickel and dime amounts to our allies or to anyone else, for that matter. 
Let me set the record straight just a bit. I do not say this with any hostility, but if you think the American people have not been socked with enough taxes to support whatever project or institution that is supported at the moment, let's look at the facts. Since 1950 the United States--that means the American taxpayers--has given other countries (free of charge) $120 billion in military assistance through grants and loans. In just the past 10 years, the United States paid $40.4 billion in military assistance to another set of countries. I have heard no moaning and groaning on this floor about what we owe, but nothing about all of the support the U.S. has given. 
When you add up the low-cost and no-cost loans to the total assistance that the American taxpayers have been forced by their Government--by this Senate, by the House of Representatives, by the President sitting in the Oval Office on Pennsylvania Avenue --the total assistance that the American taxpayers have given out since 1950 amounts to at least $161 billion--and mind you, that does not include interest that has been forgiven when we didn't seek repayment of loans. 
In addition, every dime of this has been given away in years when we did not balance the budget. These costs are part of the reason that we have a $5.400 trillion federal debt today. So let me be clear--we long have bankrolled the world, and I will cry tomorrow for those ambassadors from France and Germany, and even Poland, who say that they do not like what Jesse Helms is doing in the Senate. Well, Jesse Helms does not like to have to do it, but some of us have reached the point that we have to hold hands tight and work out a deal that will achieve long overdue reforms. 
Now, this pending bill is the proposition that has been agreed to by the President of the United States, by the Secretary of State, by Joe Biden--who is the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee--and by countless other distinguished Americans whom we have consulted and with whom we have worked. 
Now, let me tell you something. It is easy to sit back and say, `Well, we have got to pay our debts.' With what and on what schedule? Are you going to add it to the federal debt? What are you going to cut out of the budget which we have been unable, thus far, to get balanced in this body and in the House of Representatives and then signed by the President? 
We all hear that there is a coalition of interests, but my primary interest happens to be the people who pick up their lunch pail and go to work every morning, who do not know much about Congress. They are trusting us to protect their future and the futures of their children and grandchildren. Now, every campaign they are celebrated as the reason Joe Candidate and Mary Candidate are running for office, looking for votes. But as soon as the election is over, you do not hear much more except a political speech now and then. 
Now, I have been on the Foreign Relations Committee quite a while. Joe Biden and I held up our hands to take the oath of office on the same day--January 3, 1973, right over in that corner. We have been in the Senate the same length of time. I have enjoyed serving with Senator Biden because although he and I seldom agree on fundamental issues, he always shoots straight with me--and I think that he will say that I have shot straight with him. I am a conservative and I am unabashed about it. And Joe, no doubt about it, is a liberal. That is the way it goes in this body. 
But also on the Foreign Relations Committee some years ago, I think in the mid-1980s, one of the bad ladies who served on the committee--now, I am not even going to joke about it. She is one of the sweetest ladies I have ever known, one of the brightest ladies I have ever known, and one of the most unyielding ladies I have ever known-- and her name was Nancy Kassebaum. It is now Nancy Kassebaum Baker because she is the bride of Howard Baker, the former majority leader of this Senate. 
Now, it was, I believe, 1986 an amendment was enacted into law in the State Department Authorization Act. And by the way how many authorization bills have been passed since that year? Not many, not many. So the affairs of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. President, have been handled by the Appropriations Committee until this year and we are endeavoring to have the Foreign Relations Committee resume its rightful place in the conduct of foreign affairs. I do not think it ought to be conducted by the Appropriations Committee. 
But in any case, our former colleague from Kansas, the then Nancy Kassebaum, used a very interesting approach more than a decade ago in trying to get a budget reform at the United Nations. She was so disappointed and so was I with the way the United Nations was being operated. Her amendment was enacted into law for the authorization act for fiscal years 1986 and 1987. It explicitly and unilaterally withheld 20 percent of the U.S. contribution to the United Nations and its specialized agency until voting reforms took place at the U.N. Now, I must ask, what is so unusual about this bill? We are including provisions that require reforms in the same way--by withholding U.S. contributions. I do not know whether Senator Lugar was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee at that time. If he was, I doubt that he very strongly opposed Senator Kassebaum. 
But the point is we have so many people who have responsible roles to play in this matter. We are hearing from the President and former Presidents, we are hearing from Secretaries of State and former Secretaries of State, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, as Yul Brenner said in `The King and I.'

Mr. HELMS. I appreciate the remarks that Senator Lugar has made. But I just wish there would be some understanding of what our options are. Sure, we could watch Senator Lugar talk about it, but we will end up with the Appropriations Committee running for the Senate our role in the foreign policy apparatus. 
I admire Senator Lugar, always have, always will, and I refuse to get in a fuss with him. His amendment is dictating to all those who have worked for months to arrive at a consensus piece of legislation how to do things when he does not have any workable alternative. I will still respect him, but I say that the Foreign Relations Committee, and the Senate, has for the first time in a long time the opportunity to take its rightful place in the procedure of determining the foreign policy apparatus of this country. 
I will have more to say, if necessary, as time goes by, but I hope the Senator will not press his amendment. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. 
Exhibit 1 June 12, 1997. 
Hon. Jesse Helms, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, Senate Dirksen Office Building Washington, DC. 
Dear Jesse: I want to take this opportunity to commend you for a job well done on your United Nations reform legislation. I know you have spent many hours ensuring that our national interests--and the interests of American taxpayers--are better protected at the United Nations. 
As you know, I have long supported efforts to achieve reforms in United Nations peacekeeping and in the other areas of U.N. operations. The personnel, budgetary and organization reforms your legislation requires before additional U.S. funds go to the U.N. are comprehensive and long-overdue. I am pleased to see your legislation effectively precludes U.N. efforts to create a standing army, impose taxation or control U.S. property. I am particularly supportive of the provision which requires U.N. reimbursement for all costs associated with U.S. support for U.N. peacekeeping, and the provision which lowers the U.S. annual assessment for the U.N. budget. If such provisions had been in place in 1993, U.S. taxpayers would have saved literally billions of dollars. 
You have put together an impressive piece of legislation. I congratulate you for leading a difficult effort that will result in a more efficient and more limited United Nations, and help ensure that American interests come first in our policy toward the United Nations. 
I am writing this letter solely on my own behalf and the opinions expressed herein are my own. 
Sincerely, Bob Dole.

For the time being, I hope that the distinguished Senator from Ohio would be recognized to offer an amendment, and that the pending amendments be laid aside temporarily, at the conclusion of which I would appreciate the Chair recognizing me for any further comment that I may have received from the majority leader in regard to how late we will stay here tonight.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I support this amendment and I have a hunch that most Senators will. I will be surprised if there are many Senators who will not support the amendment. 
Since the United States returned Aristide to power in Haiti, there have been dozens upon dozens of politically motivated assassinations carried out by Haitian security forces trained by the United States. These people who have been assassinated in almost all cases, as I understand it, have been opponents of Mr. Aristide. Does the Senator agree with that?

Mr. HELMS. Right. In any case, Mr. President, despite the American taxpayers being required to put up the money to prop up the Haitian Government with U.S. troops, and the expenditure of something like $2 billion, the Haitian Government has rebuffed all of the attempts by our Government to investigate these murders. The human rights situation has disintegrated to such a point that last year President Clinton had to rush diplomatic security officers to Haiti to protect Aristide's replacement, President Preval, from his own palace security guards whom the United States had trained and equipped. 
Here is one example of so-called justice in Haiti today. Michel Gonzalez lived next door to Mr. Aristide. Mr. Gonzalez was gunned down in May of 1995 outside of his home after refusing to sell his property to Mr. Aristide. The Haitian Government claims that the autopsy report was lost and the Haitian Government refuses to turn over critical evidence to the U.S. Government. 
One of those implicated in orchestrating the assassination is Dany Toussaint, who got a U.S. green card as an `agricultural worker'--and I wish I knew how to put oral quotation marks around agricultural worker. In any case, he has been allowed to roam free in the United States, and in Haiti. It seems to me that spending $2 billion on a regime that protects murderers is bad enough, but allowing these assassins to come into the United States is quite another thing. It is not only asinine; it is breathtaking in its stupidity. 
In 1993 and 1994, I took some flak as a Senator because I warned that when Aristide and his cronies were fully disclosed, the record would be clear that they are or were anti-American thugs. There is no other way to put it. Aristide himself rose to prominence making hate-filled diatribes against the United States of America. He accused the United States of having some strange diabolic design on Haiti. 
Now, I noticed in yesterday's Washington Post a report that Mr. Aristide is engineering a bid to resume power in Haiti even though it is against Haiti's Constitution for him to be President again. 
According to this article, and I quote from the Washington Post: `Arrested is rallying his militants by blaming U.S. imperialism for the woes of Haiti's poor.' That is some thanks, I guess, for the billions of dollars of American taxpayers' money spent in Haiti or on behalf of Haiti. 
There is no getting around the fact that the lives of American servicemen and women were put at risk and billions of taxpayer dollars have been wasted to prop up a government run by corrupt cronies of Arrested--people who hate America and who sanction assassinations against political opponents. 
Mr. President, it boils down to this: If the Haitian Government will not prosecute these assassins, the least we can do is deny them U.S. visas. 
I wonder if Senator Biden is available. I would like to get the yeas and nays. I presume the Senator wants the yeas and nays?

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending June 6, the United States imported 8,429,000 barrels of oil each day, 421,000 barrels more than the 8,008,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 56.6 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By U.S. producers using American workers? 
Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 8,429,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this past Saturday, June 7, marked the 30th anniversary of the reunification of the city of Jerusalem. Prior to 1967, Jerusalem was a city divided, its center scarred by concrete and barbed wire, with many of its residents displaced. Israel's recovery of Jerusalem during the Six-Day War ended that ugly partition and restored the ability of visitors and residents of all religions to worship freely and visit important holy sites in Jerusalem. 
For my part, I am convinced that Jerusalem should remain the unified capital of the State of Israel. I have consistently supported measures before the Congress expressing opposition to the division of the holy city. 
The Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act, passed in 1995, definitively expressed Congress' heartfelt belief that Jerusalem should not only remain the capital of the State of Israel, but that the United States should recognize it as such. 
Jerusalem occupies a central place in the Christian, Islamic, and Jewish faiths and I believe it is crucial to each of these great traditions that Jerusalem remain undivided and its holy sites open. 
I urge that the President and the State Department declare their support for a free, united Jerusalem, and to avoid interfering in negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians on the status of the holy city. 
Mr. President, in these last 30 years, the holy city of Jerusalem has flourished, not just for Israel, but for all people. Nobody can claim complete ownership of one of the spiritual centers of the world. But we can all congratulate the State of Israel on its excellent stewardship.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we live in a time when so many United States leaders, both in and out of Government, are apprehensive lest the so-called People's Republic of China be offended at the slightest suggestion that the basic principles of justice, human rights, and freedom should be applicable to the actions of the Communist leaders in Beijing as well as to all the rest of us. 
Mr. President, are the American people supposed to live in fear and nervous anticipation when even the barest questions about Communist China's conduct are raised? Are we supposed to pretend that the gross violations of trade by Communist China are not happening every day? Are we supposed to cringe in fear when the leaders in Beijing threaten the destruction of San Francisco? 
Surely the greatness of America is not to be diminished by the bullying threats flowing from mainland China. 
Mr. President, these thoughts came to my mind over the weekend when I received from a prominent and respected American the text of an address delivered on May 22, less than 3 weeks ago, before the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium. 
Who delivered it? It was delivered by an honorable and distinguished gentleman, John Chang, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China on Taiwan. My purpose in being here this afternoon is to express my hope that every Senator will read the text of Mr. Chang's remarks, and, while doing so, compare his rhetoric with that flowing constantly from mainland China.

I doubt that there is any one of us whose life has not been touched by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. He has certainly touched mine time and time again, beginning with that day back in early 1972 when a very brief, speculative item appeared on page umpteen of newspapers around the country saying that a fellow named Helms might seek the Republican nomination for the Senate from North Carolina. 
Early that morning, Senator Strom Thurmond, to my utter delight, was on the telephone calling from Washington urging that I do run and assuring me that if I did and if I wanted him to, he would come to North Carolina and campaign for me. 
Mr. President, I did and Strom did. As a matter of fact, he did it time and time again. If I count correctly, he flew with me that year, in a very small plane, six times back and forth across North Carolina, telling the people of my State, Democrats and Republicans alike, that they ought to send Jesse Helms to Washington. I will never forget it. 
I remember one episode in particular, since we are all remembering nice things about Senator Thurmond. We were at a farm rally outside of Hickory, NC, after a grueling day of eight stops with that small plane, and he made a stemwinder speech at every one of them. I was getting more and more tired. We ended up at this farm, and there were about 400 people at that rally because they were giving away free barbecue and because Strom Thurmond was there. The barbecue caterer was late. He got lost trying to find the place. So they decided to let Senator Thurmond speak and they asked me to introduce my guest. I was a weary guy when I got up, and I introduced Senator Thurmond with such eloquence as I could muster at that time of night after such a day. Well, there came another stemwinder and the last 10 minutes of the stemwinder, we saw the barbecue truck roll in. Everybody had barbecue and then we went home. 
In the car going to the motel I heard the most awful sound I ever heard in my life. He said, `Jesse, when we get to the motel, I want to call my wife. She's in a family way, you know, and I want to be sure she's all right. And, after that, I understand it's about a mile to downtown, would you want to run downtown and back with me?' 
I said, `Senator, if I could crawl to the bed, that's the best I'm going to be able to do.' But he did. He ran downtown and he ran back and he was up at 6 o'clock next morning. 
Thanks to my dear friend, the people did send me to Washington, and I have been here for almost a quarter of a century now, watching that great man from South Carolina serve in the Senate and break record after record. I have been enormously proud of a lot of things. I guess one of the most profound things was when the Senator and Mrs. Thurmond invited me to become the godfather of that beautiful young lady, Juliana Thurmond. 
So I am proud to have served with Senator Thurmond. He is a remarkable American because he has always been a hard-working, honest, and reliable Senator. His friends back home--as a matter of fact his friends all over the country--know that they can always count on Strom Thurmond to do what he says he will do. Let me tell you something, Mr. President, South Carolina is far the better off today because Strom Thurmond has been in the Senate representing the State of South Carolina. Moreover, and just as important, the U.S. Senate is better because Strom Thurmond has been here. And so is the country, better off. 
Congratulations, my dear friend and Senator, you have been a good and faithful servant, and all of us are proud of you. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in offering this resolution, Mr. President, which formally disapproves President Clinton's renewal of MFN for China, I am pleased that the able Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] is a principal cosponsor of the resolution of disapproval. 
In moving around my State during the Memorial Day recess I was impressed with the attitude of a majority of North Carolinians who are absolutely persuaded that the United States must conduct its policy toward China on the basis of morality as well as pragmatism. It has made no sense either morally or practically for the United States to have conducted its China policy as it has for so long. 
There are many who are asserting the truth that the term MFN, which stands for most favored nation, is certainly a misnomer. MFN, in fact, means that a country gets trade treatment as good as anybody else's, not that it gets more favorable treatment than any other country. I accept that and I oppose MFN on exactly those grounds. China gets the same trade treatment that virtually everybody else gets. When a country like China gets normal trade relations with the United States it is getting better treatment than China deserves. That is just plain foolish. 
Those who favor MFN for Communist China also like to point out that other countries with at least equally dubious records--like Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Burma--qualify for MFN without an annual debate. Therefore, the proMFN crowd says China ought to get MFN without an annual debate. 
I dissent. The trouble with that, Mr. President, is this. Those people who rely on the cases of these countries to make their points about MFN for China just have not done their homework. It is disingenuous at best for the proMFN lobby to create the impression that Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria, enjoy MFN status, because they absolutely do not. MFN for Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya is a moot point since nearly all trade is banned with them due to their involvement in state-sponsored terrorism. 
Burma may technically have MFN status but it, also, is the subject of a ban on new United States investment. Syria and Burma both are denied low-tariff benefits under the generalized system of preferences. Besides that, policies against individual countries have evolved in response to historical developments and the needs of U.S. policy. No proponent of MFN renewal would say that the United States should treat every country exactly the same way regardless of specific conditions inside the country, the type of government it has, or the type of threat it poses to the United States or to the neighbors of the United States. 
Now, China is a special case, Mr. President. When you stop to think about it there is no valid reason for the United States--this is the world's leader in freedom--offering the same trading terms for China that the United States offers to other nations that do honor their citizens' human rights and that do respect the rule of law. Now, there can be no such thing as normal trade with the world's largest country, a Communist system engaging in proliferation of conventional nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. 
A country of which our State Department can say, there was not a single dissident active in 1996. 
A country which is violating commitments it made in an international agreement to preserve Hong Kong's institutions and way of life virtually intact. 
A country whose economy is built on prison labor and Peoples Liberation Army joint ventures with U.S. companies. 
A country which fires missiles across the Taiwan strait in an attempt to intimidate the people of Taiwan from conducting democratic elections. 
A country which makes money from organ transplants taken from prisoners, who have just been shot in the head. 
A country which has a policy of forced abortion. 
A country which has systematically destroyed Tibet's religion and culture. 
A country which violates international law in the South China Sea. 
A country which has a huge and growing trade deficit with the United States. 
It matters not whether one calls China's trade status most favored nation, or normal trade relations as the White House Office of `newspeak' wishes to call it. Either way, it's a bad policy, when one considers that in every important area of United States-China relations--from weapons proliferation, to human rights, to trade and intellectual property, to Hong Kong--the White House crowd has made the word `engagement' synonymous with the word `appeasement.' 
Let's talk for a little while about China's record of weapons proliferation. In April, a subcommittee of the Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by the able Senator from Mississippi, [Mr. Cochran], held a hearing which laid out the truth about Chinese proliferation, that this administration has repeatedly failed to impose sanctions required by United States law for China's transfers of equipment, components and weapons of mass destruction to Iran and Pakistan. 
On human rights, the State Department acknowledges continued widespread abuse of human rights by China. This year's annual human rights report catalogues violations of rights of speech, assembly, and association, and abuses including extra-judicial punishment, prison labor, and religious repression. 
Even more shocking than the extent of these abuses is the administration's refusal to use United States leverage to influence China, or even United States allies. This year, the United States failed to mount a credible campaign to introduce and pass a resolution condemning Chinese human rights abuses at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. 
The Commission's meeting is not a mystery. It is scheduled a year in advance. Yet this administration did almost no lobbying until the last minute. That's because the administration hoped against hope that the Vice President's trip to China would result in some concessions by the Chinese which would enable the administration to abandon the resolution once and for all. 
But just guess what happened. China did not make concessions to Vice President Gore and the Clinton administration was left trying to put together a coalition at Geneva. 
In trade, the story is the same. There is absolutely no improvement. The United States trade deficit with China climbed once again this year, to just under 40 percent. According to the President, that's an increase of 17 percent over last year. United States companies have precious little access to China's market, even as they are pouring investment into China. Sometimes, United States companies deal with the People's Liberation Army. Sometimes they deal with factories using with prison labor. That is the way the game is played--under cover, under the table. 
The United States buys 30 percent of China's exports. Yet China makes up just 2 percent of the United States export market--30 vs. 2. This past year, United States exports to Taiwan, Hong Kong--and even to Belgium, if you believe that, were greater than United States exports to China, even though the populations of each of these countries are a tiny fraction of China's population. 
Just the same, we hear the same old rhetoric from certain businessmen. They come to my office day after day. I like them. I am sorry I can't agree with them. But I tell them I do not agree with them. They sit there and contend that the United States needs to trade with China. It will open up society; that is to say, the Chinese society, they say. But what is going on in China isn't free trade but trade on the Chinese Government's terms, which can be changed every hour on the hour. 
The Chinese military operates commercial enterprises. Let me repeat that. The Chinese military army, all the rest of it, they are in business. They do that so they can pay for the ever-growing cost of operating their military establishment--and, by the way, collect technology from the United States and other sucker governments who send it to them. 
No rule of law protects Chinese or foreign investors. Official corruption is widespread, and everybody knows it. A disagreement with a business partner who has an official connection can land you in jail in China, or worse. You might be one of the guys hauled out on that field tomorrow morning with a bullet through your head so that one of your organs can be sold for $40,000 cash money. 
Want a run down of stories you won't hear from those lobbying Congress for MFN? 
In 1994, Revpower, a Florida company won an international arbitration award against a Chinese state-owned enterprise. Despite China's obligations as a party to the 1958 Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, China has failed to enforce the award in its courts. 
In 1994, James Peng, an Australian citizen, was seized by Chinese police in Macau--which is not yet under Chinese control--and taken to China. In this case, the court found Peng innocent of any wrongdoing, but local officials who saw an opportunity to extort money from Peng and his partners. Peng has been in jail ever since. 
Troy McBride, a United States businessman, had his passport seized and was detained for several weeks in a hotel in China in 1995. You can read about this in last year's State Department Human Rights Report. 
According to the Chicago Tribune, Philip Cheng, a Chinese-American, was jailed without charges in 1993 over a dispute with his joint venture partner. In the story about Mr. Cheng, a Western diplomat was quoted as saying:  
When a deal goes sour we only hear about the worst cases. But dozens, perhaps hundreds of businessmen have been mobbed, punched and even jailed to make them pay what the locals demand. In most cases the victims make no fuss because their companies want to keep doing business in China. 
Zhang Gueixing, a U.S. resident immigrant was imprisoned for 2 1/2 years in connection with a dispute over bicycles. While in prison, Zhang witnessed executions of prisoners. 
China has steadily reneged on its commitments in the 1984 Joint Declaration. In that agreement, China promised that Hong Kong would have an elected legislature, an accountable executive, an independent judiciary, and a broad range of personal and political freedoms including rights of speech, assembly, association, and religion. For the past several years China has first announced a violation of the joint declaration, then carried it out. This is all a matter of public record. 
Yet, the United States has failed to prevent or reverse a single violation of the joint declaration. How can it when the administration's official position is that the United States is not entitled to say what does or does not violate the Joint Declaration? 
Where the President will not lead, the Congress must act. An editorial from The Weekly Standard noted that:  
The Clinton Administration obstinately refuses to link U.S. China policy to anything the Chinese do or fail to do. Linkage must be reestablished; equilibrium must be restored to the relationship between the United States and its most troublesome and persistent challenger. That mission falls to the Congress by default. 
For far too long, the United States has failed to recognize and use its leverage over China. 
Mr. President, revoking MFN will not be the end of our China policy. MFN is the means toward restoring equilibrium in the relationship. 
China scholar Harry Harding's book, `A Fragile Relationship,' chronicles the early 1990's, when there was a real threat of MFN revocation in response to the Tiananmen Square Massacre. In response to the threat Beijing ended martial law, released several hundred political prisoners, bought Boeing aircraft and let a prominent dissident out of the country. 
The Congress should withhold MFN status for China this year, otherwise the administration will continue to acquiesce to every violation of international law, international agreement, bilateral agreement, and United States law. The administration's policy toward China has been an abject failure. Abject, means both `utterly hopeless' and `shamelessly servile.' Which, it seems to me, fairly sums up the situation. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Lieberman and I are submitting today a Senate concurrent resolution in support of Taiwan's admission to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
There is simply no reason that Taiwan should be excluded from these multilateral economic institutions. Taiwan has one of the largest trading economies in the world. In fact, in the time it took me to draft this concurrent resolution, Taiwan went from the 20th largest gross domestic product, to the 19th largest. 
Moreover, Taiwan is a democracy and a responsible member of the international community. This is more than one can say about many other nations who are currently members of these multilateral institutions. 
Mr. President, the purpose of this resolution is straightforward. It expresses the sense of the Senate that Taiwan deserves to belong to these organizations. This resolution is not directed against any other nation. It simply puts the Senate on record in favor of justice for Taiwan.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Domenici is absolutely correct. If the Senator from Massachusetts wants to render nugatory the work of all the Senators who labored so long to produce a budget, his amendment is the way to do it. 
At stake, Mr. President, are the livelihoods of this country's tobacco farm families as Senators Kennedy and Hatch attempt to extract an additional $30 billion tax increase from the American taxpayers by upping the existing 24-cent excise tax to 67 cents. 
The impact of this proposal, if enacted, would not only devastate the Southeastern economy; it will harm the entire country. It will be harmful to the lives of thousands of farm families, to the manufacturing workers who stand to lose their jobs, to the retail-store owner and his employees, to the truck driver who delivers the product to market, to the farm implement dealer who supplies the tobacco farmer, to the schools financed by taxes levied on tobacco farmers, and on and on. 
Mr. President, this tax increase will cost thousands of fine North Carolinians their jobs; it will effectively destroy the livelihoods of thousands of small family tobacco farmers. 
According to American Economics Group, Inc., nearly 662,402 citizens are employed in the production, manufacturing, and marketing of tobacco. If enacted, the 43-cent excise tax on tobacco products would abolish 43,000 jobs nationwide, and North Carolina alone would lose 17,849 jobs. 
Furthermore, any increase in the cigarette excise tax will fall disproportionally on lower- and middle-income consumers--the citizens least able to pay it. Those earning less than $30,000 annually already pay 5 times more in excise taxes than those earning $60,000 or more. Those families earning less than $30,000 pay a staggering 47 percent of all tobacco excise taxes, yet these families earn only 16 percent of national family income. 
Make no mistake about it--the tobacco tax is not a user fee as so often claimed by the proponents of this amendment--it is a tax increase. We all know that when excise taxes are increased on any product, sales of that product decrease. If tobacco revenues fall short of projections--which will certainly be the case because there will be a substantially smaller tax base--how will the shortfall be made up? More taxes? What other group will be singled out to shoulder this financial burden? 
Tobacco has been targeted for enormous tax increases because it is an easy way for this Government to take even more money out of the taxpayers' pockets. Smokers, tobacco farmers, and those who work in the tobacco industry should not be singled out to shoulder the burden of paying for the health care of uninsured children. 
The anti smoking zealots have made clear that they are willing to do almost anything in order to tax tobacco right out of existence. They do not care about the 18,000 people in North Carolina alone who stand to lose their jobs. The proponents of this amendment talk about all the children they are trying to insure with the revenues from this tax. Well, I can guarantee that they'll be able to add more uninsured children to that list if this tax is enacted. There will be a number of folks without work, and a number of children who will suffer because of it. 
Once we head down this road of using the taxing power of Government to discourage Americans from undertaking activities Congress and the White House find objectionable, or politically incorrect, where will it stop? 
This tax discriminates against an entire region, an entire industry, and all people who use tobacco products.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending May 16, the U.S. imported 7,834,000 barrels of oil each day, 52,000 barrels more than the 7,782,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 54.8 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by U.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 7,834,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have just presented a bill to the clerk, S. 763, the goal of which is to strike a decisive blow in the war against drugs by protecting America's schoolchildren from the scourge of drugs in their classrooms. 
Before anyone says, `Here we go again,' I counsel all to consider the differences between this bill and anything which was enacted before. 
Incidentally, I am honored to be joined in the sponsorship of this measure by several distinguished Senators--Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Sessions. 
Specifically, this legislation will require each school accepting Federal education funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to adopt a zero tolerance policy regarding illegal drugs and illegal drug paraphernalia in schools. Zero tolerance means what it sounds like. It requires the expulsion, for not less than 1 year, of any student who possesses this contraband at school. This will send a clear message to students, parents, and teachers: Drugs and schools do not mix. 
Illegal drug use is, in my judgment, the most insidious and destructive influence in our country today. Its cost to society, in terms of crime and wasted lives, is enormous. Just think of the innocent babies born already addicted to drugs; think of the families destroyed because fathers, mothers, or children care more about where they will get their next fix than they do their loved ones; think of the neighborhoods that have been devastated by swaggering drug dealers peddling poison. These terrible things are going on right in the shadow of this Capitol in which the U.S. Senate operates. 
Mr. President, Americans have heard these tragic stories so often that some citizens have questioned the wisdom of waging war against drugs. Last fall, California and Arizona voters took the unprecedented step of legalizing the so-called medicinal use of drugs, such as marijuana, heroin, and LSD, and in an outrageous decision reported recently, a Federal judge in San Francisco, Judge Fern Smith, ruled that the Federal Government cannot impose sanctions on doctors who recommend marijuana to their patients, despite the fact that such use remains illegal under Federal law. 
Is it not time to say enough is enough? Is it not time to go all out in the drug war? Mr. President, the answers to these questions are obvious: It is time and we must do it. It is time to take every possible step to reverse this retreat from responsibility, and eliminating drugs from America's classrooms is the imperative, inescapable first step. 
Anybody wondering if this bill is needed should take a look at the results of the latest `Monitoring the Future' [MTF] study of drug use among America's 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-graders and `The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse' study which measures drug use among the general population. Both studies dramatically confirm what many of us have known: We have lost ground in the war against drugs over the past 4 years. Most disturbing is the shocking increase in illicit drug use by our school-age children. 
The findings in the `Monitoring the Future' study are eye-opening: 50 percent of 12th-graders have used illicit drugs during their lifetime; about 25 percent have used drugs during the past 30 days; almost one-third of 8th-graders have used illegal drugs during their lifetime; with about 15 percent of 8th-graders using it in the last 30 days. Marijuana use among 8th- and 10th-graders almost tripled from 1992 to 1996, while 5 percent of 12th-grade marijuana users are daily users. 
But perhaps the most distressing finding is that the youngest students surveyed, our 8th-graders, report the highest rate of heroin use. Moreover, the percentage of actual drug use may be even greater than reported, because the MTF does not survey school dropouts. Instead, it relies solely on student self-reporting. 
Similarly, `The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse' found startling increases in drug use among teenagers over the last 4 years. For example, the survey found that teen cocaine use increased 166 percent in 1 year, 1994-95; teen use of LSD and other hallucinogens skyrocketed 183 percent from 1992 to 1995; and the use of marijuana among teenagers soared 141 percent over the same period. 
So, Mr. President, it is no coincidence that drug use among our children has skyrocketed. Drug dealers deliberately target our young people to be both consumers and distributors of illicit drugs because our children are our most precious and vulnerable resource. As a result, students report that drugs are now the No. 1 problem they face, far outdistancing any other concern. That, by the way, was the finding of a recent survey conducted by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. And what an alarming conclusion it was, that it is our students who are on the front lines of the war against drugs. 
Today, students of all ages have immediate access to a wide variety of drugs that are cheaper and more powerful than those of the past. According to the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, 69 percent of 17-year-olds report going to schools where students keep, use, and sell drugs. Here in the Nation's Capital authorities have closed unsafe schools for fire code violations, yet thousands of children still attend drug-infested schools. Billions of dollars spent on schools will accomplish little, Mr. President, if we do not first ensure that our children are safe there. 
The relationship between violence and drug use is clear. The most recent national Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education [PRIDE] survey found that students who carried guns to school were 20 times more likely to use cocaine than those who did not bring a gun to school. Gang members were 12 times more likely to use cocaine, and students who threaten others were 6 times more likely to be coke users. 
The findings of a recent Department of Education report prepared by the Research Triangle Institute, in my home State of North Carolina, confirmed the findings of the PRIDE study. The Research Triangle Institute, found--and I quote--`[t]he use of drugs was related to violent behavior in schools. A much larger percentage of current users of alcohol and/or other drugs (32 percent of them) reported being involved in school fights as the aggressors than did current nonusers (14 percent of those students) or students who had never tried drugs (6 percent).' 
Mr. President, that report went on to say that 37 percent of the students reported that they are afraid of attacks at school while 29 percent said they feared attacks when traveling to and from school. And, sadly, we must acknowledge that those fears are too often justifiable. 
According to the North Carolina Center for the Prevention of School Violence, over 8,100 incidents of school violence were reported in North Carolina during the last full school year. Possession of a controlled substance, possession of a weapon other than a firearm, and assault on a school employee together accounted for 85 percent of those incidents. That study concluded: `[t]he high number of reported weapon possessions may be reflective of student concern for their own safety, even in schools, since the most often cited reason for carrying weapons * * * is `protection'.' 
Parents and Government have a duty to do everything we can to protect children from the ravages of illegal drugs and the crimes spawned by the drug trade. Up until now--I think we ought to be frank with each other and acknowledge that we have failed miserably. It is not enough to prohibit students from taking guns to school if we do not address the reasons why they do so. 
Mr. President, Congress addressed the issue of school violence in 1994 with the passage of the Gun-Free Schools Act, which required States to adopt a law mandating the expulsion of any student who brings a gun to school. 
During debate on that bill, it was argued that we should 
state, as a matter of policy, that children should not bring guns to school. In my opinion, the Senate should also state, as a matter of policy, that drugs have no place in school. That is why I am offering today S. 763, a bill which I believe to be a logical and commonsense extension of the 1994 law. 
Like that act, the bill sponsored by myself and several other Senators conditions the receipt of Federal education dollars, that is to say, Federal funds, on a State's adoption of a policy requiring the expulsion, for not less than one year, of any student who brings illegal drugs to school. Now, like the Gun-Free Schools Act, this bill does not create a new criminal offense, but it does require schools to refer violators to proper law enforcement authorities. 
Both the 1994 act and the bill I am introducing today are flexible. Each bill allows the chief administrative officer of a school district to grant an exemption on a case-by-case basis, and permits, but does not require, school districts to establish alternative education facilities for violators. 
So I think the policy is firm, yet fair. The drug trade and the violence associated with it have no place in America's classrooms. Schools should provide an environment that is conducive to learning and supportive of the vast majority of students who are in school to learn. Children and teachers alike deserve a school free of the fear and violence caused by drugs. 
Mr. President, on the issue of drugs, many speeches have been made citing respected authorities and a lot of impressive statistics as I have done today. However, nothing any Senator has said on this floor speaks quite as eloquently of our responsibilities as the statement of one of the students involved in the Research Triangle Institute study who said--and get this, I say to the Chair and other Senators--this student said, `I don't like how dangerous it is at this school. I just wish the teachers and the rest of the school staff would have better control over their students and keep kids like me safe.' 
Isn't it time for us to give the teachers and school administrators the support they need to remove violence and drug offenders from our schools? I think the answer to that is obvious. 
Therefore, Mr. President, the removal of drugs and violence from our schools surely are goals that everybody agrees with. The President, during his State of the Union Address, said that `we must continue to promote order and discipline' in America's schools by, as he put it, `remov[ing] disruptive students from the classroom, and hav[ing] zero tolerance for guns and drugs in school.' 
Obviously, I think the President was right on that one. I do not always agree with him, but you can't get any clearer than that. I commend him for that statement, and I hope he will support this effort by several of us who are concerned about the safety of our youngsters. I believe that working together, we can eliminate illegal drugs and illegal drug paraphernalia from America's classrooms.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, there are many times when I am so inclined to pay my respects to Senators who have gone out of their way to take a somewhat different stand. And I imagine that during the past week--and throughout the days of debate on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in the 104th Congress, as a matter of fact--that if unborn children had a vote or a message of communication and a way to deliver it, they would be sending their love to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum; and to the distinguished occupant of the chair, Mr. DeWine of Ohio; and to the able Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith as well as to the able Senators from Texas and Tennessee, Mr. Gramm and Mr. Frist; and on and on. 
It has not always been easy to take the pro-life position on this floor, but it is a lot easier and a lot more comfortable now, thanks to these great Senators and others. I personally pay my respects to all who have participated in the debate on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act up to this point. 
By the way, as one who has participated in the abortion debates since the Supreme Court's Roe versus Wade decision in 1973, and as one who has been condemned by many in certain quarters, I am so thankful that the cavalry has arrived in the Senate and now other Senators are standing up to be counted on an issue that involves the survival of this country. I have long felt if our country cannot reconcile with morality and decency and honesty, the position on the deliberate destruction of the most innocent, the most helpless of human life, that may be at peril--lying just down the road--is the survival of this country. 
In any case, the abortion debate shifted dramatically when legislation was introduced in the 104th Congress to spare unborn babies from a merciless procedure known as a partial-birth abortion. Because of the debate in Congress and the heightened concern of the American people, the spotlight no longer is focused on the sanctimonious, so-called right to choose; instead, the debate now centers around the ultimate question: Does an innocent, defenseless, unborn child have a right to live? Senators have cast their votes for and against legislation outlawing partial-birth abortions on two previous occasions--first on December 6, 1995, when 54 Senators voted to ban partial-birth abortions. But the President of the United States, Mr. Clinton, saw fit to veto that bill. The Senate, on September 26 of last year, failed to override that Presidential veto. Fifty-seven Senators voted to override, but the 57 were 10 votes fewer than the two-thirds necessary and required to override. 
Which brings me to where we are now and the reason I stand here to pay my respects to Senators like the distinguished occupant of the chair, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Smith, and others. The Senate has been considering whether an innocent baby--partially born, just 3 inches from the protection of the law--deserves the right to live, to love, and to be loved. Interestingly enough, the House of Representatives has already passed H.R. 1122, which is the bill now before the Senate. In my judgment, the Senate must not squander this opportunity to outlaw partial-birth abortions, and I cannot believe it will. 
Those who oppose the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, as it is named, have again asserted the necessity of the procedure that enables doctors to deliver babies partially, feet first from the womb, only to have their brains brutally removed by the doctor's instruments. This procedure has prompted revulsion across this land, even among many who previously have been vocal advocates of the right to choose. 
Well-known medical doctors, obstetricians and gynecologists have repeatedly rejected the assertions that a partial-birth abortion is needed to protect the health of a woman in a 
late-term complicated pregnancy. Dr. Pamela E. Smith, who is director of medical education in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Chicago's Mount Sinai Hospital, in a letter to Senators described these assertions as--in her words, not mine--`deceptive and patently untrue.' 
Also, Mr. President, there is much to be said about the facts surrounding the number of partial-birth abortions performed annually and the reason they are performed--or at least the given, stated reason. It is hard to overlook the recent confession of Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, who admitted that he, himself, had deceived the American people on national television about the number and the nature of partial-birth abortions. 
Mr. Fitzsimmons now estimates that up to 5,000 partial-birth abortions are conducted annually on healthy women carrying healthy babies. This is a far cry from the rhetoric espoused by Washington's pro-abortion groups who maintain that only 500 partial-birth abortions are performed every year, and only in extreme medical circumstances. 
Mr. President, I could go on and on, but Senators throughout this debate have provided ample evidence affirming the need to rid America of this senseless, brutal form of killing. And it is also important to note that the American people recognize the moral significance of this legislation. The continued outpouring of letters and phone calls from across the country in support of a ban on partial-birth abortions has been nothing short of remarkable. 
I remember so vividly the day in January 1973, when the Supreme Court handed down the decision to legalize abortion. It was hard to find many people to speak up, certainly on the floor of the Senate, on behalf of unborn babies. 
But it is time, once again, for Members of the Senate to stand up and be counted for or against the most helpless human beings imaginable, for or against the destruction of innocent human life in such a repugnant way. The Senate simply must pass the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, and I pray that it will do it by a margin of at least 67 votes in favor of the ban.

Mr. HELMS. Very well. I do thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require. 
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee this past Thursday reported a treaty to amend the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty. The vote was unanimous. 
I have never hesitated to oppose, or seek to modify, treaties that ignore the best interests of the American people. As long as I am a Member of the U.S. Senate, I will be mindful of the advice and consent responsibilities conferred upon the Senate and the Senators by the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, I have never hesitated to oppose bad treaties and bad resolutions of ratification without hesitation. But when a treaty serves the Nation's interests, if it is verifiable, and if the resolution of ratification ensures the integrity of these two points for the life of the treaty, I unfailingly offer my support to it. That is why I support the treaty before us today. 
In that connection, let the record show that the pending treaty was signed on May 31, 1996, and was not submitted by the President to the Senate for our advice and consent April 7, 1997. With the bewildering delay in the delivery of this treaty, the administration demanded action by May 15, 1997, which is tomorrow. 
So, after wasting an entire year, the administration demanded that the Senate act on this treaty within 1 month's time. I believe it is obvious that the Foreign Relations Committee has been more than helpful in fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities to advise and consent. 
The treaty before us today is a modification of the treaty approved by the Senate in 1991. Specifically, it will revise the obligations of Ukraine and Russia in what is known as the flank zone of the former Soviet Union. In recognition of the changes having occurred since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the 30 parties to the CFE Treaty have agreed to modify the obligations of Ukraine and Russia. 
The 1991 CFE Treaty could not and did not anticipate the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, let alone the expansion of NATO to include Central and Eastern Europe countries. Consequently, recent years have been occupied with efforts to adapt the treaty to the new security environment of its members. 
Mr. President, in its essentials, the Flank Agreement removes several administrative districts from the old flank zone, thus permitting current flank equipment ceilings to apply to a smaller area. In addition, Russia now has until May 1999 to reduce its forces sufficient to meet the new limit. 
To provide some counterbalance to these adjustments, reporting requirements were enhanced and inspection rights in the zone increased. 
Mr. President, with the protections, interpretations, and monitoring requirements contained in the resolution of ratification, I recommend approval of this treaty because it sets reasonable limits and provides adequate guarantees to ensure implementation. 
However, the simple act of approving this treaty does not diminish the need for further steps by the U.S. Government to strengthen the security of those countries located on Russia's borders. If this agreement is not implemented properly, Russia will retain its existing military means to intimidate its neighbors--a pattern of behavior with stark precedents. 
As the Clinton administration is so fond of saying, this treaty is but a tool to implement the foreign policy of the United States. During the past 4 years, the Clinton administration has remained silent while Russia has encroached upon the territory and sovereignty of its neighbors. It was the lack of a foreign policy--not a lack of tools--that allowed this to happen. 
I have confidence that the new Secretary of State will correct the course of our policies toward Russia, and I gladly support this treaty to aid the Honorable Madeleine Albright in that endeavor. The collapse of the Soviet Union was one of the finest moments of the 20th century. To allow even a partial restoration of the Soviet Union before the turn of the century would be a failure of an even greater magnitude. 
Mr. President, a final and related issue in the resolution of ratification is one upholding the prerogatives of the Senate in matters related to the ABM Treaty. During the past few years, the executive branch has sought to erode the Senate's constitutional role of advice and consent regarding treaties. In fact, the executive branch originally refused to submit for advice and consent the treaty that is before the Senate today. Through protracted negotiations, the Senate successfully asserted its proper role to advise and consent to new, international treaty obligations. Likewise, on revisions to the ABM Treaty, it is only through a legally binding mandate that we can ensure the proper, constitutional role of the U.S. Senate. I hope, Mr. President, that we can proceed to do that without delay. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the resolution of ratification.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the comments by the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee. I must say for the record that I also enjoy the privilege of working with him. I think the committee has been more active in the last year or two than it has been for some time. But in any case, I am grateful to Senator Biden. 
Mr. President, the history of the succession agreements to the various treaties concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union further supports the case for Senate consideration of ABM multilateralization. In only one case was advice and consent not required for multilateralization on an arms control treaty. Because the INF Treaty carried the so-called negative obligation of not possessing any intermediate-range nuclear missiles, that treaty could be multilateralized without altering any treaty terms or imposing any new treaty rights or obligations on the United States or new parties. 
Multilateralization of the START I Treaty under the Lisbon Protocol, on the other hand, required Senate advice and consent because this change had clear implications for the treaty's text and object and purpose. The Lisbon Protocol determined the extent to which countries other than Russia would be allowed to possess strategic nuclear weapons. Similarly, ratification of the Lisbon Protocol also effectively determined successorship questions to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT. Under that protocol, Belarus and other countries agreed to a legally binding commitment to join the NPT as nonnuclear weapons states. Thus when the Senate offered its advice and consent to the Lisbon Protocol, it approved successorship to both the INF and the START treaties. 
Finally, the Senate specifically considered the question of multilateralization of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe under condition 5 of the resolution of ratification for the CFE Treaty. 
Under article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution, the Senate holds a co-equal treaty-making power. John Jay made one of the most cogent arguments in this respect, noting:  
Of course, treaties could be amended, but let us not forget that treaties are made not only by one of the contracting parties, but by both, and consequently that as the consent of both was essential to their formation at first, so must it ever afterwards be in order to alter . . . them. 
Now, my colleagues of the Senate may disagree on the wisdom of continuing the national strategy embodied in the ABM Treaty. Where I hope all of our colleagues could agree, however, is on the imperative of upholding the constitutional responsibilities of the Senate, as reposed in this body by the Founding Fathers. 
Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated: 
The accretion of dangerous power does not come in a day. It does come, however, slowly, from the generative force of unchecked disregard of the restrictions that fence in even the most disinterested assertion of authority. 
I know the administration has demonstrated nothing if not disregard for the Senate's constitutional authority. The Senate's duty with regard to the issue of ABM multilateralization is, I believe, Mr. President, clear. 
I yield the floor. 
How much time does the distinguished Senator from Texas want?

Mr. HELMS. You have done it correctly, I say to the Senator. 
Conditions 1, 2, and 3 of the resolution on ratification require the President to observe reasonable limits in the conduct of certain negotiations facilitated by the United States in support of the CFE Treaty. Specifically, this entails an obligation for the President to conduct his diplomacy in a manner that respects the sovereignty and free will of countries on the periphery of Russia that are under pressure by Russia to allow the establishment of military bases. 
In fact, I do not believe that the United States should be party to any negotiation which could result in allowing Russia to deploy its troops into the territory occupied by the Soviet Union for nearly 70 years. Yet this is exactly the result contemplated by the Clinton administration if this resolution of ratification is not clear on this point. Conditions 1, 2, and 3 are clear on this matter. 
It is clear from this document that the Clinton administration has demonstrated a willingness to participate in negotiations that could actually result in the establishment of Russian military bases on the territory of other States with the endorsement--and even with the active assistance--of the United States. Is there anyone in the administration who is prepared to state that it would be in the United States' interest for Russia to establish military bases outside of its territory? 
The Clinton administration offers hollow assertions that Russian troops will not be deployed in other States without the freely given consent of the relevant government. Russia--still the largest military power in Europe--has used its armed forces in recent years in both Georgia and Azerbaijan with virtually no complaint from the Clinton administration. 
Russia uses its military presence in Ukraine and Moldova to influence the sovereign governments of those States while the Clinton administration remains silent. Russian Government officials have made open threats of military invasion against the Baltic States. Finally, less than 1 year ago, a bloody war in Chechnya was brought to an end. That war was characterized by wide scale Russian atrocities, the intentional targeting of civilians, and casualties possibly in excess of 100,000 people--mostly innocent men, women, and children. Do the administration's lawyers find that these incidents were with the freely given consent of the affected governments? 
Conditions 1, 2, and 3 set reasonable limits specifically tied to activities cited in paragraph IV (2) and (3) of the CFE Flank Document.

During the past 4 years, the Clinton administration has remained silent while Russia has encroached upon the territory and sovereignty of its neighbors. It was the lack of a foreign policy--not a lack of tools--that allowed this to happen. 
I have confidence that the new Secretary of State will correct the course of our policies toward Russia, and I gladly support this treaty to aid the Honorable Madeleine Albright in that endeavor. The collapse of the Soviet Union was one of the finest moments of the 20th century. To allow even a partial restoration of the Soviet Union before the turn of the century would be a failure of an even greater magnitude. 
Senator Lott, I believe, is standing by. 
I thank the Senator.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending May 9, the United States imported 7,566,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,057,000 barrels less than the 8,623,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
While this is one of the few weeks that Americans imported less oil than the same week a year ago, Americans still relied on foreign oil for 53.9 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by U.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 7,566,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Wei is China's most prominent dissident. Perhaps I should say that he is China's most prominent dissident in jail. In any event, there are no active dissidents in China, according to this year's State Department human rights report--they are all in jail, or silent. 
Wei became famous for his powerful, articulate statements during the Democracy Wall movement. After his release in 1993, he returned his advocacy of democratic reform. After 6 months, he was rearrested and held incommunicado for almost 2 years before being sentenced to another 14-year prison term in 1996. 
Wei shows no concern for himself. His health is poor, threatened by heart problems. Yet he continues to stand up to the Chinese Government, demanding freedom and democracy for the people of China. 
Wei's letters reveal courage in the face of a brutal and immoral regime. His example is bound to humble any one who dares take for granted the freedoms enjoyed by the American people. 
I hope that, somehow, Wei will learn of the enormous respect and support he has from the American people. I urge Senators to join in calling upon the Chinese Government to release Wei and immediately provide him with the medical treatment he so badly needs.

Mr. HELMS. I am pleased to join Senator Moynihan today in introducing a bill that would for the first time place in statute the Government system for the classification of information. To date this has been accomplished solely through Executive order. 
The statute is based on the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission to Protect and Reduce Government Secrecy chaired by my colleague Pat Moynihan, the senior Senator from New York. The Secrecy Commission achieved a unified report of recommendations--a feat that should not be underrated, especially in Washington. 
The Commission, by law, had the twin goals of studying how to protect important Government secrets and simultaneously reducing the amount of classified documents and materials. All Commissioners began their deliberations with the premise that Government secrecy is a form of regulation that, like all regulations, should be used sparingly, and certainly never for the goal of keeping the truth from the American people. Commissioners also began the process recognizing that over-classification can actually weaken the protections of those secrets that truly are in our national interest. 
All the same I am obliged to begin with a reiteration of the obvious--that the protection of true national security information remains vital to the well-being and security of the United States. The end of the cold war notwithstanding, the United States continues to face serious and long-term threats from a variety of fronts. While Communist and anti-American regimes, such as North Korea, Cuba, Iran, and Iraq, continue to wage a war of espionage against the United States, new threats have arisen as well. 
Most alarming, perhaps, is the growing trend of espionage conducted not by our enemies but by American allies. Such espionage is on the rise especially against U.S. economic secrets. According to a February 1996 report by GAO, classified military information and sensitive military technologies are high priority targets for the intelligence agencies of U.S. allies. 
At first blush, a push to reduce Government secrecy may seem at odds with these increasing threats. I am convinced it is not. The sheer volume of government secrets--and their cost to the taxpayers and U.S. business--is staggering. In 1996 the taxpayers spent more than $5.2 billion to protect classified information. We know all too well from our own experiences that when everything is secret nothing is secret. 
Secrecy all too often then becomes a political tool used by executive branch agencies to shield information which may be politically sensitive or policies which may be unpopular with the American public. Worse yet, information may be classified to hide from public view illegal or unethical activity. On numerous occasions I, and other Members of Congress, have found the executive branch to be reluctant to share certain information, the nature of which is not truly a national secret, but which would be potentially politically embarrassing to officials in the 
executive branch or which would make known an illegal or indefensible policy. 
I have also found that one of the largest impediments to openness is the perverse incentives of the Government bureaucracy itself in favor of classification, and the lack of accountability for those who do the actual classification. I strongly endorse the Commission's recommendation of adding individual accountability to the process by requiring original and derivative classifiers to actually identify themselves and include within the documents a justification of the decision to classify. 
The only way to change a bureaucracy is to reverse the incentive to classify. A good example of how to change this lack of bureaucratic accountability is a provision contained in H.R. 3121--legislation which we approved in the Foreign Relations Committee last year that was signed into law. Previously, details on U.S. commercial arms sales to foreign governments were not made available to the public unless a citizen requested that the State Department make it public. The incentive therefore was to keep the information closely regulated. H.R. 3121 provides that all arm sales will be made public unless the President determines that the release of the information is contrary to U.S. national security interest. Although this may appear to be a small nuance, the bureaucratic incentive is changed enormously to favor openness. Shifting the burden in this way can introduce more openness into the system and force the bureaucracy to identify true national security threats. 
I am convinced, however, that the single most important recommendation of our Commission that Congress should focus on is the concept of creating a life cycle for secrets. This means that all information, classified and unclassified alike, has a life span in which decisions must be made regarding creation, management, and use. This kind of rationalization would shift the burden to favor openness and reduce some of the costs associated with declassification. 
I would add a note of caution to the Commission's work on declassification, however. In the course of the 2 years of its work, the Commission became very interested in the declassification of existing documents and materials. In a perfect world, if information remains relevant to true U.S. national interests it should remain classified indefinitely. Information that does not compromise U.S. interests and sources should be made public. We all realize, however, that this is a tremendously costly venture. In fact, the Commission was unable to come up with solid data on the true cost of declassification. 
In this era when Congress has finally begun to grasp the essential need to reduce Government spending and balance the budget, the issue of balancing costs and benefits is an essential one. The financial costs to the American taxpayers must be balanced against the necessity of the declassification. The real lesson to take from the work of this Commission is the need to redress for the future the problems of over classification and a systematic process for declassification, so that the costs and timeliness of declassification does not pose the same economic and regulatory burdens on future generations. At the same time, it may be too costly to declassify all of the countless classified documents now in existence. 
With this caveat in mind, I hope the Congress will focus on bringing government-wide rationalization to the classification process. It is an area where tough congressional oversight is long overdue.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I certainly am not alone in having strong feelings that the senior citizens of America must not be deprived of their right to choose their own doctors. 
Senator Grassley's Medicare Patient Choice and Access Act of 1997, which I'm cosponsoring today, ensures choice, access, and quality care for senior citizens by guaranteeing enrollees the option of choosing a point-of-service plan at the time they enroll in a Medicare HMO. 
Five years ago, I had a close but fortunate encounter with some remarkable medical doctors in my home town of Raleigh. My heart surgery and the very effective subsequent rehabilitation made it clear that I had been cared for by some of the most capable people in the medical profession. 
I was free to choose the surgeon who performed the operation. Senior citizens enrolled in Medicare should have the same choice, and the bill I'm co-sponsoring today will enable senior citizens who join HMO's to preserve their right to choose their doctor. 
America's senior citizens depend on the health care coverage provided by the Medicare system, and those of us in Congress have a duty to make sure they will not be forced to give up their right to choose their doctors. 
Mr. President, the Health Care Financing Administration--which, of course, administers Medicare--is now the largest purchaser of managed care in the Nation, accounting for about 18 million Americans. As of February 1997, 5 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in managed care plans. This represents a 108-percent increase in managed care enrollment since 1993. Increased migration of the elderly into health maintenance organizations, and other types of managed care plans, will surely lower the costs of operating the vast Medicare system. And citizens who belong to a Medicare-supported HMO may increase their benefits for prescription drugs, eyeglasses, and hearing aids coverage not available through fee-for-service plans. 
Without some moderating legislation, however, senior citizens could very well find themselves locked into coverage that limits them to services provided by HMO-affiliated doctors, other professionals and hospitals. No longer would senior citizens have the freedom to choose their own doctor. 
Mr. President, consider, if you will, the predicament of a patient who requires heart surgery, and whose HMO will not approve the cardiologist with whom the senior has built up a longstanding relationship. Should that patient be required to wait for a year's time to change to a plan that will cover the cardiologist whom the patient knows and trusts? 
We must provide a safety valve to protect seniors who find themselves in that position. A point-of-service option would enable patients to see physicians and specialists inside and outside the managed care network. If senior citizens are satisfied with the care they receive within the 
network, they will feel no need to choose outside doctors and specialists. Without such options, however, these senior citizens will be locked into a rigid system which may, or may not, give them the health care they need from people they most trust to provide it. 
Mr. President, most Americans, whether their health is insured by private firms or by Medicare, enjoy their freedom to decide which medical professional will provide their care and treatment. According to polls I have seen, patients are willing to pay a little more for the ability to go out of network to be assured of seeing the doctors of their choice. As many as 70 percent of Americans over 50 years old declared in one poll that they would be unwilling to join a Medicare managed plan that denied them the freedom to choose their own physicians. 
Building a point-of-service option into all health plans under Medicare will not interfere with the plan's ability to contain cost, nor will it limit their efforts to encourage providers and patients to use their health care resources wisely. It simply will ensure that health plans put the patient first. 
The CBO indicated that a built-in point-of-service feature would not increase the cost of Medicare. In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, CBO stated that:  
the point of service option would permit Medicare enrollees to go to providers outside the HMO's panel when they wanted to, and yet it need not increase the benefit cost to HMO's or to Medicare * * * 
The Medicare Patient Choice and Access Act also includes patient protections and provisions ensuring Medicare participants' timely access to specialists and provides an expedited appeals process which requires patient grievances to be resolved within 30 days. Lastly, this bill expands the consumer information which must be provided to beneficiaries to help patients compare health plans. Unfortunately, although the Health Care Financing Administration collect vast amounts of data, virtually none of it is currently accessible to consumers. 
So, Mr. President, I urge Senators to support the Medicare Patient Choice and Access Act, which will provide senior citizens with real patient protections and real choice in health care.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending April 25, the U.S. imported 7,983,000 barrels of oil each day, 69,000 barrels less than the 8,052,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
While this is one of the few weeks that Americans imported less oil than the same week a year ago, Americans still relied on foreign oil for 55.5 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by U.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 7,983,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, there is a lot of misunderstanding about this treaty. It has been advertised implicitly--not explicitly, of course--as a cure-all; as an end to the perils of chemical warfare. And a lot of people think it will all be over, and we will not have any more danger. The truth of the matter is that they will not do a thing in the world to help the situation because the Chemical Weapons treaty--Convention, as it has been called--is not a comprehensive ban. This treaty contributes to the national security of the United States and the American people, and that is what I am primarily interested in. 
This treaty, it seems to me, must at a minimum affect those countries possessing chemical weapons which pose a threat to the United States. Accordingly, the United States should not become a party to this treaty--many Senators feel--until those countries are also participants. And no effort has been made to encourage them to come in. We are standing alone, and they are going to go about their little deviltry unmolested. Rogue states--like Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and North Korea--clearly represent a threat to United States security and the security of key United States allies. And not one of these countries has ratified the CWC, and not one of them is likely to ratify. 
First, the intelligence people in our own country--we call it the intelligence community--reported that all of these governments have active aggressive programs to develop and produce chemical weapons. 
In March 1995, I believe it was, regarding the nonproliferation treaty, the Central Intelligence Agency released an unclassified estimate that gave a troubling assessment of the likely impact that the CWC would have upon the proliferation of chemical weapons. 
This report said: 
A number of states continue to pursue the development or enhancement of a chemical weapons capability. Some states have chosen to pursue a chemical weapons capability because of relatively low cost, and the low technology required for chemical weapons production. Moreover, they believe that a CWC ability can serve as both a deterrent to enemy attack and as an enhancement of their offensive military capability. 
I am quoting. The report says: 
Currently, at least 15 countries have an offensive CWC program in some level of development, and the most aggressive chemical weapons programs are in Iran, Libya, and Syria. The CWC will continue to be a serious threat for at least the remainder of this decade despite a number of armaments control efforts, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention. Several countries have expressed concern, excluding Libya, Syria and Iraq, which have so far refused to sign the CWC, and some CW-capable countries that have signed the treaty show no signs of ending their programs. 
That was our intelligence community's assessment of the situation as of 1995. 
Mr. President, while the intent of the CWC is good, what it proposes is to create a global chemical weapons ban, and it will not do any such thing. It simply will not achieve any other of the goals. Thirty percent of the countries with chemical weapons programs, including all of those with what is called aggressive programs, have not yet signed the treaty, let alone ratified it. Yet, these countries have been and will continue to be the paramount chemical weapons threat to the United States. 
About 6 years ago, during Operation Desert Storm, the United States was so concerned about Iraq's chemical weapons program that we focused a huge percentage of long allied air attacks upon Saddam Hussein's chemical weaponry. A facility 65 miles north of Baghdad was the nucleus of Iraq's chemical weapons program, and a priority target during the early days of the gulf war. I was amazed then that no one seemed to pay much attention. And I am amazed now that no one seems to remember General Schwarzkopf's remarks during a press briefing at that time in Saudi Arabia. 
It was on February 27, 1991. Here is what he said:  
The nightmare scenario for all of us would have been to go through the Iraqi tank barrier, get hung up in this breach right here and then have the enemy artillery rain chemical weapons on the troops that were in the gaggle, in the breach right here. 
Pointing to specific points. 
Well, the point is this. That nightmare scenario exists today since Iraq has neither signed nor ratified this treaty. 
Let us look at another rogue regime, North Korea. On March 18, 1996, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Patrick Hughes, forwarded to me a DIA assessment of North Korea's military capabilities which underscored United States concern with the war-fighting uses to which chemical weapons can be put. 
Now, according to that study, and I am quoting, `In any attack on the South, P'yongyang could use chemical weapons to attack forces deployed near the DMZ, suppress allied air power and isolate the peninsula from strategic reinforcements.' 
Now, in boasting that this treaty will make American soldiers free from the threat of chemical weapons, the administration either has forgotten or deliberately ignored the fact that North Korea has neither signed nor ratified the CWC and the threat posed by North Korea and Iraq and others here. Now over 30,000 United States troops face North Korean troops armed and extensively trained with chemical weapons. Key airfields and ports are within striking distance of North Korean missiles, and with just a handful of chemical weapons North Korea could force United States aircraft to withdraw from the Korean Peninsula to Japan, and in fact in the near future North Korea may be even able to strike air bases in Japan with chemical munitions. Without air support and reinforcement, our ground forces and our South Korean allies would be overwhelmed within days. 
The threat to the United States forces in the Persian Gulf being rotated from Iran and Iraq is no less troubling, Mr. President. The bottom line, I guess, is that rogue states--if you will look at the chart--see chemical weapons as the best means to offset the superior conventional forces of the United States and its allies. These countries continue to develop plans to use chemical weapons in the event of war, and we must remember I think, Mr. President, that each of these countries are state sponsors, Government sponsors, of terrorism and may supply chemical weapons to terrorist groups. 
So when the CWC enters into force, our troops will be no safer from chemical attacks than they are today because the countries of greatest concern have not acceded to this treaty. For the CWC to offer any improvement, however modest, to the national security of the United States, it must at a minimum, I think, affect those countries with aggressive chemical weapons programs, those countries which have hostile intentions toward the United States and the American people. 
I urge Senators, please, to oppose this motion to strike this key provision.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, before I plead on this amendment, I have been around this place for quite a while. Before I came to the Senate as a Senator, I had the honor of serving with two Senators as administrative assistant. Time after time, at the conclusion of long arduous debate and votes on various issues, a parting `thank you' is made to the staff people who did most of the work. I talked to Senator Biden and told him I want to do it now before we begin to sign off. He suggested that I go first. 
Admiral Nance, sitting back there, with the white hair, that young man, he and I were boyhood friends back in Monroe. Adm. James W. Nance, the chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee; Tom Klein; Mark Theissen; Steve Biegun; Marshall Billingslea--particularly Marshall Billingslea--Colleen Noonan; Beth Wilson, and the rest of the Foreign Relations Committee staff. 
Senator Kyl has three remarkable young people: David Stephens, John Rood, and Jeanine Esperne. Senator Craig has Yvonne Bartoli and Jim Jatras. 
I want to thank, in particular, some people from the outside who helped enormously in our trying to build a case to protect the American people from the extravagances of this treaty. But that is neither here nor there, but I want to thank those four great former Secretaries of Defense who came up--Dick Cheney; Cap Weinberger; Don Rumsfeld; James Schlesinger; the marvelous Jeane Kirkpatrick; Steve Forbes, who came down from New York; Richard Perle; Frank Gaffney; Doug Feith, and Fred Clay. I also want to include the retired flag and general officers. 
I know that when I am driving home in a few hours from now, I will think of others. Just speaking for all of us, I want to thank them all. I know Senator Biden wants to do the same thing on his side. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator. I will add two things. One, I hope Bob Dole stays out of those coffee shops from now on. I am going to see if the distinguished ranking member would mention probably the most prominent player in this game. He didn't, but I will, because I had the honor of escorting her to North Carolina--the new Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright. I don't always agree with her, nor she with me. But she is a great lady and she is doing a good job for this country. I thank her. 
Mr. President, one of the many fine people who contributed to the Chemical Weapons Convention is no longer among us. Mrs. Sherry Stetson Mannix, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, joined the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in 1984 and became its top expert on chemical weapons. She helped negotiate the treaty, and then she became a resource person for Members and staff of the Senate as we began to consider whether to give our advice and consent to ratification. 
Lieutenant Colonel Mannix was dying of cancer in 1994, when the Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees first held hearings on the CWC. Despite being in terrible pain, Lieutenant Colonel Mannix faithfully and effectively managed the process of responding to our committees' questions for the Record. 
Sherry Mannix was only 44 years old when she died in early 1995. She had hoped to live long enough to see this convention ratified. We were unable, Mr. President, to grant that last wish. But Sherry Mannix kept faith with us, with her comrades in the U.S. Armed Forces, and with her country. Now we have the opportunity to keep faith with her, and with all our military personnel who long for ratification of this convention as a step toward curbing the menace of chemical weapons.

Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I am going to abbreviate my statement in the interest of time, hoping that we can help Senators get out a little bit earlier, including the distinguished occupant of the Chair. 
Mr. President, this condition is very important. It forbids the deposit of the United States instrument of ratification until Russia has made significant progress in implementing the 1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement and has resolved concerns over its incomplete data declarations under the Wyoming memorandum of understanding, ratified the convention and has committed to forgo the clandestine maintenance of chemical weapons production capability. 
That sounds like a lot but more than anything else it is a measurement of how Russia is playing games in terms of not doing things to live up to its agreement. 
I have the highest hope that Russia one day will have a free enterprise economy and all the rest of it, but such commitments by Russia are absolutely imperative and essential to the success of this CWC, this treaty, in securing a truly global ban on possession and use of chemical weapons. If Russia continues to drag its feet, this convention will be worth almost nothing. And for my part, as one Senator, I am extremely concerned that Russia, the country that possesses the largest and the most sophisticated chemical weapons arsenal in the world, has refused consistently to agree to implement its commitments to eliminate its chemical weapons stockpile despite the 1990 United States-Russian Bilateral Destruction Agreement. 
Now, put any face on it you want, but if Russia fails to do that, then Russia is telling this Senate, this Government, the American people, we don't care what you want; we are going our way. And that is a pretty dangerous position for Russia to take in terms of world peace. 
This coupled with the Russian withdrawal from the BDA and the Russian Parliament rejection of the chemical weapons destruction plan portend ominous things to come in terms of Russia's ratification of this treaty. 
Now, I hope Senators are aware, and if they are not aware, that they will become aware, that Russia is by far and away the world's largest possessor of chemical weapons. If the United States in eliminating its own chemical stockpile could assure that Russia also destroyed its stockpile through the Bilateral Destruction Agreement, 99 percent of the world's chemical arsenal would be eliminated independently of this treaty. So that gives you some idea of the enormity of this situation which has been passed over and over and over. I think enough is enough. 
Now, of course, Russia has signed the CWC but it has not ratified this treaty. Evidence has come to light recently, by the way, suggesting that Russia may not pursue ratification of this treaty in the near term and does not intend to abide by the CWC even if it ratifies it. 
I just want Senators to understand what they are doing. It is all very well and good to succumb to the imaginative suggestion that we are doing something about chemical weapons when we pass this treaty. We are not. It is not going to do one bit of good until the United States is able to persuade some other people to do things that they have already agreed to do. So the danger is how the American people are being misled by those who have endorsed this treaty into believing that something is being done about chemical weaponry. 
I hope, if we do nothing else in our opposition to this treaty, we can make the American people aware that nothing is being done for their safety by this treaty. I wish it were different. I wish I did not have to stand here and say this. But those are the facts. This treaty is absolutely useless in terms of giving the American people any security at all. 
According to a May 6, 1996, letter from the DIA, the Defense 
Intelligence Agency, to the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence:  
There are several factors affecting Russia's actions regarding its CW programs and arms control commitments. Russian officials probably believe they need a CW capability to deter other nations from chemical warfare. They cite a potential threat from purported CW programs in the United States, other Western nations, and several countries on or near Russia's borders. 
Now, the DIA continued: 
In addition, Russian officials believe that dismantling the CW program would waste resources and rob them of valuable production assets. They maintain that the CW production facilities should not be destroyed but be used to produce commercial products. 
Well, la-de-da. Every nation that has some ulterior motives with chemical weapons can say the same thing. 
Moreover, these officials do not want to see their life's work destroyed, their jobs eliminated, and their influence diminished. 
And here we are probably going to ratify this treaty in spite of the great concern about the views of Russia's senior military leadership on the Chemical Weapons Convention and on the elimination of Russia's chemical warfare capability in general. 
On numerous instances, the United States has received indications that key elements within the Russian Government staunchly oppose the CWC. Back in 1994, October 25, Dr. Lev Fyodorov--I never met him, do not know how to pronounce his name--head of the Union for Chemical Security, told Interfax news service that key officers from the Russian Ministry of Defense had spoken against the treaty during the Russian Duma defense committee's closed hearings on October 11 1994.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we are all aware of how the administration has refused, refused to provide the Senate, despite my repeated requests, my repeated entreaties to them, to give us an updated assessment of the Russian position regarding the BDA and the CWC. 
Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin wrote to Vice President Gore on July 8, 1996 stating that both the BDA and the 1989 Wyoming memorandum of understanding have outlived their usefulness to Russia, don't you see. Moreover, the Prime Minister, one, tied Russian ratification of this treaty, the CWC, to United States agreement to a joint statement linking ratification by the United States to Russian ratification; two, stated that the American taxpayers--get this--the American taxpayers must pay the cost of the Russian destruction program; and three, he linked ratification to United States acquiescence to Russia's position on conversion of its chemical weapons facilities. The shift in Russian arms control policy, you see, will have important ramifications. 
First, the minimalist approaches taken by Russia in its data declaration on the Wyoming memorandum of understanding will go unresolved. Russia has stated that the total size of its stockpiled chemical weapons is equivalent to 40,000 tons of agent. This declaration is absolutely untrue. The Director of Central Intelligence, James Woolsey, testified before the Foreign Relations Committee on June 23, 1994, that the United States had `serious concerns over apparent incompleteness, inconsistency and contradictory aspects of the data' submitted by Russia under the Wyoming MOU. On August 27, 1993, Adm. William Studeman, Acting Director of Central Intelligence, wrote to Senator Glenn stating: 
We cannot confirm that the Russian declaration of 40,000 mt is accurate. In addition, we cannot confirm that the total stockpile is stored only at the seven sites declared by the Soviets... 
Articles in both the Washington Post and the Washington Times alleged that the Defense Intelligence Agency has estimated the Soviet stockpile could be as large as 75,000 metric tons. 
Omissions in Russia's MOU data declarations have clear implications for how Russia will interpret the various provisions of the CWC. Because the BDA mandates annual updates to the Wyoming MOU, Russian withdrawal from the BDA may also signal that Russia will henceforth refuse to entertain any additional United States questions about the size of its chemical weapons stockpile or its binary weapons program. Senators should be concerned that Russia may intend to provide to the OPCW data which mirrors that provided under the Wyoming MOU. This would, in this Senator's view, serve as a clear indicator that Russia intends to violate the CWC. 
Second, Russia has consistently refused to provide information on the status of its binary chemical weapons program. On June 23, 1994, then-Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey declared that `the data we have received from Russia makes no reference to binary chemical weapons or agents. That is contrary to our understanding of the program that was initiated by the former Soviet Union.' 
Dr. Vil Mirzayanov, former chief of counterintelligence at the State Union Scientific Research Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology, has stated that the Russian Federation may continue work on novel nerve agents far more lethal than any other known chemical agents--substance A-230, substance 33, and substance A-232. In an article in the Wall Street Journal on May 25, 1994, Dr. Mirzayanov wrote: 
It is very easy to produce binary weapons without detection under the guise of agricultural petrochemicals. The products easily pass all safety tests and become registered with the government as legitimate commercial products. The plant receives a license for production and goes into operation. Neither the firm's leaders, its staff, nor international inspectors know that the chemicals are a component of a new binary weapon. 
As the public talks toward banning chemical weapons progressed, the more intense became Russia's secret development and testing of binary weapons... our laboratories created Substance A-230, a weapon about which I can only say that its killing efficiency surpassed any known military toxin by a factor of five to eight. 
...Two more major achievements took place in 1990 and 1991. First, a binary weapon based on a compound code-named Substance 33 passed site tests and was put into production for the Soviet army. 
...The second development was the synthesis of a binary weapon based on Substance A-232, a toxin similar to A-230. This new weapon, part of the ultra-lethal `Novichok' class, provides an opportunity for the military establishment to disguise production of components of binary weapons as common agricultural chemicals; because the West does not know the formula, and its inspectors cannot identify the compounds. 
...Fifteen thousand tons of Substance 33 have been produced in the city of Novocheborksarsk... But our generals have told the U.S. that Novocheborksarsk is turning out another substance known as VX. 
Dr. Mirzayanov and other dissident Russian scientists have claimed that Russia's binary weapons program has been specifically crafted to evade detection under the verification regime of the CWC. They allege that components for the binary agents have been given legitimate commercial applications, that they are not covered under the CWC's schedules, and that OPCW inspectors will not know what they are examining when they come across such chemicals. The United States should not ratify the CWC until Russia agrees to forgo this abhorrent program. 
Third, the BDA provides for United States on-site inspections of Russian storage, destruction and production facilities, combined with data declarations. The United States can expect to gain real monitoring benefits from the CWC only if the Bilateral Destruction Agreement [BDA] is implemented. This agreement provides for United States on-site inspections of Russian storage, destruction and production facilities. Without the BDA, the United States will be forced to verify Russian CWC compliance based upon a smaller number of inspections than anticipated under the bilateral arrangement, with inspections of Russian sites by the OPCW rather than by United States personnel, and with no guaranteed United States access to detailed inspection data. In other words, the intelligence community's already poor confidence level in its ability to monitor Russian treaty compliance will fall even lower. 
Fourth, Russian insistence on excluding several of its chemical weapons-related facilities from the BDA's definition of `chemical weapons production facility,' and hence from the CWC's definition, relates directly to its desire to maintain a clandestine chemical weapons production capability. The United States refusal to accede to the Russian position, which would have--in turn--strengthened the Russian case for facility conversions under the CWC, may be a primary reason that Russia has refused to implement the BDA. We should not, under any circumstance, allow Russia to exclude its chemical weapons facilities from inspection. 
Moreover, without the bilateral agreement the OPCW will increase the size of its international inspectorate and purchase of additional equipment. This will drive up vastly the expected costs of the regime. Further, the CWC requires States Parties to pay for monitoring of their chemical weapons production, storage, and disposal facilities. 
Mr. President, I guess we ought to respond once more--it is an exercise in futility, but we ought to keep responding to that old litany that we have heard this day about making the United States ratification of the CWC contingent upon Russia's acting first. 
Let us look at a little bit of history. This Senate approved the START II treaty amidst a clamor of claims by the administration that a failure to act was preventing Russian approval of that treaty. Does anybody hear anything familiar about that? More than 15 months have passed and the Russian Duma still has not approved START II. Instead, the Russian leadership rendered ratification of the START II treaty contingent upon United States acquiescence to Russian interpretation of, get this, the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and now the Chemical Weapons Convention is being tied to NATO enlargement and other issues. 
Mr. President, surely, surely, Senators will not fail to refuse such linkages, and the best way to do it is to require, to stipulate unmistakably that Russia must act in good faith and ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention first. Indeed, in his letter to Vice President Gore, the Prime Minister of Russia stated that the United States should wait for Russia. 
I urge Senators to reject that motion to strike. 
I yield the floor. I do not know who has been waiting the longest.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we all know full well that this administration has already testified that the CWC is `effectively verifiable.' The Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, John Holum, testified on March 22, 1994, that `the treaty is effectively verifiable' and that the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Walter Slocombe, made similar claims on May 13, 1994. However, just because administration officials have declared the CWC to be `effectively verifiable' does not make it so. 
Indeed, by making such claims the Clinton administration has done great violence to the standard of `effective verification' developed and refined by the Reagan and Bush administrations as a key criteria for arms control treaties. The definition of `effective verification' was first offered to the Foreign Relations Committee by Ambassador Paul Nitze during hearings on the INF Treaty in 1988 and subsequently further refined on January 24, 1989, by ACDA's Director, Maj. Gen. William Burns, and again in January 1992 by Secretary of State James Baker. The components of effective verification, as defined during testimony, are: (1) a `high level of assurance' in the intelligence community's ability to detect (2) a `militarily significant' violation in (3) a `timely fashion.' That definition is the one used in this condition. 
This yardstick of `effective verification' has been the standard against which every arms control treaty for the last decade has been measured. It should be the standard against which the CWC is measured as well. 
For any arms control treaty to be effective it must be verifiable. When Vice President George Bush put forward the first U.S.-sponsored text for the CWC, he told negotiators in Geneva on April 18, 1984, that: 
For a chemical weapons ban to work, each party must have confidence that the other parties are abiding by it. . . . No sensible government enters into those international contracts known as treaties unless it can ascertain--or verify--that it is getting what it contracted for. 
I could not agree more. 
In my view, this standard cannot be met by the CWC. On March 1, 1989, then-Director of Central Intelligence [DCI] William Webster stated that monitoring the CWC `is going to be costly and difficult, and, presently, the level of confidence is quite low.' On January 24, 1989, Director Burns noted that `verification of any chemical ban is going to be extremely difficult.' ACDA's section 37 report on the CWC, submitted on March 18, 1994, states 
that the CWC's verification provisions, together with National Technical Means [NTM], `are insufficient to detect, with a high degree of confidence, all activities prohibited under the Convention.' Then-DCI Woolsey testified on June 23, 1994 that `I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale.' 
Most significantly, declassified portions from the August 1993 NIE note: 
The capability of the intelligence community to monitor compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention is severely limited and likely to remain so for the rest of the decade. They key provision of the monitoring regime--challenge inspections at undeclared sites--can be thwarted by a nation determined to preserve a small, secret program using the delays and managed access rules allowed by the Convention. 
With respect to military significance, General Shalikashvilli testified on August 11, 1994 that: 
In certain limited circumstances, even one ton of chemical agent may have a military impact . . . With such variables in scale of target and impact of chemical weapons, the United States should be resolute that the 1 ton limit set by the Convention will be our guide. 
The bottom line is that a stockpile of 1 ton of chemical agent can prove of military significance. Unclassified portions of the NIE on U.S. monitoring capabilities indicate that it is unlikely that the United States will be able to detect or address violations in a timely fashion, if at all, when they occur on a small scale. And yet, even small-scale diversions of chemicals to chemical weapons production are capable, over time, of yielding a stockpile far in excess of a single ton. Moreover, few countries, if any, are engaging in much more than small-scale production of chemical agent. For example, according to today's Washington Times, Russia may produce its new nerve agents at a pilot plant in quantities of only 55 to 110 tons annually. 
In other words, the intelligence community has low confidence in its ability to detect in a timely fashion the covert production of chemical weapons which could produce militarily significant quantities. We should not cheapen the norm of effective verifiability by claiming that the CWC meets this standard--for it patently does not. 
In conclusion, verification of the CWC is plagued by the fact that too many chemicals are dual-use in nature. Chemicals used to make pen ink can be used to make deadly agent. It is impossible to monitor every soap, detergent, cosmetic, electronics, varnish, paint, pharmaceutical, and chemical plant around the world to ensure that they are not producing chemical weapons, or that toxic chemicals are not being diverted to the production of weapons elsewhere. 
Countries such as Russia are well aware that if they ratify the CWC, they can cheat with impunity. Indeed, on May 6, 1996 the Defense Intelligence Agency informed the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that Russia intends to maintain the capability to produce chemical weapons, regardless of whether or not it ratifies the CWC. 
The Senate, therefore, should not agree to this treaty until U.S. intelligence capabilities have caught up with President Clinton's Wilsonian idealism. 
Finally, I will say a word or two about the counter-arguments we have heard on this condition. Patently ignoring the conclusions of the Joint Chiefs, the administration has claimed that the right standard for detecting violations is not 1 metric ton, but a `large-scale, systematic effort by a potential adversary to equip its armed forces with a militarily significant chemical warfare capability * * *' It is absurd to say that if the intelligence community has high confidence in its ability to detect `any large-scale, systematic effort by a potential adversary to equip its armed forces with a military significant chemical warfare capability * * *' the CWC is effectively verifiable. 
I have no doubt that it would be difficult to conceal the existence of a program the scope and size of the former Soviet Union's for example. But not one of the countries that currently envisions a need for chemical weapons intends to wage World War III and conquer Western Europe. Not one. 
Again, let me reiterate just how ridiculous this argument is. Nobody--not Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, India, Pakistan, Egypt, or North Korea--is engaged in a large scale effort. 
Indeed, such a certification is inherently contradictory since a country desirous of developing a militarily significant stockpile of chemical agent need not engage in a large-scale, systematic effort. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvilli, testified before the Armed Services Committee on August 11, 1994, that:  
Even one ton of chemical agent may have a military impact . . . With such variables in scale of target and impact of chemical weapons, the United States should be resolute that the 1 ton limit set by the Convention will be our guide. 
In other words, the production of 1 militarily significant ton of agent does not require a large-scale program. To knock-out every key logistical node in Saudi Arabia, Saddam Hussein needs only a handful of SCUD's with chemical warheads. He does not need an elite force of infantry trained in chemical-environment combat. 
Accordingly, the intelligence community's confidence in its ability to detect the annual production of 1 metric ton in a timely fashion is the benchmark question by which the Senate should assess the verifiability of the CWC. I urge the Senate to reject this motion to strike and to uphold President Reagan's standard of effective verifiability. 
Mr. President, I ask that Senator Shelby of Alabama be recognized next for 10 minutes. Does the Senator have somebody?

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suppose, at this point, it would be an exercise in futility to go into great detail about why the Senate should reject this chemical weapons treaty. But let me touch on it. I ask the Chair to notify me when I have talked for 8 minutes. 
Mr. President, this treaty won't touch--won't touch--terrorist states like Libya, Iraq, Syria and North Korea. The administration admits this itself. The administration also admits that this treaty is unverifiable. The fact that Russia is already cheating, even before this treaty goes into effect, and the rather incredible refusal by the administration to bar inspectors from hostile nations, such as Iran and China, to come and `inspect' the businesses of the United States of America. It seems to me that each of these defects, in and of themselves, are reason enough to oppose the treaty. 
But one in the Senate often has to face reality. Let me say this. There is one issue that has raised the greatest concern among Senators, I believe--the issue on which the ratification vote should hinge--and that is the administration's refusal to modify Articles X and XI of this treaty. 
Now, these controversial provisions require the transfer of dangerous chemical agents, defensive gear and know-how to any nation that joins the CWC, including--get this--terrorist states like Iran and Cuba, and known proliferators, such as Russia and China. Now, think of the implications of that. If anybody is out there in televisionland, I hope you will contemplate what is going on here on the Senate floor and watch who votes how when the roll is called up yonder in just a little while. 
Former Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, during the previous public administration, the Bush administration, by the way, told the Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month that Articles X and XI amount to what he said are `a formula for greatly accelerating the proliferation of chemical warfare capabilities around the world.' 
Now, this condition is an essential protection in the Senate's resolution of ratification. It would make approval of this treaty absolutely contingent upon the administration's agreement to seek modifications of Articles X and XI. You have heard me say that over and over again for the past several weeks and months. Now, I have urged Senators to oppose efforts to strip out that key protection. But here we go again. If this motion to strike prevails, it will be an invitation to the Senate to reject the treaty entirely. But I don't think the Senate is going to accept that invitation. 
In any case, why should we modify Articles X and XI? The administration argues that, in spite of all its flaws, the CWC is better than nothing. Well, to the contrary. With Articles X and XI unmodified, this treaty is far worse than nothing. Instead of halting the spread of poison gas, this treaty will be aiding in its proliferation by helping countries like Iran modernize their chemical arsenals, giving them access to our secrets for defending against poison gas attack, and giving a United States imprimatur to third country transfers of dangerous chemicals and defensive technology to rogue states. 
Anybody who needs a road map or wants one for how this will work doesn't have to go to a lot of trouble. Just examine how Russia has taken advantage of similar provisions in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Russia is, at this very moment, using that treaty to justify its sale of nuclear reactors to Iran, under a provision known as `Atoms for Peace,' if you can believe that. Under this CWC treaty's Articles X and XI--again, I have to chuckle when I say it--dubbed `Poisons for Peace'--if Russia or China decide, for example, to build a chemical manufacturing facility in Iran, giving that terrorist regime the chemical agents and high technology it needs to modernize its chemical weapons program, Russia and China not only could argue that they are 
allowed to give Iran this technology, but that they are obliged to do so under a treaty, mind you, ratified by the Senate of the United States. 
In short, ratifying the chemical weapons treaty sends a signal to the world that something has been done about the proliferation of chemical weapons when, in fact, we would not have done anything at all except make bad matters worse, because Articles X and XI of this treaty--this dangerous, dangerous treaty--assure that the Chemical Weapons Convention will increase the spread of chemical weapons rather than stop it. 
So in this next to the last vote of the evening, Senators have a choice. In making that choice, I for one cannot imagine that the U.S. Senate would reject the advice of four former distinguished Secretaries of Defense, who testified that unless Articles X and XI are modified, the Senate should refuse to ratify this treaty. 
Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. HELMS. I am profoundly disappointed in the five votes of the Senate on the important, vital amendments. After all the debate, all the gallons of newspaper ink spilled, all of the negotiations--ultimately, I had hoped for better. But so be it. 
There isn't a person in this room, rhetoric aside, who can believe that the amendments that we have just considered are `killer amendments.' The nature of international relations, and of treaties is that what is negotiated can be renegotiated, and if necessary, negotiated anew. If our aim is a better future, what are a hundred more meetings in Geneva, or Vienna or the Hague? These amendments would have ensured that this treaty did no harm, even if it did no good. 
Now, we must vote on a treaty that, stripped of these key protections, four former Defense Secretaries have told us is contrary to the national security interests of the United States. 
The truth is that I cannot abide the pretense of action on a matter as weighty as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. If we ratify this treaty today, the Senate, with the President, will announce to the world that we have done something about the scourge of chemical weapons. We will pat ourselves on the back and go home. 
But, Mr. President, we will have done nothing. And, worse than nothing, we will have done harm. In the name of curbing the proliferation of these chemicals, we will allow rogue states to gain access to our most precious defense secrets. We will guarantee that rogue nations of the World--both those who have signed this treaty and those who have not--have the ability to manufacture chemical weapons and penetrate our Nation's most advanced chemical defenses. 
Article X and XI--`Poisons for Peace'--will foster the proliferation of those very poisons. Anyone who doubts that need only look to how Russia has abused similar provisions in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The N.P.T.'s `Atoms for Peace' provisions allows Russia to transfer to Iran, a terrorist state, a nuclear reactor. Russia has argued that the sale is perfectly legal, and Russia is right. Iran, despite its nuclear weapons program and its chemical weapons program, is a nation in full compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty. And so it will get one nuclear reactor from Russia, maybe more. And perhaps China will throw in a reactor or two as well. And we can do nothing to stop it. 
The administration says that we will not sell Iran chemical technology or defensive gear under the similar provisions of the CWC. We are not selling them nuclear reactors either. Russia is. 
And it will not be the United States which provides Iran the chemical technology. They will get it from Russia and China under `Poisons for Peace.' And Iran will give it to its terrorist allies Syria and Libya, who have not signed up to the treaty. And we will be powerless to protest--because if we ratify this treaty, here, today, in this body, we will have endorsed those transfers. 
Now this morning the President has offered us some sweeteners for the hemlock he is asking us to swallow. He promises to keep an eye on any problems Articles X and XI may cause. I appreciate his willingness to recognize the legitimacy of the concerns my colleagues and I have expressed. However, I can't help but feel that this last ditch attempt to buy off opponents to this dangerous treaty is nothing more than empty promises. 
I am a veteran of the counter-proliferation wars. Every week, I see more and more classified information about proliferation activities that should require the President, under existing law, to levy sanctions against Russia, China, or both. We never do, and we won't under the terms of the CWC with or without the assurances under Article X and XI. The President doesn't want to fight with those 800-pound gorillas. In much the same way as we will turn a blind eye while Russia helps Iran get a nuclear weapon, we will allow others to develop chemical weapons. And there won't be a darn thing we'll be able to do. 
Should Articles 10 and 11 of the CWC be renegotiated? Yes. Did the Senate err by stripping out the protections we inserted that would have required the administration to do so? Yes. And I am deeply disappointed that I was unable to convince my colleagues of the danger to the people of the United States and our allies. We have made a terrible, potentially cataclysmic, mistake today in ignoring the desperate need to revise the terms of this treaty. 
Without revision of Articles 10 and 11, this treaty is bad for America, and bad for the world. It must be voted down. For it we ratify this treaty, our children and our grandchildren will hold us accountable. They will hold us accountable when Iran or Syria or Libya or North Korea finally uses a chemical weapon--and they will do so--built with technology they acquired thanks to Articles 10 and 11 of the CWC. They will look back on this debate, look back on where each us of stood, and--mark my words--they will hold us accountable. 
Mr. President, let us listen to the wisdom of the four former Secretaries of Defense, who have urged us to oppose this treaty. Let us listen to the mountain of evidence--classified and unclassified--that has been presented over the past two days as to the dangers posed by this treaty. And most important, let us listen to our consciences. Let us vote to reject the Chemical Weapons Convention.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, of course I am disappointed by today's vote on the CWC. But I find some solace in the fact that, thanks to our efforts, this treaty is much less harmful than it would have been. I am enormously proud of Senators Kyl, Inhofe, and other Senators who stood with us despite enormous pressure against this treaty. I believe history will vindicate their efforts. 
Make no mistake, this is a dangerous treaty. But it is a little less dangerous thanks to the efforts we made to amend it, and to deliver the truth to the American people. Last September, treaty proponents were pressing the Senate to vote on a treaty that had none of the key protections that some of us succeeded in inserting in this treaty. Had we not been a phalanx of common sense standing in their way, the exact same treaty would have been before the Senate for ratification today, and that would have been a disaster. 
The treaty approved by the Senate tonight was toned down with 28 conditions, most of which the administration was until recently calling `killer amendments.' Those include, among many others, conditions that limit the cost of the treaty to the American taxpayer, place safeguards on intelligence sharing, enhance our chemical defenses, and protect confidential business information. 
Further, concessions on what I consider some of the most important issues--such as protecting the right of American commanders in the field to use tear gas, and requiring criminal search warrants for foreign inspectors--came only the final days before I agreed to allow the treaty to go to the Senate floor for a vote. If we had not held out so long--in spite of all the criticism and derision lobbed in our direction--none of those protections would be in the treaty today. 
I hope I may be forgiven for taking some satisfaction in the knowledge that, thanks to what our critics called our stubbornness, our soldiers in the field will be a little safer, and the constitutional rights of American citizens will be a little better protected. Final judgment of our efforts will be left to future generations. 
I do know this: those great Senators with whom I was honored to stand fought the good fight, we won some battles, and lost others. But we fought with honor, and integrity, and for the cause of right. 
Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as the Senate begins final consideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the immortal words of Yogi Berra come to mind. Everybody remembers them. `It's deja vu, all over again.' 
If anyone is wondering why Jesse Helms, Senator from North Carolina, is quoting a New York Yankee, it is because I always liked Yogi. And we have been here before, meaning the Senate. The point being that the Senate scheduled a time certain last September to take up this very same treaty. But, on the day of the scheduled vote, the White House asked to withdraw the treaty. Why? Well, because there were not 67 votes necessary to pass it. 
The White House stonewalled and refused to address the key concerns raised by Senators about the treaty, concerns relating to its universality, its verifiability, and crushing effect on business because they had opposed even the most reasonable modifications proposed by this Senator and many others. That is 
why the treaty was withdrawn last year. So, here we go again, with most of those critical concerns remaining in the treaty: The Chemical Weapons Convention certainly is not global, it is not verifiable, and it will not work. Even its proponents admit it cannot effectively prevent the spread of chemical weaponry. 
Time and time again, the administration has portrayed this agreement as one that will provide for a global ban on chemical weapons. I recently read a poll showing that 84 percent of the American people believed that this body should ratify a treaty which would `ban the production, possession, transfer and use of poison gas worldwide.' That was the question asked in the poll. I quoted it verbatim. If this treaty accomplished such a ban, I would be the first Senator on this floor, along with Senator Kyl, urging its approval. Had the pollster called me at home, I--if I knew nothing about the treaty, as most Americans do not--I probably would have been among the 84 percent. 
In any event, more than 8 years ago, at the confirmation hearing of Jim Baker to be Secretary of State, I noted President Bush's statement that he wanted to be able to tell his grandchildren that he, `was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the Earth.' Quote, unquote, George Bush. I remarked at that hearing that I, too, would like to be able to tell my grandchildren that I helped the President and the Secretary of State attain such a goal. And that statement that I made then is just as true today as it was on the day that I made it. But I cannot and will not sign off on a multilateral treaty that accomplishes none--n-o-n-e--none of the goals it purports to address. 
I have, on 5 January first days of the Senate, stood right over there by the dais, raised my right hand, and pledged to support and defend our country and its Constitution. I have presided over many hearings dedicated to the careful examination of this treaty. Earlier this month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee heard testimony by and from four former U.S. Defense Secretaries--Dick Cheney, Cap Weinberger, Jim Schlesinger, Don Rumsfeld, all four urging the Senate not--not to ratify this dangerously defective treaty. 
These distinguished Americans are by no means alone. More than 50 generals and admirals and senior officials from previous administrations have joined them in opposing this chemical weapons treaty--convention--call it what you will. And why have all these great Americans urged that the Senate reject this treaty? I will tell you why. Their case can be summarized this simply: It is not global, it is not verifiable, and it will not work. No supporter of this treaty can tell us with a straight face how this treaty will actually accomplish the goals that they have advertised so profusely for it. 
The best argument they have mustered to date is, as I understand it, `Oh, yes, it is defective, but it is better than nothing,' they say. Or they tell us that `It creates an international norm against the production of these weapons.' But, in fact, this treaty is worse then nothing. 
But, in fact, Mr. President, this treaty is worse than nothing, for this treaty gives the American people a false sense of security that something is being done in Washington, DC, to reduce the dangers of chemical weaponry when, in fact, nothing is being done with or by this treaty. If anything, this treaty puts the American people at greater risk. 
That is why the administration wants to avoid at all costs a real debate on the merits of this treaty. They know that they cannot defend it. They say it is better than nothing. No, it is not. So they have resorted to a number of assertions that simply do not hold up under scrutiny. They have put forward, for example, the `America as a rogue state' argument. They have said it over and over again. `Rogue state, rogue state.' 
They say if we don't ratify the CWC, we will be left `in the company of pariah nations, like Iraq and North Korea,' who have refused to join. And then they have hit us with, `Well, everybody's doing it. It is going to go into effect anyhow,' they say, and have said over and over again, `with or without the United States, so we might as well go with the flow and sign up.' 
Sorry, Mr. President--and I mean the distinguished Senator who is presiding, Mr. President, and I mean the President down on Pennsylvania Avenue as well--sorry, Mr. President, the oath that I have taken five times standing right over there forbids my taking part in such sophistry. 
Anyhow, since when did America start letting Belgium and Luxembourg and France and Bangladesh dictate our national security policy? The Senate should decide whether or not to approve this treaty on the basis of whether it is in the national interest of the United States and the American people, not to respond to diplomatic momentum of the moment. Frankly, I take offense at the argument that this administration is making widely and frequently, that rejecting this dangerous and flawed treaty would make America the moral--get this--the moral equivalent of terrorist states--that means governments, countries--terrorist governments like Syria and Iraq and Libya and North Korea. These pariahs are, at this very moment, manufacturing chemical weapons to use against us. Don't make any mistake about that. That is what they are doing right now as we meet. 
We are unilaterally destroying our chemical stockpiles with or without the Chemical Weapons Convention, and I think that such rhetorical blackmail may offend the American people. We will see. The polls are already turning around, by the way. 
Mr. President, I made a commitment to the American people that I would bring this chemical weapons treaty to the Senate floor only if it contained all the key protections necessary to ensure that this treaty does no harm, even if it can do no good, and that is exactly what is happening. That is exactly why this treaty is the pending business in the U.S. Senate at this moment. 
The resolution of ratification that is now pending before the Senate addresses all the inherent weaknesses of this treaty. With this resolution of ratification, I can vote for this treaty in good conscience, and I would dissuade no Senator from doing the same, obviously. But if those key protections are removed, taken out--and the administration says it is going to happen, they are going to be taken out, they boast--then we should refuse to ratify this treaty for the reasons that we will discuss in greater detail in the hours ahead. 
I doubt that there is a Senator in this body who has not heard a great deal about the 28 conditions in this resolution of ratification that have been agreed upon by the distinguished Senator Biden, who is the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, the administration, and me. I commend my friend, Joe Biden, for his willingness to work with me in good faith to address those issues. I have told him so privately, and I now tell him so publicly. As Joe Biden has pointed out, he spent many hours in my office in direct negotiations with me and my staff in an effort to reach some common ground. 
Many of the 28 conditions contain commonsense provisions that 
never should have been contested by the administration in the first place. For example, these conditions, among other things, require the creation of an inspector general. They limit the burden on the American taxpayer. They preserve the Australia Group. They assert the right to use tear gas in combat situations. 
Let me tell you something, if they had not yielded on that question about our using tear gas to help our downed pilots escape from the enemy, this treaty would never have come to the floor. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration has made clear--made clear--that it intends to remove five vital protections that Senator Lott and I and others have included to address the defects of the treaty, or some of them. By stripping those key conditions from this resolution, the administration is asking the Senate to ratify a treaty which, first, will affect almost none of the terrorist regimes whose possession of chemical weapons actually threatens the United States, such as Libya, Iraq, Syria, and North Korea; second, which the administration admits that they can't verify, and they can't verify this treaty. Do you remember what Ronald Reagan used to say? Trust but verify. Ronald Reagan is sort of halfway implicitly credited with this treaty. I think I knew Ronald Reagan as well as anybody. I was the first sitting Senator to support Ronald Reagan's candidacy, and I knew how he felt about treaties because he felt then as I feel now about treaties. 
Third, the administration knows that Russia is already violating the chemical weapons treaty, even before it goes into effect, by pursuing an entirely new generation of chemical agents specifically designed to circumvent the CWC, as we call it around this place, violating Russia's existing bilateral chemical weapons agreement with the United States signed some years ago and--I have to use this word--lying about their chemical stockpiles. And we are supposed to trot in and ratify this treaty? Not this Senator. Not this Senator. 
Fourth, the administration is supporting a treaty which allows inspectors from China and rogue states, such as Iran, to descend upon American businesses, rifle through the business confidential documents in each of these places, to interrogate the employees of the business, and to remove secret business information and chemical samples whenever they want to. 
A law enforcement officer in the United States cannot do that. You have to get a search warrant issued by a court. 
Fifth, the administration feels that under articles X and XI, which involve the transfer of dangerous chemicals, chemical manufacturing technology and advanced chemical defense gear to any nation who signs on, including terrorist states like Iran and Cuba and known proliferators, such as Russia and China, the administration said, `No, no, we can't have that. We can't have that.' That's what they say. We are going to find out tomorrow, or perhaps earlier, how the U.S. Senate feels about that, because there is going to be a vote on that specific question. 
We have protections in the current resolution of ratification which address all of these issues, as I have said before, and while all of these matters are vitally important, the final concluding issue, I believe, is the key to this entire debate. What is it? 
The proponents of this treaty have been telling the American people over and over and over again that this treaty will `ban chemical weapons from the face of the Earth.' How many times have I heard that by some very good friends of mine in the administration? Let me tell them something, and let me tell you something, Mr. President. With articles X and XI intact, this treaty will, in fact, do the exact opposite. It will, in fact, facilitate the spread of poison gas to the very rogue countries most likely to use it against American citizens. 
So I guess the question is, who would give the terrorist crowd in Iran chemical agents and chemical technology that they can use to build chemical weapons? Who would do that? Who would vote to give Iran the secrets to our most advanced chemical defensive equipment, the technology we have designed to protect our troops from poison-gas attack? Not this U.S. Senator. I will never, 
never vote to do that, because I stood over there five times and said I would not. But that is exactly what the Clinton administration is asking us to do by insisting that we ratify this treaty with articles X and XI intact. 
Do not take my word about all of this. Heed the warnings of some people that I believe most Americans admire and respect. Let's take Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, who served in a previous administration, the Bush administration. Dick Cheney provided written testimony to the Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month. Let me quote him. This is Dick Cheney talking:  
Articles X and XI amount to a formula for greatly accelerating the proliferation of chemical warfare capabilities around the world. 
I have heard Dick Cheney make many a speech, but I never before heard him as emphatic in his declaration about anything previous to this. 
Mr. President, anybody who wants a road map for how this will work need only examine how Russia has taken advantage of similar provisions in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Today, Russia is using the NNPT to justify, what? To justify Russia's sale of nuclear reactors under a provision known as atoms for peace. Under the chemical weapons treaty, articles X and XI, or poisons for peace provisions, as we call them, Russia and/or China could decide, for example, to build a chemical manufacturing facility in Iran and argue not only that are they allowed to give Iran this technology, but that they are obligated to do it under a treaty, mind you, that a lot of people are advocating that the United States Senate ratify tomorrow before dark. 
Worse still, the Chemical Weapons Convention also requires that we share our latest advanced chemical defensive gear with all of these countries. What that means is that, through reverse engineering, Iran could figure out how to penetrate our chemical defense, increasing not only the risk of American troops being exposed to poison gas but the chances of a chemical attack actually taking place by undermining the defensive deterrent value. 
The administration has agreed that it will not give such American technology to Iran. I think they mean it as far as it goes, but this agreement with the President will not stop other countries from doing it. Articles X and XI still facilitate trade in these technologies with more than 100 countries, many, if not most, of which do not share our policy of isolating Iran, don't you see. If they get access to United States defensive technology under the chemical weapons treaty, they will share it with other signatories, like Iran. And they could do so lawfully without violating the treaty. Further, they will share their own defense technology against dangerous dual-use chemicals regardless of what the United States says or does. 
What will happen once we put a plethora of chemical and defensive secrets out on the world market? I think you know, Mr. President. It will be only a matter of time, and a short time, before these rogue states which do not sign the treaty will get access to these defensive secrets. Iran will certainly share them with Syria and Libya. And who knows who they will, in turn, share them with. 
Ronald Reagan, as I said earlier, said that our policy in arms control--arms control of all types--must be `trust but verify.' With the Chemical Weapons Convention we can do neither. So why would we agree to a treaty which would share advanced chemicals and know-how and defensive gear with unworthy regimes? That is precisely the question before the U.S. Senate today. 
We can ratify the CWC with these key protections in place. But if the administration insists on stripping them out, taking them out, then they will have invited the Senate to refuse to ratify the chemical weapons treaty. It is up to them. Unless we include protections on these issues, any agreement we have reached on other matters amounts to little more than adding sweetener to hemlock. They may make the treaty easier to swallow, but it remains, Mr. President, just as deadly as ever before and just as injurious to the national security interest of the United States of America. 
Mr. President, we know Senators plan to address important aspects of this convention; therefore, at this time I shall defer to my colleagues who may wish to discuss this convention in greater detail, beginning with my distinguished friend, Senator Biden. 
For the reasons I have discussed and for the reasons that Senators will hear in the hours ahead, obviously, I am strongly urging the Senate to oppose any amendments to strike key protections from the resolution of ratification. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.  
Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for at least 10 minutes so that the distinguished occupant of the chair can be recognized to make a statement. While we get a replacement for him in the chair, let me say this before the matter gets too cold. The distinguished Senator from Indiana, in good faith, I know, raised a number of concerns about the Chemical Weapons Convention in terms of this. Senator Dole, in a letter dated September 11, 1996, contrary to what the distinguished Senator from Indiana said, said the following: 
To achieve this goal, a treaty must be effectively verifiable and genuinely global--encompassing all countries that possess, or could possess, chemical weapons. If the Chemical Weapons Convention now before you achieves this goal, I will support it. 
Now, of course, Senator Dole wrote that letter in good faith, and I suppose that the administration has assured him, incorrectly, that all of his concerns have been taken care of.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending April 18, the U.S. imported 7,984,000 barrels of oil each day, 684,000 barrels more than the 7,300,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 55.5 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by U.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 7,984,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I hope the distinguished ranking member will agree that the other Senator from Arizona should follow. I will leave it for him to limit his time or not. Let me do one or two other things and I will let the Senator take care of that. I noticed that two or three times in the past week--and I am used to the media criticism; as a matter of fact, I enjoy it. I have a lot of cartoons on my office wall to prove that I do enjoy it. But I noticed that two or three people said, `Helms doesn't do anything in the Foreign Relations Committee except hold up treaties.' 
Well, let's look at the record. In the past 2 years--that is to say the 104th Congress--the Foreign Relations Committee has considered 39 treaties, and the Senate approved 38 of them--the one exception being this chemical weapons treaty, which the administration pulled down just before it was to become the pending business in the Senate. 
I will read the list that I am going to put into the Record: Consideration of the CWC, in the context of the work of the committee in carrying out its responsibility to us and consent to ratification as set forth in article II, section 2, of the Constitution. Treaties considered during the 104th Congress included bilateral tax and investment treaties, important to protecting and furthering U.S. business interests abroad; 14 treaties strengthening U.S. law enforcement through extradition of criminals and access to criminal evidence in other countries. One notable example of the impact of these treaties was the ratification of the United States extradition treaty with Jordan, which enabled the United States to take into custody a suspect in the World Trade Center bombing. Extensive hearings were held by the committee to consider the START II Treaty and the Convention on Chemical Weapons. The Foreign Relations Committee also considered, and the Senate ratified, three multilateral treaties dealing with landmines and the rubber industry and international fisheries laws.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require to thank the Senator for his comment. He is right on target. 
I have been around this place quite a while, and I have seen Senators come and go but there is one situation that is endemic to the trade. A lot of Senators can be frightened about threats of 30-second television commercials 2 years hence or 4 years hence. But let me tell you something, every kind of television known to man has been used against me about practically every vote I have cast and I am still here. So I have a little policy. I started it the first time I was sworn in. I stood over there five times now taking an oath to uphold the Constitution and to do my best to defend the best interests of this country just as the Senator has and just as the Senator has talked about. 
Now, the media have with one or two rare exceptions totally ignored the appearance of the three former Secretaries of Defense who came before the Foreign Relations Committee. And one of them read the letter that the Senator has just alluded to written by Dick Cheney. I wish all Americans could have heard these three gentlemen and read the letter by Cheney because they would understand that no matter about the 30-second commercials, no matter about the news media--I have had it all thrown at me. You can come to my office and look at the wall and see all the cartoons. Every cartoon that they run I put it up on the wall to remind me that the media do not count if you stand on principles and do what you think is right. 
Now, I have an idea satisfactory to myself that a lot of Senators wish they could vote against this treaty but they are wondering about the next election. I think they better stop and wonder about the next generation. 
I thank the Senator for the fine remarks that he made. I admire the Senator very much.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I listened in amazement to some of the statements being made today about a nonexistent treaty. The treaty before us I understand, but I do not understand the descriptions that some are indicating that they believe are accurate. 
Furthermore, I was astonished at the number of companies that will be required to provide annual business information and undergo routine annual inspections under this arms control treaty, and that is what it is, an arms control treaty. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention, so-called, will affect companies engaged in coke, coal, steel production, mining, crop protection, fertilizers, paper production, wood preservation, chlorine manufacturing, color pigments, paint, ink, die stuff production, speciality coatings, powder and roof coatings, plating and packaging, compressed gas, cosmetics, toiletries and fragrances, drug chemicals manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, plastics, textiles, custom chemicals, food, wine, beer, processing and electronics, among others. 
The list I just read, as long as it is, is not all of them. So anybody sitting in television land listening to this conversation in the Senate today, I suggest, as the saying goes, wake up and smell the coffee and give some thought about what is going to happen to the business community if, as and when this treaty is ratified. 
It is not an ethereal thing that is floating through the air, dropping little rose petals, it is something that can bollix this country up. And yet what you hear from so much of the media and so much of the White House and other proponents of this treaty is simply not so. 
I note, however, that even this long list does not cover companies likely to be affected by the CWC, and I simply do not believe it advisable for the Senate to learn belatedly the far-reaching implications of this treaty for businesses of all kinds across the United States of America. As the April 15, 1997, hearing, recently, before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations demonstrated, compliance costs--compliance costs, the cost of complying with this treaty--will place a massive new regulatory burden upon so many companies who don't even know it is going to hit them, along with an unprecedented onsite inspections and data declarations that may very well compromise trade secrets vital to the competitive edge of many, many businesses. 
So you see, we are dealing with a lot of untrue, inaccurate statements. I am not saying everybody is deliberately distorting the facts. In the media, they do not know what it is all about. I did see Helen Dewar the other day sitting down and having lunch reading the treaty. Bless her heart, she was trying. She looked up and said, `I'm trying to understand this.' Well, Helen Dewar is a great reporter with a not so great newspaper, but she was sitting there eating her lunch with the treaty before her. 
I would like to take a poll of all the people who have commented on this treaty and see how many of them have even looked at it. 
That is the problem. That is the problem. But at our hearing the other day, a number of companies, including two members of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, provided testimony relating to rising concerns about the chemical weapons treaty. 
Now, then, here is a fact, indisputable: Companies will have to bear an entirely new reporting burden beyond anything required by, say, the Environmental Protection Agency or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the International Trade Commission or the Census Bureau--and just name the various State and local agencies that require reports. 
Nobody says that on Pennsylvania Avenue about those reports, about the paperwork. Oh, no, we are not going to mention that because they might ask us too many questions. That is precisely the problem. Everybody has been dancing around the truth on this treaty. As a consequence, too few Americans understand the scope of it. 
For those businesses that are covered, current reporting thresholds are much higher than those required under the CWC. Some regulations require only prospective rather than retroactive reporting. Moreover, several environmental regulations--how do you like them apples?--will apply to the chemical producers but not to processors or consumers. And reporting deadlines for the chemical weapons treaty are shorter and will require more frequent updates than estimates currently required by the EPA. 
So, if you would like to file reports with the EPA, you will file more reports with this chemical weapons treaty. The regulations imposed by EPA and OSHA and all the others, in 1992 alone, 1 year, cost the chemical industry approximately $4 billion--$4 billion with a `B'--$4.9 billion. 
Now, isn't it a bit incredible that one major chemical manufacturer employs 1,700 of its 50,000 personnel for the sole purpose of satisfying Federal and State requirements for environmental and regulatory data? That is why, Mr. President, I am concerned that while large, international chemical industries such as those represented by the Chemical Manufacturers Association may be able to afford the cost of the new regulations as a result of the ratification of this chemical weapons treaty, these same requirements will be proportionately far more burdensome for small businesses. That was the point that Don Rumsfeld, former Secretary of Defense, made when he appeared before the Foreign Relations Committee. But that was kept a secret by the news media. They hardly touched on anything that the four former Secretaries of Defense came and testified to. Well, let me correct that. One of them, it was delayed at the last moment, sent a letter. 
Now then, there are roughly 230 small businesses which custom synthesize made-to-order products and compete with the large chemical manufacturers. They generally have fewer than 100 employees. They are small businesses, and they have annual sales of less than $40 million each. 
Few, if any, of them can afford to employ the legions of lawyers just to satisfy the new reporting requirements of this chemical weapons treaty. Nobody talks about that. Sandy Berger down at the White House has not even mentioned it. He is telling Trent Lott and all the rest what to do. Yet, Bob Dole writes letters, but they did not talk about the details of the impact and the burden to be piled on the small businesses of America. 
It will not be reported in tomorrow's paper. You will not hear a thing about it unless you are looking at C-SPAN. That is one thing wrong with this country today--no warning is given the American people about some of the actions and some of the proposals that come up in the Congress of the United States. 
Mr. President, equally as important, Senators should be careful to note that the onsite inspection provisions of the CWC increase the potential for compromising proprietary information which is offered as the very basis for a company's competitive edge. Many companies will not survive if they had to do without their competitive edge. 
While it may be difficult to assess the potential dollar losses associated with the inspections under the chemical weapons treaty, it is clear, Mr. President, it is absolutely clear, that information gleaned from inspections and data declarations could be worth literally millions and millions of dollars to foreign competitors. You better believe that they will be digging for it every time they get a chance. So that is what some of us have been talking about and some of us have been pleading, let us get this thing straightened out before we make the mistake of ratifying this treaty. 
Let me tell you something. I do not enjoy having my shirttail on fire in the newspapers and on television about opposing a treaty that the newspapers and the television programs say is a wonderful treaty. But I stood there, as I said earlier this afternoon, five times, and I have taken the oath of office as a Senator. A part of that oath, I say to you, Mr. President, is to support the Constitution of the United States, defend it, and defend the American people. I have done my best to do that for every year that I have been here. 
So as Don Rumsfeld, the former Secretary of Defense, emphasized in his testimony during his appearance, which was unnoticed by the news media, his appearance before the Foreign Relations Committee, Don Rumsfeld emphasized that the greatest threat is not--is not--to the large, diversified chemical manufacturers who have the lobbyists lobbying for this treaty--you fall all over the lobbyists--but it is going to be the threat to other companies that are trying to concentrate on a single market or a particular technological nature. 
A company whose profitability and economic survival derives from the cost or quality advantage in one type of process will be particularly vulnerable to industrial espionage. 
One other thing. For some companies even visual inspection might reveal a unique process configuration of great value to a would-be competitor. 
While big chemical businesses routinely undergo Federal inspections, the chemical weapons treaty will allow a whole cadre of international inspectors from countries routinely engaging in economic espionage to inspect hundreds of facilities around the United States on a recurring basis. 
Among the companies potentially hardest hit by treaty inspections will be those companies that engage in technologically intensive applications, such as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors as well as the manufacturers of commercial and military aircraft, missiles, space-launch vehicles, and other equipment of a highly sensitive nature. The economic integrity of these companies is essential not only to the economic stability of the United States, don't you see, but in many cases to our future national security. 
I, for one, was not surprised to have discovered that the Aerospace Industries Association stated in a March 13, 1997, letter to the majority leader of the U.S. Senate:  
We are very concerned, however, that the application of the Convention's reporting and inspection regime to AIA member company facilities could unnecessary jeopardize our nation's ability to protect its national security information and proprietary technological data. 
At this point I am going to pause so that Senator Brownback can be recognized. 
We had several of those favoring the treaty in a row, and I think it is fair for Senator Brownback to be recognized--for how long?

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, tomorrow, down in Hampton, GA, a highway will be dedicated to one of our former colleagues, the distinguished former Senator Herman Talmadge. It would be fun to be there tomorrow and see Herman's reaction when the honor is announced at a luncheon in the ballroom of the Atlanta Motor Speedway. 
Fewer than one-fourth (23) of today's Members of the Senate were here when Senator Talmadge was. Because of that, I have decided to include in the Record an extensive interview with former Senator Talmadge published by The Macon, GA, Telegraph. That newspaper's Randall Savage conducted the interview. 
Mr. Savage asked good questions and Herman Talmadge gave great answers. His assessment of many things about America reflect the fact that Herman Talmadge still has the good judgment that he possessed while in the Senate.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, when the able Senators Ashcroft and Dorgan invited me to cosponsor S. 304, a bill to prohibit the use of Federal funds for assisted suicide, I unhesitatingly accepted. Now today, I do hope the Senate will promptly approve H.R. 1003, now pending which is nearly identical to S. 304 and which was passed overwhelmingly by the House this past Thursday. 
The Supreme Court's tragic Roe versus Wade decision in 1973 established that human beings--unborn children--at one end of the age spectrum are expendable for reasons of convenience and social policy; euthanasia is now the next step. Many, including this Senator who in 1973 had just been sworn in, argued that if we can justify in our own minds the destruction of the lives of those whose productive years are yet to come, what is to prevent our destroying or agreeing to end the lives of men and women who can no longer pull their own weight in society? 
That day may arrive as early as this summer. The Supreme Court is currently reviewing two circuit courts of appeals decisions which, if upheld, will affirm the constitutional right of individuals to terminate their own lives with the assistance of Dr. Kevorkian or other like-minded physicians. But inevitably, those who demand that this become an acceptable right are also expecting the taxpayers to furnish the money for it. 
At a minimum, Mr. President, surely the Senate will reject the notion that tax funded programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare, should be used to terminate the lives of human beings. Despite anybody's looking with favor on euthanasia, it is absurd to suggest that the American people must sponsor it with their already-high taxes. 
The American people emphatically reject this idea. A poll conducted last year by Wirthlin Worldwide revealed that 87 percent of people oppose Federal funding of assisted suicide. 
So, Mr. President, the bill under consideration will not outlaw euthanasia. But it will forbid the use of Federal tax dollars to fund assisted suicides. And more importantly, the Senate will heed the American people's belief that paying for such a morally objectionable procedure is just going too far.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending April 4, the United States imported 8,330,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,534,000 barrels more than the 6,796,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 56.5 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by U.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 8,330,000 barrels a day. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am genuinely grateful to the distinguished Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] and the distinguished Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] for their excellent work on this issue. They deserve credit for keeping the Senate focused on the question of Mexico's counterdrug cooperation with the United States. 
Through this resolution, Senators Coverdell and Feinstein, in a very fair and very essential way, have made clear the Senate's dissatisfaction with the status quo. 
Mr. President, I know of no Senator who was pleased with the President's decision to certify Mexico as cooperating fully with the United States; the evidence clearly supports a different conclusion. This resolution gives both the President of Mexico and President Clinton an opportunity for redemption. 
Mexico's President Zedillo has made numerous declarations against drug trafficking--which we applaud. Moreover, we recognize that President Zedillo is no Ernesto Samper. But, as for the two countries, Colombia and Mexico, the only difference between the two is that, in Colombia, the Presidency was bought and paid for by drug lords, while, in Mexico, the Presidency may be the only level of government not bought and paid for by the drug lords. 
Mr. President, U.S. law requires more than well-meaning statements for a nation to be certified as cooperating fully. Our law requires performance. In the case of Mexico, performance has fallen far short of the rhetoric. 
While the creation of bilateral commissions perhaps satisfies the bureaucratic need for meetings, meetings are meaningless unless they produce tangible results--arrests, convictions, and seizures. 
The same can be said of laws: The passage of new laws does not stop drug trafficking; enforcement of laws does. We are still waiting for any implementation whatsoever of the laws against organized crime and money laundering. Indeed, the latter's effect may have already been negated when Mexico expanded legalized gambling, a time-honored way for criminals to launder money. 
Corruption with impunity remains the modus operandi for the Federal Judicial Police, which more often resembles a criminal enterprise than a law enforcement agency. At the January wedding of drug kingpin Amado Carrillo Fuentes' sister, for example, policemen were guarding Carrillo's family and friends. This is further evidence that Mexican police are more likely to protect than arrest drug traffickers and their interests. Impunity is also the unwritten law for drug traffickers and their allies in official positions, such as Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, Zedillo's drug czar. 
Here was a case in which the senior Mexican counternaroctics official was protecting the biggest Mexican drug kingpin, Amado Carrillo. The administration argues that the arrest of General Gutierrez Rebollo is evidence of the Mexican Government's commitment to fight corruption. My questions are: Why was he ever hired in the first place as Mexico's senior counternarcotics official? Was this an intelligence failure? What damage has Gutierrez Rebollo done to compromise law enforcement and intelligence operations against the drug cartels? And are U.S. law enforcement agents now at greater risk because of this fiasco? 
Mr. President, this is not an isolated incident. Just this past Monday, on March 17, another Mexican Army general was arrested for drug corruption. It seems that on the day the administration certified the Mexican Government's cooperation with United States counterdrug efforts, this general was offering a Mexican official $1 million in exchange for allowing cocaine shipments to pass through Tijuana. 
In Mexico, corruption is not confined to the federal government. It is equally pervasive at the state and local levels. Just last week, a judge in Guadalajara dropped charges against a major drug trafficker. Also, according to credible reports, a number of state governors, who are also prominent within the ruling PRI party, have been on the drug traffickers' payroll. As long ago as 1989, I cited one of these governors, Manuel Bartlett, as one senior official compromised by drug traffickers. 
Mr. President, I won't cite all the statistics that show that, over the past 6 years, arrests of drug traffickers and cocaine seizures have decreased significantly in Mexico, while the volume of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine going through or coming from Mexico increases. Despite this record, the United States has continuously pretended that the Mexican Government has been a faithful partner in the fight against illegal drugs. The vast majority of the Mexican people are our allies; but I have grave reservations about most of the Mexican Government. 
The President and Barry McCaffrey, amongst others, have spoken eloquently about the horrors of drug use on our streets, recognizing that this scourge is destroying lives throughout this hemisphere. The American and Mexican people deserve better. Silence is tacit consent to this corruption which allows the drug trade to flourish. Only by exposing the corruption can we begin to make a genuine difference in attacking this evil. 
In this light, Mr. President, the refusal to recognize the marriage between Mexican Government officials and drug traffickers is all the more troubling. Congress must make known its disagreement with the conclusion that the Mexican Government is cooperating fully.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the remarks I am about to make will probably be the best kept secret in Washington, DC, tomorrow morning in the Washington Post or whatever. Instead, I am sure there will be ample coverage given to the various statements made by several Senators earlier in the day about how they are having trouble getting a treaty through the U.S. Senate. And certain comments were made that just had no basis in fact whatsoever. 
So this is a speech that I am going to make to set the record straight so that it will be in the Congressional Record tomorrow morning in the hopes that some soul somewhere may decide to look to see what the facts really are. 
In any case, I listened with great interest to the--what do we call it--the colloquy this morning regarding the Chemical Weapons Convention, and I think it is important to remind the Senate of some facts about the debate surrounding this controversy and, I believe, this dangerous treaty, which is perilously flawed. 
First of all, I am puzzled at the insistence of some of my Democratic colleagues on a date certain for a vote on this treaty. It appears that the supporters of the treaty want only a date certain when it suits their needs, their desires. I remember last year, they wanted a date certain for hearings on this very same subject, the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty. They wanted a date certain for committee action on the treaty; they insisted on it. 
The committee took action on the treaty. Then they wanted a date certain for floor debate and consideration of the treaty --this was last year--and we obliged them in every instance. But hours before the vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention, on their date certain, that was supposed to happen, it was announced by the majority leader the night before, but what happened? The White House called up and said, `Please withdraw the treaty.' 
Now, it was not this Senator from North Carolina or any other Senator who asked it be withdrawn. It was not Trent Lott, the majority leader. It was the Clinton administration who asked the Senate not to vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention. Do you know why? Because they didn't have enough votes to ratify the treaty. And why did they not have the votes to ratify the treaty? Because in their zeal to force this treaty down the throats of Senators, they refused flat out to address any of the serious concerns that I had and a growing number of other Senators had about this treaty. 
I remember thinking last year, and I am thinking now, about what Sam Ervin said so many times. He said, `The United States had never lost a war or won a treaty.' And you think about the treaties that we have gotten into, and Sam Ervin--I think he got that from Will Rogers--but wherever it came from, it is true, 
and particularly in a document such as the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
So the suggestion, whether stated or implied, that we are somehow holding this treaty hostage is not only fraudulent, it is simply untrue. You will not read about that in the Washington Post in the morning and CBS will not have it. They might say something about Jesse Helms holding up consideration of this treaty. But the fact is that I met for 4 hours yesterday evening with the distinguished Senator, Joe Biden, and we went down a list of many issues in that proposed treaty. And we resolved most of them. 
Let me talk a little bit about the suggestion that the committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am chairman, is failing to fulfill its responsibilities to address the Clinton administration priorities. That simply is not so. 
The Foreign Relations Committee was the first to convene a confirmation hearing for a Cabinet-rank official this year. In fact, the Foreign Relations Committee expeditiously considered and reported both of the President's Cabinet-rank nominations by the end of January. Indeed, we have cleared the calendar of nearly all of the administration's appointees, including one Assistant Secretary of State and several Ambassadors. 
Let us set the record straight with respect to negotiations concerning the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I personally met with the National Security Adviser in my office on February 5 of this year. In that meeting, I told him that my staff was prepared to begin discussions with his staff immediately. Well, day after day after day passed, and I received not one syllable of reply whatsoever to that offer. 
In an effort to get around the impasse, I wrote a seven-page letter to Mr. Berger, dated February 13, reiterating my request to begin staff-level negotiations and proposing concrete solutions for addressing the concerns that I and other Senators have about this treaty. 
Another 2 weeks elapsed before I finally received a response from Mr. Berger--four paragraphs long--in which he did not respond to one single proposal contained in my letter. Indeed, he reiterated his refusal to send any of his staff to meet directly with the staff of the Foreign Relations Committee. 
Then, on February 27, the chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee, Adm. Bud Nance--who, by the way, is recovering nicely from a near-fatal automobile accident that occurred last December, just before Christmas--came from his home in McLean to the Senate for the sole purpose of attempting to bridge this impasse. On that day, Admiral Nance met with the heads of legislative affairs of both the State Department and the NSC. 
Well, then, we move forward to March 5. Mr. Berger finally allowed the NSC staff to begin discussion with the staffs of interested Senators. So those Senators who are counting every day from now until April 29 should ask Mr. Berger why he dillied and dallied away the month of February and refused to work with the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee or the committee staff. 
Notwithstanding all of that, since March 5, the staff of the Foreign Relations Committee has participated in more than 50 hours of negotiations with the administration and other proponents of this treaty. And I must add that the distinguished majority leader, to his credit, has already devoted an extraordinary amount of time and energy to this issue. 
Last night, the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee and I, as I said earlier, spent 4 hours in my office negotiating specific provisions with some success. So, in light of all those efforts, I am perplexed as to how anyone could conclude that we are not working in good faith to resolve this matter. 
Having said that, I think the time has come for the administration to address several key concerns. Thus far, I regret to report we have not had as much success as I would have hoped. 
Indeed, it is becoming clear that the administration is treating these negotiations as an empty exercise, a perfunctory hurdle over which they must jump so that they can argue that they `tried to negotiate' with me and with the Foreign Relations Committee. 
As a result of this unfortunate attitude on the part of the White House, very little progress is being made to bridge the wide gap between us on a number of important provisions of the chemical weapons treaty. 
Our staffs have been able to reach definitive agreement with the administration on only 8 of 30 provisions. Of those, three are simple reporting requirements and one is a nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate declaration. Not one of the issues that can be regarded as critical has yet been resolved. 
But, Mr. President, having said all that, I am still determined to work with the administration and others to see if we can resolve our differences on a chemical weapons treaty. But if we are going to do that, the administration needs to return to the bargaining table and negotiate with my staff and with me in good faith. The way they have been acting, they said, `Well, we'll work it out.' `I'll do what I think is right,' they say. `And you do what we think is right.' So that does not make it a 50-50 proposition, which I am not going to accept. 
The administration needs to realize, in no uncertain terms, that unless and until they satisfy the number of concerns that various Senators, including this Senator, have relating to the treaty's universality, verifiability, constitutionality, and crushing impact on business, I am not going, personally, to move on the CWC, period. 
The chemical weapons treaty, as it now stands, is not global, as it is claimed to be. It is not verifiable. And it imposes costly and potentially unconstitutional regulatory burdens on American business. 
This treaty will do nothing--will do nothing--to reduce the dangers of poison gas. 
Almost none of the rogue nations that pose a chemical weapons threat to us--such as Iraq, Syria, Libya, North Korea--are signatories to the treaty. They are free to pursue their chemical weapons programs unimpeded by this treaty. And the intelligence community has made clear--I do know whether it has been reported in the news or not--but the intelligence community says it is not possible to monitor the compliance of signatory nations with a high level of confidence. This is a matter of record. This is a matter of testimony before the Senate. 
By the way, Russia is already violating its existing bilateral chemical weapons treaty with the United States. And the Russian military is reportedly working to circumvent the CWC with a new generation of chemical agents that are specifically crafted to evade the treaty's verification regime. 
So if the chemical weapons treaty will not do anything to reduce the dangers of chemical weapons, what will it do? 
Good question. 
Well, for one thing, it will, in fact, increase access to dangerous chemical agents to those terrorist states that do sign the treaty. Now, Douglas Feith, a chemical arms control negotiator in the Reagan administration, pointed out last week in the New Republic that the CWC will give the terrorist regimes in Iran and Cuba the right to demand access to the chemical markets of the United States and all other signatory nations and will create a treaty obligation for signatory nations to sell or give them chemical defensive gear, which is essential for any offensive program. 
Well, the treaty will also endanger American troops by its forbidding commanders in the field from using tear gas and other ground control agents. 
Worst of all, on top of all of these other deficiencies, it will impose dozens of new regulations and unprecedented and unconstitutional inspections on between 3,000 to 8,000 American businesses. Under the chemical weapons treaty, foreign inspectors will be authorized to swoop down on American businesses--without a criminal search warrant or even probable cause--and they can rifle through the records of these businesses, interrogate the employees, and even remove chemical samples. That is not only an infringement on the constitutional rights of Americans, it is an invitation to industrial espionage. Any treaty that gives foreign inspectors greater powers of search and seizure than those granted American law enforcement officials under the U.S. Constitution is a treaty in need of serious modifications. 
Last, this treaty has already begun to lull the United States and our allies into a false sense of security by creating the false impression that something is being done about the problem of chemical weapons when, in fact, nothing, nothing is being done by the treaty. I could come up with no other explanation for why the then-Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Owens, would try to strip more than $800 million in chemical defensive funding from the fiscal years defense plan, or why the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvilli, would recommend that $1.5 billion be taken out of our defense spending. 
Do not take my word for it. Listen to constitutional scholars such as Robert Bork, Ed Meese. Listen to foreign policy experts such as Jeanne Kirkpatrick, and Alexander Haig, and former Secretaries of Defense Dick Cheney, Caspar Weinberger, Donald Rumsfeld, and James Schlesinger, or ask Henry Kissinger about it. Defense Secretaries of every Republican administration since Nixon have come out against this treaty, along with literally dozens of generals, admirals and senior officials from the Reagan, Bush, Nixon, Ford, and even the Carter administrations. If the Clinton administration chooses not to address the concerns that these distinguished experts and a number of Senators have enumerated, that is their decision, but they will not get the CWC unless they sit down and talk about the problems that some of us have. 
Now, we have already sat down. We have begged to sit down before. We have scheduled. We have written letters, all to no avail. 
One other myth about the treaty, the myth of this April 29 deadline. We hear over and over again, `If we miss this deadline, it will be terrible.' Now, let me say, Mr. President, there has to be an end to the administration's Chicken Little pretense that the sky is going to fall if an agreement is not reached by April 29. This artificial deadline is a fraud created by the administration when they gave the Hungarian Government the green light to drop its instrument of ratification. The Hungarians had sought U.S. guidance on how to proceed, and the administration expressly told the Hungarians to go right ahead. 
The administration has one purpose, and that was to manufacture, to contrive, to pretend, to have a drop-dead date to blackmail the Senate into rubberstamping this dangerously defective 
treaty. Now, I for one am not going to be blackmailed into permitting a flawed treaty to be approved by such tactics. Further, the administration is disingenuous in arguing that the United States will be `shut out' of the Executive Council that implements this chemical weapons treaty, and that the U.S. personnel will be barred from the inspection regime if the United States does not ratify by April 29. Horse feathers. 
As former Defense Secretaries James Schlesinger, Caspar Weinberger, and Donald Rumsfeld noted recently in an Op-ed in the Washington Post, `In the event that the United States does decide to become a party to the CWC at a later date--perhaps after improvements are made to enhance the treaty's effectiveness--it is hard to believe its preferences regarding implementing arrangements would not be given considerable weight. This is particularly true,' this is what they wrote in the op-ed piece, `This is particularly true since the United States would then be asked to bear 25 percent of the total cost of the implementing organization's budget.' 
Now, Mr. President, it will be a concession of diplomatic incompetence to try to argue that the U.S. Government is incapable of negotiating a seat on the Executive Council and the U.S. participation in the inspection regime of a treaty for which the American taxpayers are footing 25 percent of the bill. In fact, U.S. inspectors will be hired if and when the Congress agrees to fork over millions upon millions of American taxpayers' dollars to finance this new organization. 
As for the effects on industry, Secretaries Schlesinger, Weinberger, and Rumsfeld made very clear there will be very few, if any. `The preponderance of trade in chemicals would be unaffected by the CWC's limitations, making the impact of staying out of the treaty regime, if any, fairly modest on American manufacturers.' 
It turns out that the Chemical Manufacturers Association has acknowledged that it will not lose, as it had previously claimed, $600 million in export sales. The Chemical Manufacturers Association now admits that less than one-half of 1 percent of U.S. chemical exports will be affected by this treaty, and even that number, even that number is highly suspect. 
Mr. President, it is time that the contrived myth of cataclysmic consequences of April 29 be put to rest once and for all. More important than any artificial deadline is the need to resolve the substantive issues that divide us. Without significant changes governing U.S. participation, agreed to in a resolution of ratification, there is no point in ratifying the CWC. In that case, what happens, if anything, after April 29, is academic. 
On the other hand, if the administration does come to agreement with us on these and other matters after April 29, or even before, I am confident that the distinguished Secretary of State Madeleine Albright can and will ensure the United States' interests are protected. 
Madeleine Albright is a tough lady and a capable negotiator. 
Mr. President, if the administration really wants this treaty by the artificial deadline that they deliberately created, they will have to return to the negotiating table and begin working in good faith with the staff of the Foreign Relations Committee and with me. Let me reiterate that I spent 4 hours last evening with the distinguished Senator from Delaware, [Mr. Biden]. He operated in good faith and so did I. That is what it is going to take. But there is going to have to be a lot of action going a long way in our direction on a number of substantive issues. 
For the information of anybody who may be interested, I remain of the opinion, as I indicated in my January 29 letter of this year to the majority leader, that once we have succeeded in having comprehensive reform of U.S. foreign affairs agencies, reform of the United Nations, and once the modification of the ABM and CFE treaties are submitted to the Senate for advice and consent, I will be more than willing to turn my attention to the matter of the CWC. I might be persuaded to turn to it earlier than that. Even so, any resolution of ratification for the CWC must provide key protections relating to the treaty's verification, lack of applicability to rogue states, constitutionality, and its impact on business. 
Now, I am very sincere when I say that I hope we can work out our differences. I am certainly willing to try. I hope I demonstrated that last evening and on occasions earlier than that. But, in the end, whether or not we reach agreement is a decision that only the Clinton administration can make. I think they ought to get about it and let us see what we can work out together on a fair and just basis. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I was able to hear part of the brief address by my friend from Delaware. What he apparently does not know is that I was a part of the Lott group to which he referred. I attended the meetings. I participated. That group did accomplish a few things of minor significance, but they could not do anything of importance, not in the really serious issues. 
So then they fell back, and there have been no more meetings of the Lott group. My suggestion has been followed about trying to do it on the staff level. But if the Senator from Delaware, or anyone else, thinks they can drive a stake between the majority leader and me, they will have to think again. 
I am not going to try to answer the many erroneous statements he has made. And I know he was ad-libbing and he was not hearing his staff whisper to him, and so forth. So he was operating under difficult circumstances. 
But I say, again, I want this treaty to be made into an instrument that will be beneficial to the American people and to this country. It is my intent to continue to insist upon that. It is my intent, along with the approval of the distinguished majority leader, inasmuch as we have so many new Senators who were not here last year, the distinguished occupant of the Chair being one of them, and did not have the benefit of the testimony of witnesses, pro and con, who are highly respected in the foreign relations community.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending March 14, the U.S. imported 7,849,000 barrels of oil each day, 704,000 barrels more than the 7,145,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 55 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America s oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by U.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S: now 7,849,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Ngawang Choephel is lonely, locked up in a Chinese prison in Tibet. I do hope, Mr. President, that somehow, through Radio Free Asia or other means, he will learn that the Senate of the United States is sincerely concerned about him and will continue to work for his freedom--as we will for all prisoners of conscience in China and Tibet. 
Senate Resolution 19 proposes to put the U.S. Senate on record in support of the release of Mr. Choephel, a strong resolution on China and Tibet at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva and access to Tibet for internationally recognized human rights group. 
This resolution assures Tibetans--those in Nepal and India where they wait for the day they can reclaim their homeland, and those inside Tibet where they resist the cultural, religious, and political oppression of the Chinese Central Government--we in the United States have not forgotten you. We are with you. We will always be with you. 
Yesterday, March 10, was Tibet National Uprising Day, the anniversary of Tibet's 1959 uprising against the Chinese occupation. 
For almost 40 years, the Tibetan people have been resisting Chinese occupation, while working to preserve their culture in exile in India and Nepal. Repression inside Tibet has been raised to a level not seen since the Cultural Revolution. China has absorbed large portions of Tibet into neighboring provinces and conducted a concerted campaign to dilute Tibet's population through the relocation of Han Chinese. Tibet's leaders fear that Tibetans are now in the minority inside Tibet. 
China seeks to limit the number of young people who enter religious life. Monks are forced to undergo political indoctrination and to renounce the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama himself is the focus of virulent attacks. His photograph is banned. China has detained the Panchen Lama, a young boy who is the reincarnation of Tibet's second most important religious figure, and selected its own rival Panchen Lama. The number of political prisoners has increased dramatically--Ngawang Choephel, the subject of this resolution is just one case. There are many, many others. 
Yesterday was also the opening day of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. Mr. President, Senate Resolution 19 reminds President Clinton and his administration of their responsibility to support and bring about the passage of a strong resolution on China and Tibet at Geneva, and to raise relentlessly Mr. Choephel's case, and other cases, with the Chinese Government, while pressing for access to Tibet by human rights monitors. 
The administration must take this responsibility seriously and sincerely. However, according to news reports, the administration's position on a China resolution at the Commission is just a bargaining chip in United States-China relations. There are frequent reports that the United States may drop, or soften, a resolution at Geneva in exchange for some future progress on human rights in China. 
We have been down this road before with the administration. It is difficult to fathom what the administration believes it is achieving by rushing to entice China with softer positions on human rights, on proliferation, or on Hong Kong. Last year, the administration itself reports, human rights in China deteriorated. The President himself admitted that his engagement policy has not brought results. It makes no sense to mute or abandon our objections to China's record at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in exchange for nebulous commitments. The administration must tell the truth at Geneva. 
In Burma, as well, the administration has recognized a marked deterioration in human rights over the past year. For several months, the administration has been reviewing its policy toward Burma in order to determine whether to impose a ban on new United States investment. The administration last year signed into a law specifying criteria for imposing an investment ban--first, restrictions on, physical harm to, or the exile of Aung San Suu Kyi, or second, widespread repression of the democratic opposition. 
The SLORC regime is doing both, and the administration knows it. Since last summer, the SLORC has conducted a campaign of intimidation, arrests, disappearances, and some executions of democratic activists, and those close to them. Aung San Suu Kyi has repeatedly been kept from meeting and communicating with her supporters. Her phone service has been periodically cut. Her car was attacked. 
Throughout all of this, the administration continued to review the law. It's time to follow the law. By failing to do so, the administration has signaled both the SLORC and our allies in the region that the United States isn't serious about supporting democracy or combating drug trafficking in Burma. 
Now comes a new tragedy in Burma. For the past few weeks, the SLORC has been waging a campaign against the ethnic Karen rebels, the only major ethnic army which has not yet signed a cease-fire with the regime. The Karen, who are Christian, will not submit to SLORC's control. The Thai Army has been repatriating refugees to Burma--in violation of international law. The carnage on the border provides yet another reason to invoke sanctions on the SLORC regime not just because it's the decent thing to do, but because U.S. law requires it. 
The Karen National Union was one of several ethnic nationalities which agreed in January to a common platform of support for democracy, opposition to Burma's membership in ASEAN, rejection of the rigged constitutional convention and the SLORC's cosmetic actions against narcotics production and trafficking, and opposition to foreign investment. 
The Karen National Union is part of the democratic opposition in Burma. The massive and brutal attacks on the KNU by the SLORC regime clearly trigger the Cohen-Feinstein condition on widespread repression of the democratic opposition.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished managers of the bill. 
Mr. President, I am grateful to the distinguished Senator from Arkansas Mr. [Hutchinson], for offering S. 337, which is the bill to restrict U.S. assistance to foreign organizations that perform or actively promote abortion. I am an original cosponsor of that bill. I believe it is safe to assume it will receive careful consideration in the Foreign Relations Committee. 
Mr. President, if S. 337 were law, Congress would not be tied in the existing knot regarding international population control funding that now exists. 
With regard to the pending business, I was astonished to learn that there were 21 mentions of the so-called Helms amendment during the February 13 House debate on House Joint Resolution 36. The references to the Helms amendment were prompted by the purpose of my resolution, which prohibits using foreign aid funds for performing abortions as a method of family planning.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, since the Helms amendment, so-called, is referenced in the administration's talking points, it may be that Senators will be referring to it from time to time in this debate, and therefore I feel obliged as the author of the Foreign Assistance Act to offer a few comments about what section 104(f) does and what it does not do. 
The Helms amendment has been permanent law since 1973, the year after I came to the Senate. It is a narrow restriction on how funds provided by the American taxpayers can be used. It is not a restriction on the actions of private groups--for example, International Planned Parenthood Federation--that receive funding provided by the taxpayers of this country. 
A group may use Federal funds for administrative expenses, distributions of condoms, or to pay for, if you can believe it, family planning radio soap operas and gender analysis tool kits, whatever they are. Simultaneously, funds available to these same groups from other sources can and often do pay for abortion or pro-abortion lobbying efforts. It goes without saying when the U.S. Government pays for administrative and other expenses of these groups, funds from other sources are freed up for activities that otherwise would be a violation of U.S. law. 
Which is precisely why the Reagan administration came up with the Mexico City policy--so that funds provided by the American taxpayers would not be misused to underwrite, directly or indirectly, the pro-abortion dogma of the International Planned Parenthood Federation and other similar pro-abortion foreign organizations. President Clinton, who agrees with the pro-abortion doctrine, reversed President Reagan's Mexico City policy and other pro-life protections on the second day that Mr. Clinton was in office back in 1993. 
So the administration has, therefore, once again masterfully obfuscated the real issue, which is, does the 105th Congress today agree with underwriting, directly or indirectly, organizations that make a callous business out of performing abortions and browbeating those poor Third World governments into reviewing and reversing their long-held beliefs and pro-life laws. 
I cannot condone what these organizations set out to do and I refuse to be a part of a scheme leading to the deliberate destruction of the lives of the most innocent and most helpless human beings imaginable, and those are unborn babies. 
I will vote against the pending resolution, because, as my father so often told me many years ago, he said `Son, you become a part of what you condone,' and I cannot condone this. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending February 7, the U.S. imported 7,894,000 barrels of oil each day, 942,000 barrels more than the 6,952,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
Americans relied on foreign oil for 54.9 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply. 
Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by U.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 7,894,000 barrels a day.

Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, today the Senate fulfills its constitutional duty on the nomination of Congressman Bill Richardson to serve as our country's Permanent Representative to the United Nations. 
The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations met for almost 3 hours on Wednesday, January 29, to consider the Richardson nomination. During that hearing, the committee also heard from a bipartisan group of six Members of Congress who introduced Congressman Richardson. 
That group included the distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, the junior Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, the chairman and ranking member of the House International Relations Committee, Congressmen Gilman and Hamilton, and Congressman Robert Menendez of New Jersey. 
During the hearing, Congressman Richardson was questioned extensively by many members of the committee on a broad range of issues related to the United Nations, and other foreign policy matters. 
At the conclusion of the hearing, it was agreed to keep the record open until close of business on January 31, so that Senators could submit written questions to the nominee. Five Senators submitted 135 such questions, all of which were answered in writing by Congressman Richardson. The administration also complied with a document request concerning State Department involvement with negotiations to free certain hostages in Southern Sudan. 
Earlier today, after members had spent several days examining the written replies, the committee met in a business meeting to consider this nomination. By a vote of 17 to 0, the Committee on Foreign Relations reported favorably the Richardson nomination. 
Mr. President, Congressman Richardson has been nominated to one of the Nation's top foreign policy posts. He has been nominated at a critical time in the history of the United Nations. I believe that he could very well make history as the U.S. Permanent Representative who rolled up his sleeves and worked with Congress to bring true and lasting reform to that dysfunctional institution. 
We have heard a lot of rhetoric from the administration and the international community about the need to pay arrearages to the United Nations. U.S. contributions to the United Nations have been withheld by Congress for a valid reason: to cause the U.N. bureaucracy to wake up and smell the coffee. As I told Congressman Richardson, I believe Congress may be willing to pay those arrears, but only--and I repeat emphatically, only--if payments are tied to concrete reform. 
Last month, the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had a long and productive meeting with the new U.N. Secretary General, Kofi Annan. I believe Mr. Annan genuinely wants to reform the United Nations, and I genuinely want to help him. But like Ronald Reagan used to say: `trust but verify.' 
That is why I told Mr. Annan that I intend to introduce legislation shortly that sets benchmarks for U.N. reform, and that rewards reform with payment of the U.S. arrearage. As each benchmark is met, money will be dispensed, thus ensuring U.S. contributions will be linked to concrete accomplishments. 
I have asked the Secretary General for his ideas and input, as I work with Senator Grams, who will chair the international operations subcommittee during this Congress, and as I work with other Senate colleagues to prepare this legislation. 
Mr. President, Congressman Richardson has pledged to work with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and with the Congress as a whole, in implementing concrete reforms at the United Nations. We welcome his input. 
I believe that on balance, he is well qualified for the post of U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations. I look forward to working with him in moving our agenda forward. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, one of the disappointing aspects of serving in the Senate is the inescapable and unintended detachment we so often unknowingly experience in our efforts to keep up with the joyful things happening to our friends back home and elsewhere. But it is downright discouraging to discover sometimes long after the fact, that sadness has come to our friends and their families. 
For example, the death this past December 29 of a remarkable American, Robert J. Morris, who immediately earned my admiration when I came to Washington in 1951 as administrative assistant to a fine North Carolina Senator. 
I had a note the other day from Bob Morris's widow, Joan, about his death. Mr. President, when I arrived in Washington years ago, Bob Morris was the very bright and talented chief counsel of the Internal Security Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
The New York Times on January 2 of this year reported Bob Morris's death. The headline read: `Robert J. Morris Is Dead at 82; Crusader Against Communism'.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, one troubling aspect of our determining national security is the manner in which the United States has become more and more deeply dependent upon foreign countries to supply the bulk of our energy needs for the American people. 
I was holding hearings on this perilous situation a decade ago when I was chairman of the Agriculture Committee; and again this past Congress in my present capacity as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
The administration does acknowledge that this is a national security concern, but, the administration has done precisely nothing about U.S. dependency on foreign oil. 
Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending January 24, the U.S. imported 7,840,000 barrels of oil, 945,000 barrels more than the 6,895,000 imported during the same week a year ago. 
To put it another way, Americans relied on foreign oil for 54.7 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America s oil supply. 
Which raises the inevitable questions: is anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by U.S. producers using American workers? Politicians would do well to ponder the economic calamity certain to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 7,840,000 barrels a day. 
Mr. President, as I say, I shall continue to report to the Senate--and to the American people--on a regular basis regarding the increasingly dangerous U.S. dependency on foreign oil.

Ten years ago, January 28, 1987, the Federal debt stood at $2,223,438,000,000. 
Fifteen years ago, January 28, 1982, the Federal debt stood at $1,037,631,000,000. 
Twenty-five years ago, January 28, 1972, the Federal debt stood at $426,168,000,000 which reflects a debt increase of nearly $5 trillion--$4,891,024,254,267.62--during the past 25 years. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in offering today the Oregon Inlet Protection Act of 1997, I must emphasize that this legislation is vital to thousands of North Carolinians, especially citizens who work along the northeastern coast of North Carolina known as the Outer Banks, where commercial and recreational fishermen risk their lives every day trying to navigate the hazardous waters of Oregon Inlet. 
These fishermen have been pleading for this legislation for decades because it is a matter of life or death for them. At last count, 20 fishermen have lost their lives in Oregon Inlet during the past 30 years, the latest tragedy having occurred on December 30, 1992, when a 31-foot commercial fishing vessel sank in Oregon Inlet. This was the 20th vessel to be lost in those waters since 1961. Fortunately, both crewmen were rescued, but the Coast Guard never found the wreckage. 
Mr. President, this legislation proposes neither the appropriation of money nor the authorization of new expenditures and projects; it merely requires the Secretary of the Interior to transfer two small parcels of Interior Department land to the Department of the Army so that the Corps of Engineers may begin work on a too-long-delayed project authorized by Congress in 1970--25 years ago. In doing so, 100 acres of land, adjacent to Oregon Inlet in Dare County, will be transferred to the Department of the Army. 
Reviewing the legislative history involving this project, in October 1992, then Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan issued conditional permits for the Corps of Engineers to begin the construction process; the Clinton administration unwisely revoked those permits. Therefore, the bill I'm offering today serves notice to the self-proclaimed environmentalists who have for so long stalled this project that I will continue to do everything I can to protect the lives and livelihoods of the countless commercial and recreational fishermen who have been denied greater economic opportunities because of the failure of the Federal Government to do what it should have done more than a quarter of a century ago. 
Consider this bit of history, Mr. President: In 1970, Congress authorized the stabilization of a 400-foot wide, 20 foot deep channel through Oregon Inlet and the installation of a system of jetties with a sand-bypass system designed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. But ever since 1970, this project has been repeatedly and deliberately stalled by bureaucratic roadblocks contrived by the fringe elements of the environmental movement. 
As a result, many lives and livelihoods have been lost. North Carolina's once thriving fishing industry has deteriorated, and access to the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge and the Cape Hatteras National Seashore has been threatened. Since 1970, critics of this project have repeatedly claimed that more studies and time were needed. This was nothing more than stalling tactics, pure and simple, Mr. President, while men died unnecessarily and livelihoods were destroyed. 
Mr. President, surely a quarter of a century devoted to deliberate delay is enough. The proposed Oregon Inlet project is bound to be the most over-studied project in the history of the Corps of Engineers and the Department of the Interior. Note this, Mr. President: Since 1969, the Federal Government has conducted 97--count them--97 major studies and three full-blown environmental impact statements; but, always environmentalists have demanded more and more delay. 
As for the cost-benefit factor, the Office of Management and Budget--as recently as March 14, 1991--found the project to be economically justified. Then, in December 1991, a joint committee of the Corps of Engineers and the Department of the Interior recommended to then-Interior Secretary Lujan and subsequent to that, to Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Page that the jetties be built. The people of the Outer Banks have waited in vain. And they still wait, Mr. President. 
Congress must act soon. Too many lives have been lost; the continued existence of the Outer Banks is now in question because nothing has been allowed to be done to manage the flow of sand from one end of the coastal islands to the other. If much more time is wasted, the self-appointed environmentalists won't have to worry about turtles or birds on Cape Hatteras, because a few short years hence, Oregon Inlet will have disappeared. 
To understand why this project has become one of the Interior Department's most studied and controversial projects, the October 1992 edition of The Smithsonian magazine is highly instructive. In an article titled, `This Beach Boy Sings a Song Developers Don't Want to Hear,' the magazine chronicles the adventures of a professor at a major North Carolina university who has made his living organizing opposition to all coastal engineering projects on the Outer Banks--Oregon Inlet in particular. The article further relates the confrontation between the professor and an angry Oregon Inlet fisherman, a man whose livelihood has been made more hazardous by the bureaucratic failure to keep open a safe channel at Oregon Inlet. When questioned about his motives and actions this university professor retorted that he and his radical friends boasted that they would not be satisfied until all the houses are taken off the shore to leave it the way it was before. 
Mr. President, this is the response from a professor whose home occupies a large plot of land 200 miles west in the middle of North Carolina, a professor who is all too ready to deprive other North Carolinians of their rights to live and prosper. 
That is not environmental activism. It is environmental hypocrisy. 
Mr. President, the issue is clear. The time for delay is over. This legislation will mark the beginning of the end of the jetty debate on the Outer Banks, and will address the long-neglected concerns of North Carolina's coastal residents. Congress should not delay further in doing what it should have done a quarter of a century ago.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, a week or so ago--it was on January 13, 1997, to be exact--I was among those present at what proved to be a delightful memorial service for a gentleman whose life had demonstrated his understanding of, and his fidelity to, both the miracle and the meaning of America. His name was Jeffrey St. John who had died on January 3. 
I attended the memorial service not because I was a close personal friend of Jeffrey St. John--I wish I could claim to have been, but because I admired so very much his remarkable talent and his unyielding courage in defending principles that deserve to survive. So just about everybody else present that afternoon had known Jeffrey St. John, and everybody else was equipped with personal anecdotes that more often than not demonstrated the good humor of their departed friend.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Ford's introduction of the Tobacco Products Control Act of 1997 is a good first step toward addressing the problem of youth access to tobacco products. I shall work with Senator Ford and other colleagues in solving it. 
Mr. President, the tobacco industry has made it absolutely clear that the choice to smoke must be for adults only to make. There is not one tobacco farmer in North Carolina who approves of children and teenagers smoking. 
However, the transparent vendetta waged by overzealous bureaucrats in the Food and Drug Administration against the tobacco family has been outrageous. It is a misguided attempt to expand the jurisdiction of FDA at a time when the agency is clearly failing in its stipulated mission, and is an obvious attempt to usurp congressional authority. Congress has considered--and rejected--numerous FDA attempts to regulate tobacco. 
Mr. President, I thank my able colleague, Senator Ford, who has worked so faithfully on behalf of America's tobacco farmers. Once again, I am honored to stand with him.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Federal Government is running on borrowed money--more than $5 trillion of it. As of the close of business yesterday, Tuesday, January 21, the Federal debt stood at $5,310,267,076,516.85. On a per capita basis, every man, woman, and child in America owes $19,919.19 as his or her share of the Federal debt. 
More than two centuries ago, the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence. It's time for Congress to adopt a Declaration of Economic Responsibilities and an amendment requiring the President and Congress to come up with a balanced Federal budget--now.

Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I yield myself such time as I may require. 
Mr. President, today the Senate will fulfill its constitutional duty on the nomination of Madeleine Albright to serve as Secretary of State of the United States. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations met for more than 6 hours on January 8, to consider this nomination. During that hearing, the committee heard from then Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who presented Ambassador Albright, and I think that is the first time in history that an outgoing Secretary has presented to a committee the nominee to succeed him. In any case, Secretary Christopher presented her, and the nominee, Mrs. Albright, was questioned extensively by all members of the committee on a broad range of national security issues. 
At the conclusion of the hearing, it was agreed to keep the record open until the close of business on January 10, so Senators could submit written questions to the nominee. And twelve Senators did submit more than 200 such questions, all of which were answered in writing by Ambassador Albright. 
The committee still has an outstanding document request concerning Somalia, and we fully expect that the administration will cooperate and comply with that request, as the administration has promised to do. 
In any case, this past Monday, January 20, after members had spent several days examining the written responses to questions, the committee met in a business meeting to consider the nomination. By a vote of 18 to nothing, unanimously, the Committee on Foreign Relations favorably reported the Albright nomination. 
There are Senators who support this nomination but who, nonetheless, have honest disagreements with Ambassador Albright on major foreign policy issues. As I mentioned in the hearing myself, while I do not doubt that Ambassador Albright is sincere, on some issues I believe her to be sincerely wrong. Some of those differences were discussed during the hearing, others in private. And we will continue to discuss them after she is confirmed, which I am certain she will be. 
Notwithstanding our differences, Mrs. Albright is a lady who understands Congress. She understands the important role that Congress must play in developing U.S. foreign policy. However, my support for the nominee should in no way be misconstrued as an endorsement of the administration's conduct of foreign policy. It would be insincere of me if I pretended otherwise. Many Americans, among them myself, hope that in the area of foreign policy, the next 4 years will not produce a sequel to the travail of the first 4 years. 
After 12 years of Ronald Reagan and George Bush in the White House, the United States had once again become the undisputed leader of the free world. Our friends followed us, and our enemies, the enemies of freedom, thanks to Presidents Reagan and Bush, feared and respected the United States, because we were strong. The emphasis was on our constitutional requirement as a tripartite Government, to make sure that this Nation would lead the world as a strong, strong democracy. 
Many of those important gains have been neutralized by a foreign policy too often vacillating and insecure; a foreign policy that has responded to world events, rather than shaping world events. And it is quite revealing when this administration, as it often does, boasts that the invasion of Haiti was a great foreign policy accomplishment. 
Mr. President, sending American soldiers into harm's way on a tiny Caribbean island with no vital interest at stake to replace one group of thugs with another group of thugs does not seem to me to be much of an accomplishment. In any event, the Haiti excursion, at last count, has cost the American taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
From there the list goes on and on: from Bosnia, where the United States subcontracted to the terrorist regime in Iran our responsibilities to help the Bosnians defend against genocide; to China, where vacillation led Beijing to believe it could get away with bullying Taiwan; to Somalia, where an uncertain United States policy resulted in the tragic and unnecessary deaths of 18 American Rangers; to Iraq, where our CIA Director himself admitted that Saddam Hussein is now politically stronger than ever before. 
Time and time again, during the past 4 years, a message of weakened resolve was sent around the world, and with tragic results. 
History teaches us one unmistakably clear lesson, I think, Mr. President, that being that the security of the American people is always less certain when our adversaries doubt our resolve, and our adversaries very much doubt our resolve at this moment. 
If confirmed, Ambassador Albright must move swiftly and decisively to reverse that trend, and we have discussed it. As I said earlier, she is a strong lady, she is a courageous lady. She has proved that, and she is going to have to continue to push for strength of the United States. She must bring strength and courage and coherence and direction and fresh ideas to America's foreign policy. 
Let's face it, one of her most critical responsibilities, if confirmed--and she will be--will be that the responsibility of advising the President when and where and under what conditions to commit American forces to combat or to dangerous missions abroad. Senator Chuck Hagel, a distinguished veteran of the Vietnam war and one of the newest members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, properly pressed nominee Albright on this very point during the hearing, as did another distinguished Senator, John Ashcroft. I applaud these two Senators for their perseverance on this issue, because their concerns are shared by many Senators and millions of the American people. 
We must make certain that never again will American troops be sent into harm's way unless and until there is a clearly defined and precise mission and exit strategy and a clear American national security interest at stake. The debacle in Somalia vividly demonstrated that assertive multilateralism is no way to promote any conceivable American national security interest. 
Mr. President, Ambassador Albright, based on her testimony, and I think on her career, appears to understand that concern. We have discussed it, and I am sure other Senators have discussed it with her as well. She acknowledged to the committee that with respect to the use of U.S. troops overseas, she has, and I quote her, `learned many lessons.' And I thank the Lord for that. 
She further said she is `deeply regretful of the lives lost in Somalia.' Moreover, she assured the committee that she would `never advise using American forces where other means are available, where there is not the support of Congress and the people, where there is not a possibility of or where there is no exit strategy, and where there is not the likelihood or the reality of winning.' End of quote, Ambassador Albright. 
Actions speak louder than words, of course, and we will be watching her closely. She knows that. She expects that. We will watch her to ensure that this administration has, in fact, learned from the disasters of the past 4 years. 
Another key responsibility of the next Secretary of State will be to reform and restructure the antiquated foreign policy bureaucracy. The 104th Congress passed major legislation to streamline our foreign policy apparatus and eliminate three unnecessary, bloated, and outdated Federal bureaucracies, one of which was described by its proponents in the 1960's as a `temporary' 
Federal agency. It is like Ronald Reagan said: Nothing is so near eternal life as a temporary Federal agency. But these agencies were promised to be in the 1950's and 1960's temporary, and they are still around spending money, in so many, many cases, unwisely. 
Our plan last year, and the plan that will be submitted this year, will save the American people more than a billion dollars. Instead of endorsing that legislation last year and the year before, which was vigorously supported and endorsed by five former Secretaries of State, the administration opposed it every step of the way. In fact, the administration, while trashing our proposal, never came forward with a proposal of its own, despite promises to do so by the administration. 
Vice President Gore, who served in the Senate and whom all of us like, issued a statement on January 27, 1995, promising the American people a plan to streamline the U.S. foreign policy bureaucracy and save, in his words--these are not my words, these are Al Gore's words--to save $5 billion over 5 years. 
But 2 years have passed and the distinguished Vice President has yet to put forward any such proposal. I am hopeful that Madeleine Albright will prod our friend and former colleague, Al Gore, and get to work with us on this problem, because it is a jointly realized problem. 
We must work together, and I hope I have indicated already, and some of the rest of us, that we want to work together. I pledge to do that. The support for our plan has not diminished, it has grown, among the American people. 
If Madeleine Albright is confirmed, I intend to schedule an early meeting with her and other key Senators for the purpose of working together and reaching agreement on a bipartisan plan to restructure our foreign policy institutions to meet the new challenges we will face in our next century. 
The point is this: Republican or Democrat--it doesn't matter--none of us should be willing to stand by and allow America to enter a new millennium with antiquated foreign policy institutions built, let's face it, to fight the cold war. And mark my words, if I have anything to do with it, we will not do so. 
Mrs. Albright assured the committee that she will keep an open mind as she discusses this matter, and others. I intend to hold her to that commitment to work with us, to consult with us and cooperate with us so that we can work together for the goals that she and we have discussed and mutually agreed to. 
Mrs. Albright must also work with Congress to achieve serious and lasting reform at the United Nations. The selection of a new Secretary General is an important first step, but it is only one step. 
I think the American people are tired of all the rhetoric from the international community and the State Department blaming the United States for the United Nations' so-called fiscal crisis. One quarter of every dollar that the United Nations receives for its budget comes from the taxpayers of the United States. 
Over all, American taxpayers contribute upwards of $3.5 billion to the United Nations. By contrast, more than half of the United Nations members pay just one-hundredth of 1 percent of the United Nations regular budget. Senators must keep that in mind as we begin discussions on U.N. reform. Many countries have no incentive to reform because they gain more from the United Nations than they put into it. 
So let me summarize in conclusion, Mr. President. Mrs. Albright knows that I intend to work with her. I think she understands that the entire Foreign Relations Committee intends to work with her. I intend to also work with the new Secretary-General, Mr. Annan, and with Senator Rod Grams, who is our congressional delegate to the United Nations, who has developed an important expertise on this issue. We will work with all of these and other Members of Congress to bring true reform to the United Nations, which is long overdue and badly needed. 
I believe that on balance Mrs. Albright is well qualified for the post of Secretary of State. We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of things on our agenda, and I look forward to working with her in moving our agenda forward. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it was not quite 12 months ago--on Friday, February 23, 1996--that the Federal debt broke the $5 trillion sound barrier for the first time in history. The records show that on that day, at the close of business, the debt stood at $5,017,056,630,040.53. 
Just 20 years earlier, in 1976, the Federal debt stood at $629 billion--and that was after the first 200 years of America's history had elapsed, including two world wars. Then the big spenders really went to work and the interest on the Federal debt really began to take off--and, presto, during the past two decades the Federal debt has soared into the stratosphere, increasing by more than $4 trillion in two decades from 1976 to 1996. 
So, Mr. President, as of the close of business Friday, January 17, 1997, the Federal debt stood--down-to-the-penny--at $5,309,774,506,681.99. On a per capita basis, every man, woman, and child in America owes $19,917.66 as his or her share of that debt. 
This enormous debt is a festering, escalating burden on all citizens and especially it is jeopardizing the liberty of our children and grandchildren. As Jefferson once warned, `to preserve [our] independence, we must not let our leaders load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.' 
Was Mr. Jefferson right, or what?

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today I will introduce a series of eight bills to: First, restore the right of our children to pray; second, restore the rights of the unborn; third, strengthen the penalties for drug dealers and violent acts of crime; fourth, restore the supremacy of the individual over Government-imposed quotas; and fifth, protect the constitutional right to hold and express moral beliefs. 
Mr. President, our traditions, our children, and our institutions which made this country great, are all under assault. They are not threatened in the military sense--instead they are threatened by moral decay. This Nation simply must regain its moral footing. 
We are less than 4 years away from a new century full of promise for this great country. New technologies abound and unprecedented discoveries in medicine are within our grasp. Yet, if America is to continue to prosper in the next century, Americans must retain the values and traditions established by our Founding Fathers. 
Since the beginning, America has been protected by the moral foundations on which she was established. Values like personal responsibility, liberty, respect for human life, and an abiding faith. 
These values have made America a shinning beacon on a hill and the envy of the world. 
Sadly though, we have seen a steady erosion of these values and beliefs. This raises a significant question: Where are we headed? Quo vadis America? 
Mr. President, I believe we are in a battle--in the sense that we are engaged in a struggle for the soul of America. The moral decay has also chewed away at the institution of the family and led to soaring rates of illegitimacy and drug abuse. 
The liberal establishment has turned a blind eye to what has been going on in America. Their supporters from the Hollywood crowd to Planned Parenthood set forth an agenda that eroded the values of this country. 
We live in an era when it is fashionable to pretend that our Founding Fathers did not build this country upon biblical principles. 
Mr. President, on September 7, 1864, Abraham Lincoln thanked a group of citizens for a Bible he was given saying, `In regard to this Great Book, I have but to say, it is the best gift God has given to man. All the good the Savior gave to this world was communicated through this book. But for it we could not know right from wrong.' 
It is imperative, that as we look to the next century, we not forget what brought us to this point in history--the faith and ideals of our forefathers. Alexis de Tocqueville, after traveling throughout this country, found the source of America's strength. He stated that America's greatness lies in its churches and synagogues. 
Mr. President, the legislation that I will introduce today will go a long way to ensuring that America's foundations remain secure. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Defend America Act of 1997 is a vital piece of legislation--one which provides a clear and concise blueprint for protecting the American people from the growing threat of attack from ballistic missiles carrying nuclear, chemical, or biological warheads. 
It is critical that the United States begin immediately the 8-year task of building and deploying a national missile defense. I am grateful to the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Lott, for introducing this bill and I am honored to join him as a cosponsor. 
Just over a year ago the Clinton administration vetoed the 1996 Defense Authorization Act. In his veto message, the President explicitly objected to the missile defense provisions of the act. At that time, along with others, I found it beyond belief that the administration could arrive at the decision to block the deployment of a national missile defense. I remember wondering, given the fact that North Korea is known to be developing a missile capable of striking United States cities, how such a decision could be made. 
The chairman of the National Intelligence Council, Richard Cooper, testified before the House National Security Committee on February 28, 1996, that `. . . North Korea is developing a missile, which we call the Taepo Dong 2, that could have a range sufficient to reach Alaska. The missile way also be capable of reaching some U.S. territories in the Pacific and the far western portion of the 2,000-km-long Hawaiian Island chain.' 
What Mr. Cooper did not add was the fact that nations can and have increased the ranges of their ballistic missiles by reducing payloads. 
Mr. President, a September 29, 1995, article in the Washington Times reported that the Defense Intelligence Agency has estimated that the Taepo Dong 2 could, in fact, have a range of 4,650 miles and, with a smaller warhead, could reach 6,200 miles--approximately 10,000 km. Similarly, a September 11, 1995, article in a South Korean newspaper stated that Russia believes that once the Taepo Dong 2's inertial navigation system, warhead weight, and fuel injection devices are improved, the missile could reach over 9,600 kilometers. At those ranges, the Taepo Dong 2 could drop a nuclear or biological warhead on U.S. cities as far east as Denver or Minneapolis.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this year marks the 200th anniversary of George Washington's departure from public life. A few months before the end of his Presidency, in his farewell address to the Nation, he included a parting word of advice--and a final warning--that is just as significant and relevant today as it was then. Washington counseled the new Nation: 
Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute to patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness. 
Our Founding Fathers understood well the intricate relationship between freedom and responsibility. They knew that the blessings of liberty engendered certain obligations on the part of a free people--namely, that citizens conduct their actions in such a way that society can remain cohesive without excessive government intrusion. The American experiment would never have succeeded without the traditional moral and spiritual values of the American people--values that allow people to govern themselves, rather than be governed. 
Not long ago, my friend, Margaret Thatcher, highlighted for us the words of another of our Nation's founders, John Adams, who said, `Our Constitution was designed only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.' Yet over the last 30 years, our society has evidenced increasing apathy--and, in some cases, outright hostility--toward the spiritual principles upon which our Nation was founded. 
Mr. President, Bill Bennett once observed to me that America has become the kind of country that civilized countries once dispatched missionaries to centuries ago. If we care about cleaning up the streets and classrooms, if we care about the long-term survival of our Nation--how could there be anything more important for Congress to protect than the right of America's children to participate in voluntary, constitutionally protected prayer in their schools? 
Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today will ensure that student-initiated prayer is treated the same as all other student-initiated free speech--which the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld as constitutionally protected as long as it is done in an appropriate time, place, and manner such that it `does not materially disrupt the school day'. [Tinker v. Des Moines School District, 393 U.S. 503.] 
Under this bill, school districts could not continue--in constitutional ignorance--enforcing blanket denials of students' rights to voluntary prayer and religious activity in the schools. For the first time, schools would be faced with real consequences for making uninformed and unconstitutional decisions prohibiting all voluntary prayer. The bill creates a complete system of checks and balances to ensure that school districts do not shortchange their students one way or the other. 
This proposal, Mr. President, prevents public schools from prohibiting constitutionally protected voluntary student-initiated prayer. It does not mandate school prayer and suggestions to the contrary are simply in error. Nor does it 
require schools to write any particular prayer, or compel any student to participate in prayer. It does not prevent school districts from establishing appropriate time, place, and manner restrictions on voluntary prayer--the same kind of restrictions that are placed on other forms of speech in the schools. 
What this proposal will do is prevent school districts from establishing official policies or procedures with the intent of prohibiting students from exercising their constitutionally protected right to lead, or participate in, voluntary prayer in school. 
Mr. President, this bill is especially noxious to school prayer opponents because it explodes the myth popular among school administrators and bureaucrats--a myth perpetuated by liberal groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union--that the U.S. Constitution somehow prohibits every last vestige of religion from the public schools. 
Seldom is it heard on the issue of school prayer that the Constitution also forbids governmental restrictions on the free exercise of religion, or that the Constitution protects students' free speech--whether religious or not--and that student-initiated, voluntary prayer expressed at an appropriate time, place and manner, has never been outlawed by the Supreme Court. 
Mr. President, I find it more than a little ironic that I am forced to revisit this issue on the floor of the Senate. I remind Senators that in 1994, this same proposal--offered in amendment form by Senator Lott and myself--passed this body overwhelmingly, 75 to 22. In the House of Representatives, this language was approved on two different occasions by similar 3-to-1 margins. Yet this simple protection of constitutional rights was dropped in the closing 60 seconds of a conference with no debate, no discussion, and no vote--just a wink and a nod between the senior Senator from Massachusetts and his counterpart on the House side. 
So I am obliged to offer this measure once again to protect the constitutional rights of America's children to participate in voluntary school prayer. Indeed, standing here brings to mind the words of the legendary New York Yankee catcher, manager, and philosopher Yogi Berra: `it's deja vu all over again.' 
Well, this time, Mr. President, I hope Congress will accede to the wishes of a huge majority of the American people, and enact this legislation. A Wirthlin poll reported in Reader's Digest indicates that 75 percent of our citizens favor prayer in public schools. My legislation ensures that the American people's will to protect constitutionally sanctioned prayer in our Nation's schools is accomplished--and shows Congress's respect for the moral and spiritual values that make our Nation whole.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, 2 years ago--and on five occasions prior to that--I have offered the Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act, proposing that the Senate go on record in favor of reversing the Roe versus Wade decision. That wrongful U.S. Supreme Court decision, handed down 24 years ago tomorrow, paved the way for the destruction of more than 35 million innocent children--1.5 million little innocent, helpless lives every year. 
An enormous number of men and women of all ages will descend upon Washington tomorrow--as they have every year since the fateful Roe versus Wade decision--pleading with Congress to remember that a nation which fails to value the God-given gifts of life and liberty will one day find itself in the dustbin of history. 
So, as the 105th Congress begins its work, I do hope that all Senators will give thought to the need to put an end to the legalized deliberate destruction of the lives of innocent, helpless little human beings. 
The Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act proposes four things: 
First, to put Congress clearly on record as declaring that one, every abortion destroys deliberately, the life of an unborn child; two, that the U.S. Constitution sanctions no right to abortion; and three, that Roe versus Wade was improperly decided. 
Second, this legislation will prohibition Federal funding to pay for, or to promote, abortion. Further, this legislation proposes to defund abortion permanently, thereby relieving Congress of annual legislative battles about abortion restrictions in appropriation bills. 
Third, the Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act proposes to end indirect Federal funding for abortions by one, prohibiting discrimination, at all federally funded institutions, against citizens who as a matter of conscience object to abortion and two, curtailing attorney's fees in abortion-related cases. 
Fourth, this legislation proposes that appeals to the Supreme Court be provided as a right if and when any lower Federal court declares restrictions on abortion unconstitutional, thus effectively assuring Supreme Court reconsideration of the abortion issue. 
Mr. President, it has become fashionable today for America's courts to discard the Constitution in order to create rights and protect freedoms founded upon mankind's depraved nature instead of God's eternal and moral truths. 
Yet, never has a court handed down such a misguided decision than when it created the right of a woman to choose to terminate the life of her child. Roe versus Wade has no foundation whatsoever in the text or history of the Constitution. It was a callous invention. Justice White said it best in his dissent: Roe, he declared, was an exercise in raw judicial power. 
Why has this Supreme Court's exercise in raw judicial power been allowed to stand? Why has Congress stood idly by for 24 years while 4,000 unborn babies are deliberately, intentionally destroyed every day as a result of legalized abortion? 
The answer is simple, Mr. President. Even though Roe versus Wade was and is an unconstitutional decision, Congress has been unwilling to exercise its powers to check and balance a Supreme Court that deliberately allows the destruction of the most defenseless, most innocent humanity imaginable. 
So, Mr. President, Roe versus Wade still stands; millions of children continue to be deprived of their right to live, to love, and to be loved. It is not a failure of the U.S. Constitution. It is a failure of both the Supreme Court and the Congress for 24 years to overturn Roe versus Wade.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on December 6, 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down an opinion that has undermined the prosecution of literally hundreds of violent and drug trafficking criminals. There could not have been a worse time to go soft on criminals, but when the Supreme Court's decision was announced, hardened convicts across America were overjoyed by the prospect of prison doors swinging open for them. 
Sure enough, since the Court's decision just over 1 year ago, hundreds of criminals have indeed been set free. 
The bill I am introducing today will correct the Supreme Court's blunder, and it will crack down on gun-toting thugs who commit all manner of unspeakable crimes. I am advised that my bill is being numbered S. 43, and it provides that a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence shall be imposed upon any criminal possessing a gun during and in relation to the commission of a violent or drug trafficking crime. If the criminal fires the weapon, the mandatory penalty is elevated to 10 years. If there is a killing during the crime, the punishment is life imprisonment or the death penalty. 
This is just common sense, Mr. President; violent felons who possess firearms are demonstrably more dangerous than those who do not. This legislation, of course, does not apply to anyone lawfully possessing a gun. 
Current Federal law provides that a person who, during a Federal crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, uses or carries a firearm shall be sentenced to 5 years in prison. That law has been used effectively by Federal prosecutors across the country to add 5 additional years to the prison sentences of criminals who use or carry firearms. 
But along came the Supreme Court's unwise decision thwarting prosecutors' effective use of this statute. The Court, in Bailey versus United States, interpreted the law to require that a violent felon actively employ a firearm as a precondition of receiving an additional 5-year sentence. The Court held that the firearm must be brandished, fired or otherwise actively used; so if a criminal merely possesses a firearm, but doesn't fire or otherwise use it, he escapes the additional 5 year penalty. 
Someone put it this way: As a result of the Court's decision, any thug who hides a gun under the back seat of his car, or who stashes a gun with his drugs, may now get off with a slap on the wrist. The fact is, Mr. President, that firearms are the tools of the trade of most drug traffickers. Weapons clearly facilitate the criminal transactions and embolden violent thugs to commit their crimes. 
Mr. President, this Supreme Court decision poses serious problems for law enforcement. It has weakened the Federal criminal law and has already led to the early release of hundreds of violent criminals. 
After the word got out about the Bailey decision, prisoners frantically began preparing and filing motions to get out of jail as fast as they could write. Prosecutors were inundated with petitions from criminals. One example is a man named Lancelot Martin, who ran a Haitian drug trafficking operation out of Raleigh, my hometown, the capital city of North Carolina. Martin used the U.S. Postal Service to receive and sell drugs. Police seized his drugs and recovered a 9 mm semiautomatic pistol that Martin used to protect his drug business. 
Lancelot Martin was convicted of drug trafficking charges and received a 5-year sentence for using the gun. But on March 11 of last year, years before his sentence expired, Martin walked free, simply because while his gun and a hefty supply of drugs were found--the gun was not actively employed at the time he was caught. 
So, Mr. President, this bill will ensure that future criminals possessing guns, like Lancelot Martin, serve real time when they possess a gun in furtherance of a violent or drug trafficking crime. 
The Supreme Court, recognizing the consequences of its decision, issued this invitation to us: `Had Congress intended possession alone to trigger liability * * * it easily could have so provided.' That, Mr. President, is precisely the intent of this legislation--to make clear that possession alone does indeed trigger liability. 
Mr. President, a modified version of this legislation passed the Senate last year, only to be blocked in the House of Representatives. This bill is a necessary and appropriate response to the Supreme Court's judicial limitation of the mandatory penalty for gun-toting criminals. According to Sentencing Commission statistics, more than 9,000 armed violent felons were convicted from April 1991, through October 1995. In North Carolina alone, this statute was used to help imprison over 800 violent criminals. We must strengthen law enforcement's ability to use this strong anticrime provision. 
Fighting crime is, and must be, a prime concern in America. It has been estimated that in the United States one violent crime is committed every 16 seconds. We must fight back with the most severe punishment possible for those who terrorize law-abiding citizens. Enactment of this legislation is a necessary step toward recommitting our Government and our citizens to a real honest-to-God war on crime.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Robert Smith, introduced legislation in the 104th Congress prohibiting the destruction of helpless, unborn babies by a procedure called partial-birth abortions. 
Congress heeded the outcry of the American people against this shameful abuse of the most innocent humans imaginable; the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act was passed by both the House and the Senate only to have it vetoed by President Clinton. 
Mr. President, another stalwart Senator of New Hampshire, Mr. Humphrey brought to the attention of the Senate in 1989 incredibly brutal practice in America--abortions performed solely because prospective mothers prefer a child of a gender from the babies in their womb. 
Senator Humphrey, in the 1989 debate called attention to the New York Times article published Christmas morning the year before. It was titled `Fetal Sex Test Used as Step to Abortion.' Sadly, Senator Humphrey's remarks and subsequent legislation were met with general disinterest among those who sanctimoniously defend what they regard as a woman's right to destroy her unborn child. Those holding such views never discuss an unborn child's right to live, to love and be loved.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, there's a significant question about the use of the American taxpayers' money. 
Should State and local health departments, hospitals, and other family planning organizations funded under title X of the Public Health Services Act, be specifically allowed to offer adoption services to pregnant women? 
The answer, Mr. President, is: Absolutely. 
And Congress should be unmistakably clear in expressing our judgment that public and private health facilities can and should offer adoption services. 
The vast majority of the American people agree. Many polls have shown that people approve of their tax dollars being used by clinics to promote and encourage adoptions instead of the heinous destruction of unborn children. 
Statistics emphasize the merit of the proposal that clinics and agencies receiving title X funding should explicitly be authorized to offer adoption services. The National Council for Adoption asserts that an estimated 2 million couples are today hopefully and prayerfully waiting to adopt a child. Yet, 1.5 million babies are refused the right to live every year. 
Mr. President, if every abortion in this country could be prevented this year there would still be 500,000 couples ready and waiting to adopt children. Small wonder that adoption is called `the loving option.' 
But it is even more tragic, Mr. President, that women with unplanned or unwanted pregnancies are unaware of the wonderful opportunities available to their child through adoption. These women, states Jeff Rosenberg, formerly of the National Council for Adoption, `are not hearing about adoption, and thus [are] not considering it as a possibility. Young pregnant women are frequently not told by counselors and social workers that adoption is an alternative.' 
With this in mind, I offer today the Federal Adoption Services Act of 1997, a bill that proposes to amend title X of the Public Health Services Act to permit federally-funded planning services to provide adoption services based on two factors: No. 1, the needs of the community in which the clinic is located, and No. 2, the ability of an individual clinic to provide such services. 
Mr. President, those familiar with the many Senate debates of the past regarding title X will recall the excessive emphasis placed on preventing and/or spacing of pregnancies, and limiting the size of the American family. 
I hope that this year, we can refocus this debate, emphasizing the need to affirm life rather than preventing or terminating it. 
Sure, the radical feminists and other pro-abortionists will voice their hysterical objections. So before they raise their voices, let's make clear what this legislation will not do. For example: 
No woman will be threatened or cajoled into giving up her child for adoption. Family planning clinics will not be required to provide adoption services. Rather, this legislation will make it clear that Federal policy will allow, or even encourage adoption as a means of family planning. Women who use title X services--one-third of whom are teenagers--will be in a better position to make informed, compassionate judgments about the unborn children they are carrying. 
Mr. President, I contend that it is not the responsibility of civilized society to protect the rights of the most innocent and most helpless human beings imaginable. Furthermore, shouldn't we do our best to provide couples willing to love and care for these children an opportunity to do so? That question, Mr. President, answers itself--in the affirmative.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send to the desk legislation I first submitted in amendment form on June 25, 1991--which I subsequently introduced as a bill in both the 103d and 104th Congresses. But as I introduce once more the Civil Rights Restoration Act, I recall that similar antidiscrimination legislation passed this body long before 1973, when I first became a Member of the Senate. 
Thirty-three years ago, Congress passed the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964. The intent of that legislation was to prohibit discrimination based on race in a broad variety of circumstances, including hiring practices. Proponents of the Civil Rights Act proclaimed that there was nothing in the bill that would require any quotas or preferential treatment. 
Well, three decades later, the Federal Government's quota establishment--aided and abetted by an activist Federal judiciary--have so perverted the plain language and intent of the Civil Rights Act that it is unrecognizable. My proposal today is intended to ensure that all civil rights laws are consistent with the goal of a color-blind society. 
Specifically, this legislation prevents Federal agencies, and the Federal courts, from interpreting title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to allow an employer to grant preferential treatment in employment to any group or individual on account of race. 
This proposal prohibits the use of racial quotas once and for all. During the past several years, almost every Member of the Senate--and the President of the United States--have proclaimed that they are opposed to quotas. This bill will give Senators an opportunity to reinforce their statements by voting in a rollcall vote against quotas. 
Mr. President, this legislation emphasizes that from here on out, employers must hire on a race neutral basis. They can reach out into the community to the disadvantaged and they can even have businesses with 80 or 90 percent minority workforces as long as the motivating factor in employment is not race. 
This bill clarifies section 703(j) of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to make it consistent with the intent of its authors, Hubert Humphrey and Everett Dirksen. Let me state it for the Record: 
It shall be an unlawful employment practice for any entity that is an employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee subject to this title to grant preferential treatment to any individual or group with respect to selection for, discharge from, compensation for, or the terms, conditions, or privileges of, employment or union membership, on the basis of the race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of such individual or group, for any person, except as provided in subsection (e) or paragraph (2). 
It shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an entity described in paragraph (1) to recruit individuals of an underrepresented race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, to expand the applicant pool of the individuals seeking employment or union membership with the entity. 
Specifically, this bill proposes to make part (j) of section 703 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act consistent with subsections (a) and (d) of that section. It contains the identical language used in those subsections to make preferential treatment on the basis of race--that is, quotas--an unlawful employment practice. 
Mr. President, I want to be clear that this legislation does not make outreach programs an unlawful employment practice. Under language suggested years ago by the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Bob Dole, a company can recruit and hire in the inner city, prefer people who are disadvantaged, create literacy programs, recruit in the schools, establish day care programs, and expand its labor pool in the poorest sections of the community. In other words, expansion of the employee pool is specifically provided for under this act. 
Mr. President, this legislation is necessary because in the 33 years since the passage of the Civil Rights Act, the Federal Government and the courts have combined to corrupt the spirit of the act as enumerated by both Hubert Humphrey and Everett Dirksen, who made clear that they were unalterably opposed to racial quotas. Yet in spite of the clear intent of Congress, businesses large and small must adhere to hiring quotas in order to keep the all-powerful Federal Government off their backs. 
Several times before, I have directed the attention of Senators to the Daniel Lamp Co., a small Chicago lamp factory harassed by investigators from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The CBS news program, `60 Minutes,' did a story several years back that exposed the mentality of the quota-enforcing bureaucrats at the EEOC to the Nation. 
The Daniel Lamp Co. was a small, struggling business which employed 28 people when `60 Minutes' began its investigation--8 of whom were black and 18 of whom were Hispanic. But this obviously nondiscriminatory hiring practice was simply not enough for the EEOC. According to the `60 Minutes' reporter, Morley Safer, the EEOC told the owner of the Daniel Lamp Co. that `based on other larger companies' personnel, Daniel Lamp should employ 8.45 blacks.' In other words, this small company--which had never had over 30 people on its payroll--had failed to meet the Federal Government's hiring quotas. 
The Daniel Lamp Co., which was justifiably proud of its mostly minority workforce, decided to stand up to the EEOC. For their troubles, they were forced to pay a fine of $148,000, meet the quota set by the agency, and spend $10,000 on newspaper advertisements to tell other job applicants that they might have been discriminated against--and to please contact the Daniel Lamp Co. for a potential financial windfall. 
Yet through all of this outrageous conduct, the EEOC continued to insist that the agency does not set hiring quotas. And although one would have reasonably expected that `60 Minutes' exposure of the Daniel Lamp Co.'s predicament would embarrass the Federal Government's quota establishment into mending its ways, it is still business as usual among the bureaucrats. 
For example, on November 21, 1996, my office received an unsolicited facsimile transmission from the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program [OFCCP]. For those unfamiliar with the OFCCP, this is the branch of the Department of Labor that engages in race and gender 
nose-counting for private businesses who have contracts with the federal government. 
This facsimile was titled `OFCCP Egregious Discrimination Cases.' Curious as to what constituted egregious in the eyes of the Labor Department bureaucrats, I reviewed this document--and one particular case caught my eye. 
During June 1993, OFCCP investigators conducted a so-called compliance review of the San Diego Marriott and Marina. In the course of their walk-through, the OFCCP officers believed they did not see enough African-American women in visible jobs to satisfy their notion of an acceptable workplace. 
This unscientific observation prompted a massive investigation of the San Diego Marriott's hiring practices. After a year-long inquiry--paid for by the American taxpayer, I might add--the OFCCP uncovered only this unremarkable revelation: that of the hotel's 1,579 employees, 950 were minorities and/or women, including 101 African-Americans. 
Instead of being satisfied that over 60 percent of the workforce were minorities or women, the OFCCP found this an egregious case of race discrimination--because not enough black women were employed to suit their idea of diversity. In the view of the OFCCP, a 60 percent minority workforce is insufficient unless the `right' kind of minorities are represented. Mr. President, if that is not a quota, I don't know what is. 
In any event, rather than trying to fight the Department of Labor, the San Diego Marriott settled to the tune of $627,000. And Mr. President, the Marriott Corporation could at least afford such an extravagant settlement. Thousands of small businesses across the country would be bankrupt by such a fine--and all it would take is one Federal bureaucrat failing to see what he or she considers the right kind of faces in the workplace. 
Well, this bill is designed to put an end to all this nonsense bandied about by the Federal Government's power-hungry quota establishment. 
Mr. President, as I have said at outset, this legislation should be familiar to students of history. This legislation will bring our civil rights laws full circle, putting America back on the course that Everett Dirksen and Hubert Humphrey envisioned when they sponsored the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
Speaking of Hubert Humphrey, Mr. President--he was a man admired by all of us who served with him. Senator Humphrey was one of the principal authors of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He hated the idea of quotas and preferential treatment based on race. Senator Humphrey stood right here on the floor of this chamber and said in the strongest terms possible that the Act could not possibly be interpreted to permit quotas:  
`if there is any language [in the Civil Rights Act of 1964] which provides that any employer will have to hire on the basis of percentages or quotas related to color, race, or religion or national origin, I will start eating the pages one after another because it is not there.' 
Those words have become so familiar to us during the course of our debates regarding this issue, that they perhaps need a little added emphasis. The authors of the Civil Rights Act explicitly stated that the bill was not to be interpreted to require any quotas or percentage-based hiring. 
Well, Mr. President, tell that to the Daniel Lamp Company. Tell that to the San Diego Marriot. Tell that to all the policemen, firemen, or small businessmen across this country who have found that, in the United States of America, merit and achievement is sometimes not good enough. 
Mr. President, after 30 years, it is obvious that the social experiment known as affirmative action has outlived its usefulness. It is time for the Congress to return the civil rights laws to their original intent of preventing discrimination, and restore the principles upon which our country was built--personal responsibility, self-reliance, and hard work. The Civil Rights Restoration Act aims to do just that.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, many readers of the Washington Times on December 31, 1996, were offended when they read an article, `Postal Inspectors' Bias Code Seen as Silencing Anti-Gay Views.' The article reported that the U.S. Postal Service's law enforcement branch had recently issued a new code of conduct forbidding employees from expressing their personal and religious beliefs regarding homosexuality--even during off-duty hours. 
When asked about the Postal Service's decision, Robert Maginnis, an analyst at the Family Research Council, asserted correctly that `People who have deeply-held moral beliefs * * * need not apply for the Federal jobs. Talk about discrimination! This is reverse discrimination of the worst kind.' 
Mr. Maginnis was right on target: Freedom of speech is not permitted to those who deplore the favoritism shown people who have the morals of alley cats. I recall the 1994 episode in which the Senate came to the defense of a faithful and longtime employee of the Department of Agriculture, Dr. Karl Mertz, whose freedom of speech was callously violated after he dared to stand up against sodomy. Dr. Mertz did so on his own time, when he opposed his government's giving special rights to homosexuals. 
Mr. President, during the incident involving Dr. Mertz, it because abundantly clear, at least to me, that the Clinton Administration had conducted and continues to conduct a concerted effort to give homosexuals special rights, privileges, and protections throughout the Federal agencies--rights not accorded to most other groups and individuals. 
The fact is, no other group in America is given special rights based on its sexual behavior. To grant special rights to homosexuals would be redundant--the 1964 Civil Rights Act already protects every American from discrimination. 
Moreover, the Senate, on September 10, 1996, defeated attempts by Senator Kennedy and others to amend the Civil Rights Act in order to extend special rights to employees based exclusively on the employees' sexual preferences. 
Mr. President, after Dr. Mertz's plight was brought to light in 1994, my office began to hear from Federal Government employees throughout Washington and the country who were personally concerned about the Administration's attempts to defend and promote special rights for homosexuals in the workplace. 
And we continue to hear from them. These are not hate-filled or mean-spirited; they are understandably disturbed by the government's attempts to sanction and protect a lifestyle they--and many Americans--regard as immoral. 
Mr. President, let's look at statements issued by three of the Administration's cabinet members regarding efforts by the Clinton Administration to confer special rights and protections upon homosexuals and lesbians. 
On April 15, 1993, then-Secretary of Agriculture, Mike Espy, issued a Civil Rights Policy Statement in which he stated that the USDA would `create a work environment free of discrimination and harassment based on gender or sexual orientation.' 
On December 6, 1993, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, issued her agency's directive to celebrate cultural `diversity' in a workplace free of discrimination against gays and lesbians. 
On August 30, 1994, Henry Cisneros, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, likewise informed all HUD employees that his department would not tolerate discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
In fact, Mr. President, Leonard Hirsch, president of Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Employees of the Federal Government (GLOBE), told the Washington Times that every Cabinet-level department, excluding the Pentagon, now has rules barring discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
Which brings us to the issue of whether the Federal Government intends to expand the definition of discrimination to include suppression of the constitutional rights of its employees to voice personal and religious beliefs regarding homosexuality. The fact is, it is 
already happening. 
To the delight of the homosexual community, Federal employees are required to leave their moral and spiritual views at home every morning since Federal agencies and departments have unilaterally adopted a policy to treat homosexuals as a special class protected under various titles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
Congress must not remain silent as the executive branch creates special protections for homosexuals without regard to the constitutional right of freedom of speech enjoyed by all Federal employees. That is the purpose of the legislation I offer today. 
Under this bill, no Federal department or agency shall implement or enforce any policy creating a special class of individuals in Federal employment discrimination law. This bill will also prevent the Federal government from trampling the first amendment rights of Federal employees to express their moral and spiritual values in the workplace. 
Finally, this bill will turn back the tide of the homosexual community in its efforts to force Americans to accept, and even legitimize, moral perversion.

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, something more than 7 years ago, I first reported to the Senate some evidence that a war was then being waged against America's standards of decency by some self-proclaimed `artists' funded by the national Endowment for the Arts. 
When I came to the Senate floor that day, July 26, 1989, and suggested that Senators should examine some examples of the material that the taxpayers were being required to subsidize, and that I had an amendment to put an end to it, the distinguished manager of the bill took one look and said, `We' take your amendment.' 
And that's when the battle began. Since that time some of the know-it-all media have tried in vain to make a silk purse out of the NEA's sow's ear. They failed miserably to persuade the American people that such so-called `art' deserved the taxpayers' money allocated to the arrogant artists whose minds belonged in the sewer. 
The names of these self-proclaimed `artists' consist of a wide range of curious individuals who have no regard for decency--Annie Sprinkle, Holly Hughes, and Karen Finley performing their live sex acts; Andres Serrano sticking a crucifix in a jar filled with his urine, taking a picture of it, and choosing for its title a mockery of Jesus Christ. Then there was Robert Mapplethorpe, who became noted for his filthy homosexual photographs; Joel-Peter Witken who used bodies of dead men and women to produce stomach-churning photographs; and many others. 
From burning the American flag to flouting their own bodies and those of others, such depravity knows no bounds. The only religiously-oriented `art' funded by the NEA were scurrilous attacks on the Catholic church or blasphemous insults to the deity of Jesus Christ. 
More recently, The Washington Times, in an article last June, reported that the National Endowment for the Arts had, in 1995, awarded $31,500 to a lesbian film director for her production of the film titled, `Watermelon Woman'. In her description of the film to the NEA, the film's director boasted that with the NEA's support, she would `be one of the first African American lesbian film makers who promotes our rarely seen lifestyles.' 
Mr. President, I will not waste the Senate's time further detailing the outrageous abuse of Federal tax dollars by the National Endowment for the Arts. But it continues, despite the efforts by those in Congress to reform the agency. Sadly, the real travesty is found in the efforts of a few misguided souls to defend requiring the American taxpayers to finance the attempted to glorify perversion and immorality. 
When I came to the Senate floor that day in 1989, I told Senators that the arts community and the media--because they balked at any restriction on Federal funding--had left Congress with two choices: First, absolutely no Federal presence in the arts; or second, granting artists the absolute freedom to use tax dollars as they wish, regardless of how vulgar, blasphemous, or despicable their works may be. I said at the time that if we indeed must make this choice, then the Federal Government should get out of the arts. But, I felt then that 
Congress could make another choice--to clean up the NEA, and merely prevent the use of Federal funds to support the creation or production of vulgar or sacrilegious works. 
Well, Mr. President, as Paul Harvey says, now you know the rest of the story. For more than 7 years, I offered numerous amendments to put an end to the taxpayer-subsidized obscenity I've detailed today. But without fail, every year, the American people are shocked to hear of another instance in which the NEA has given its blessing--and the taxpayers' money--to an organization or individual determined to cross the lines of decency and morality. 
The last card was played out, Mr. President, when a liberal Federal appeals court, on November 5, 1996, usurped the right of Congress to put any semblance of restrictions on the way the NEA uses the money granted to it by Congress. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court thumbed its nose at Congress--and the American people--when it upheld the right of so-called `artists' such as Karen Finley and Holly Hughes to continue to be subsidized for their decadent acts. 
Mr. President, no more choices or compromises remain. I have concluded, as have so many Americans, that the only way Congress can stop the irresponsible use of the taxpayers' money by the NEA is to abolish it. 
Moreover, there is much to be said for the priority to confront the existing $5.3 trillion Federal debt and the effect that it will have on the futures of today's young people. The sky will not fall if the Congress votes to privatize the NEA as the arts already swim in an ocean of private funds--more than $9 billion annually. Bruce Fein wrote in his editorial, `Dollars for Depravity,' that `NEA funds are but a tiny fraction of national art expenditures. Thus, a denial of an NEA grant is far from tantamount to a professional death sentence.' 
For these reasons, I today introduce The National Endowment for the Arts Termination Act of 1997. The bill mirrors the legislation offered in the House of Representatives this year by Phil Crane, Sam Johnson, and Charlie Norwood. 
This bill finally alleviates the burden, shouldered by the American taxpayers, of allocating money every year to an agency whose mission has been sorely mistreated. The strings will be cut and the Federal government will no longer be in the business of propping up `artists' such as Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano. Furthermore, Congress will rid itself of the annual fight to defend the cultural high ground against a group of people who are in a lifelong crusade to destroy the Judeo-Christian foundations of this country. 
Mr. President, this bill is the only solution to end the irresponsible use of the taxpayers' money by this agency. Efforts to reform it have failed. It is time to put the National Endowment for the Arts to rest.
