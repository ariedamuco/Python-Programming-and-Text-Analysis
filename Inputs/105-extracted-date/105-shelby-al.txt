Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with my colleague from South Carolina, the distinguished President pro tempore, in this effort to increase funding for research into the use of polymer additives for asphalt and concrete pavement. 
The Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee directed that $2 million be committed for further research into polymer additives. Limited resources prohibited us from committing additional resources to this effort. 
The provision the Committee added to the Report was designed to respond to a shortfall in this area by directing federal research efforts into further study of the effects of polymer additives on pavement quality and performance. 
I greatly appreciate the Senator from South Carolina's interest in this matter, and I look forward to working with him and the FHWA to ensure this research is completed and reported to the states and other interested parties in a timely fashion.

Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Majority Leader and Chairman Campbell for their support. The lack of public access to research data feeds general public mistrust of the government and undermines support for major regulatory programs. This measure was long overdue and it represents a first step in ensuring that the public has access to all studies used by the Federal government to develop Federal policy.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend, Senator Kyl, for introducing S. 1194--the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act and for his leadership on this issue. 
I firmly believe it is my obligation, as an elected member of the United States Senate, to defend the liberty of the constituents that put me in office. Freedom manifests itself in various ways, but one fundamental concept of importance in America is the protection of one's discretion over one's financial resources. I often raise this issue in the context of taxes, but in addition to allowing one to reap what one sows, it is equally important that people have the ability to spend their earnings as they see fit. 
I want to be perfectly clear what I think the essence is of what we are discussing when the issue of Medicare private contracting arises. We are talking about allowing people to spend their money as they see fit. This is a very simple, yet important, freedom that people enjoy. We are not talking about letting people buy illegal products, but rather about the right of people to spend their money on health care. Only in Washington DC could such a notion be considered controversial. But to those who have little regard for individual freedom, and who have a vested interest in seeing the scope and power of government grow, this is a controversial matter. 
H.L. Menken once said that `the most dangerous man, to any government, is the man who is able to think things out for himself.' That is the threat, Mr. President. Those that favor the Medicare monopoly, often even to the detriment of Medicare beneficiaries, resist the freedom of people to make these private decisions, because it threatens the government's control of health care delivery. 
Unfortunately the era of big government is not over. In fact, it is alive and well and is embodied in Section 4507 of last year's Balanced Budget Act. Therefore, I want to request that Majority Leader Lott and Finance Committee Chairman Roth help us attach S. 1194 to the first appropriate legislative vehicle, so that we can repeal Section 4507. Mr. President, we must restore the right of our elderly to buy the health care they feel they need, without any `big government' constraints on their decisions. This effort is important not only to our ensuring quality health care to our elderly, but also to the larger battle of defending freedom in America.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to ask that my colleagues support the Conference Report on the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. 
I want to thank Chairman Young for his leadership in the Conference, and note for my colleagues that Chairman Goss was unable to chair the conference due to a serious medical condition in his family. We all wish Mrs. Goss a speedy recovery. 
I believe that the Conference Committee put together a solid package for consideration by the full Senate that fairly represents the intelligence priorities set forth in both the Senate and House versions of the Intelligence Authorization Act. I am pleased to report that the Conference Committee accomplished its task in a strong bipartisan manner, and I want to thank my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, for working so closely with me to produce this legislation. 
I believe that the Conference Report embraces many of the key recommendations that the Senate adopted in its version of the bill. 
We recommended significant increases in funding for high-priority projects aimed at better positioning the Intelligence Community for the threats of the 21st Century, while at the same time reducing funds for programs and activities that were not adequately justified or redundant. 
The Conference Report includes key initiatives that I believe are vital for the future of our Intelligence Community. 
These initiatives include: bolstering advanced research and development across the Community, to facilitate, among other things, the modernization of NSA and CIA; strengthening efforts in counter-proliferation, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, counter-intelligence, and effective covert action; expanding the collection and exploitation of measurements and signatures intelligence, especially ballistic missile intelligence; developing reconnaissance systems based on new small satellite technologies that provide flexible, affordable collection from space with radars to detect moving targets; boosting education, recruiting, and technical training for Intelligence Community personnel; enhancing analytical capabilities; streamlining dissemination of intelligence products; and providing new tools for information operations. 
The conferees have provided the funds and guidance to ensure that military commanders and national policymakers continue to receive timely, accurate information on threats to our security. 
At the same time, we have found some critical areas within the Community that are in need of major improvements. 
First, the CIA's foremost mission of providing timely intelligence based on human sources (`HUMINT') is in grave jeopardy. CIA case officers today do not have the training or the equipment needed to keep their true identities hidden, to communicate covertly with agents, or to plant sophisticated listening devices and other collection tools that will provide timely intelligence on an adversary's intentions. 
Second, what many see as the `crown jewel' of U.S. Intelligence--the National Security Agency's signals intelligence capability--likewise is in dire need of modernization. The digital and fiber optic revolutions are here-and-now, but NSA is still predominantly oriented toward cold war-era threats. 
The Director of NSA has recommended major changes in how NSA performs its mission--changes we endorse--but those recommendations were not adequately addressed in the President's budget. 
Third, promising technologies and systems for detecting missiles and other threats were short-changed in the President's budget request. Likewise, robust funding for new tools for conducting information warfare, new sensors to detect and counter proliferation, and a demonstration of radar technology on small and affordable satellites were not adequately addressed in the budget request. 
And fourth, the declining quality of analysis within the Intelligence Community is cause for great concern. 
Responding to the failure to predict the Indian nuclear tests, the Director of Central Intelligence commissioned retired Admiral David Jeremiah to review what went wrong and why. Among other findings, Admiral Jeremiah concluded that Intelligence Community analysts were complacent; they based their analyses on faulty assumptions; and engaged in wishful thinking. It is my belief that such is the state of analysis as it relates to many issues and problems, including political-military developments in China, the ballistic missile threat, and more. We can and should expect more from the Intelligence Community. 
And as we demand more from our Intelligence Community in a number of areas, we also demand fiscal responsibility. The Conference Report includes a number of reductions to programs that were not adequately justified or were redundant with other elements within the Intelligence Community. 
The Conference Report also places some fiscal restraints on programs that have historically been allowed to grow unbounded. These programs are primarily in the area of technical satellite collection, and the conferees placed a cost cap on the National Reconnaissance Office's next generation imagery satellite constellation, called the Future Imagery Architecture. I believe that this action is necessary to ensure that the program stays on a solid fiscal footing from the start, and focuses on the key performance parameters generated by the Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense's Joint Requirements Oversight Council. 
Finally, the Conference Report includes a provision to name the CIA Headquarters Compound after President George Bush. I am happy that we were able to recognize President Bush's service to this country as both Director of Central Intelligence and as President. As DCI, Mr. Bush brought innovation to the CIA, and dramatically improved the morale within the Agency. 
He demonstrated leadership and integrity at a time when both were desperately needed to help restore confidence in the CIA and the other elements that make up the Intelligence Community. It is a fitting tribute that we designate CIA headquarters the George Bush Center for Intelligence. 
Mr. President, the Conference Committee worked closely together, in a strong bipartisan fashion, to produce a comprehensive Intelligence Authorization Act, and I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss language that has been added to the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. The language, establishing the `Intelligence Community Whistleblower Act of 1998,' creates a process by which employees of intelligence agencies can provide information to Congress about certain potential problems without fear of reprisal or threats or reprisal. 
Some of these provisions create duties for the Inspectors General (IGs) of the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice, and modify the Inspector General Act of 1978. As a result, they fall squarely within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, which is the Senate's primary oversight committee for the IG community. 
However, Senator Thompson, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, worked with me to ensure that the language comports with the overall framework of the Inspector General Act. I thank my colleague for his participation in this issue.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to the debate regarding the FY 1999 Agriculture Appropriations bill. While I know this bill contains numerous important items including funding for agricultural research, credit programs, conservation programs, and food safety initiatives, I want to specifically mention my concern regarding the portions of this legislation which provide emergency relief to America's farmers. 
The last few years have been very difficult for America's farmers. I know this very well because of the numerous difficulties suffered by farmers in my state of Alabama. Last year, North Alabama was hit with an especially cold and rainy spring which greatly reduced the yields of cotton farmers. Peanut farmers in Southeastern Alabama were hit with a toxic mold blight which cost them greatly when they tried to market their peanuts. Before the close of the Summer of 1997, Hurricane Danny dumped inches of rain on and brought devastating winds to Southwestern Alabama. This storm alone caused millions of dollars in crop losses and farm related damages. 
Mr. President, unfortunately I cannot say that weather conditions improved much in Alabama this year. Early spring flooding was followed by devastating heat and drought. Alabama's cotton producers, corn producers, cattle producers and peanut producers were forced to battle extreme conditions as they tried to keep crops and livestock alive. If this was not enough, Hurricane Georges swept through the Gulf Coast this past week and caused millions of dollars more in crop losses. 
To add insult to these weather-induced injuries, the troubled economic conditions in Asia and throughout other parts of the world have decreased the number of available markets for our farmers. The loss of these markets has in turn led to lower prices. Where our farmers have actually made a crop, they are finding that the market has bottomed out and there is very little profit available to them. 
Mr. President, a series of natural disasters coupled with economic collapse have hit Alabama's farmers extremely hard. They need help. 
I am well aware of the fact that many other regions have suffered significant farm-related losses. As I have pointed out, however they have not been affected exclusively. I want the devastation that Alabama's farmers have suffered to be recognized on the record. 
Mr. President, this bill provides $2.1 billion in disaster assistance funding and grants the Secretary of Agriculture broad discretion to implement disaster assistance awards. I urge the Secretary to make a full and complete review of all the factors affecting farmers in every region of the country. I want it noted that I believe that it is fundamentally important that the Secretary be aware of the extreme conditions that have befallen farmers in my state. 
When Secretary Glickman makes the awards for farm disasters and economic losses, I want him to make them based on a fair appraisal of all farm losses throughout the country. I believe that all my colleagues will agree. Our farmers deserve no less.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will take just a minute tonight. I associate myself with Senator Gramm. We worked on this together in the Banking Committee and we will be working together on this for a long time. I will take a minute to inform the Senate of my objections to H.R. 10. 
I believe that members of the Senate have not had the proper time to study and debate this matter. Most do not even know what is in this bill. This is a very complicated bill. There are a lot of good things in it, but there are some things that Senator Gramm has raised and I will raise as the debate goes along that we need to debate and we need to take out of this bill. I believe Senators are just being told basically that this is a historical opportunity, you must pass H.R. 10. 
Think about it tonight. We make history in this Chamber, the U.S. Senate, every day. If we pass H.R. 10 just because everyone on Wall Street tells us to pass H.R. 10, this will, indeed, be a historical moment. But I don't believe that is going to happen, not with a lot of the provisions that are now in the bill. 
If H.R. 10 is so great, why is everyone reluctant to debate the bill? How come the members of the Senate Banking Committee were not permitted to read, study, or share the manager's amendment until the morning of the markup? Is that the way a Committee is supposed to function? What is hidden in this bill? 
I'll tell you one thing that is in this bill--so well hidden, not one of the bank trade associations--not the American Bankers Association, the Independent Bankers Association of America, America's Community Bankers, the Bankers Roundtable or even the Consumer Bankers Association knew the implications of the CRA expansion in this bill until Senator Gramm and I sent around a `Dear Colleague' about a week and a half ago. None of those associations realized that they were subjecting member bank officers and directors to million-dollar-a-day civil money penalties for CRA noncompliance. 
Why didn't the associations realize this? These associations are caught up in the rush to judgment. They have not given proper consideration to this bill, and neither have we. 
With less than a week to go in this Congress, H.R. 10 is being jammed through the Senate. The Senate is supposed to be the deliberative body. 
There are many good things in H.R. 10, Mr. President, but there are also many bad things in H.R. 10. Currently, community groups and even labor unions use CRA to protest the merger of financial institutions. Most of the time, the merging institutions are forced to pay off the protest groups just in order to consummate the merger. Make no mistake about it, this is legalized extortion, one that the U.S. government is aiding and abetting. 
The financial institutions who support this bill are used to paying off consumer groups. Nationsbank and BankAmerica have committed $350 billion to CRA in order to merge. Citibank and Travelers Group have committed over $100 billion to CRA in order to merge. These large institutions are used to paying a toll every time they want to do business. 
That may be fine for Wall Street, but that is not fine for Main Street. Not every financial institution around the country has $350 billion to buy off consumer groups and labor unions. 
Who do you think pays for this legalized extortion? I'll tell you who: all the paying customers in this country. Everybody is complaining about large institutions charging more and more fees at higher rates, ATM fees, late fees and the like. It takes a lot of fees to pay for a $350 billion CRA commitment. 
Senator Gramm and I have consistently stated our position since the Banking Committee first held a hearing on H.R. 10 several months ago. We will not seek to repeal, reduce or eliminate the CRA as it stands in its current form. However, we will not agree to expanding either the scope or the enforcement authority of CRA in H.R. 10. 
Now, some have insisted on expanding both the scope and enforcement authority of CRA in H.R. 10. In this bill, some even delink CRA from deposit insurance and subject bank affiliated wholesale financial institutions woofies to CRA. The interesting thing about this is the woofies do not take deposits of less than $100,000 and are not insured by the Federal Government. 
I guess, we could roll over like all the banks before us who have paid off the consumer groups. But, I for one, will not succumb to that kind of extortion, and I will fight this thing as long as it stays in the bill. Government mandated credit allocation is wrong. Legalized extortion is wrong. 
Last week, Senator Gramm said that this is a principled objection. It is. We will not be bought off by Wall Street. Wall Street does not have the best interest of Americans in mind in this bill. The only thing they understand is dollars and cents. The principle they understand is profit. The interest of Wall Street is not always the interest of Main Street. 
Here is a message for Wall Street in terms I hope they can understand: If you really want to pass financial modernization, in order to consummate mergers and make money off of every American by offering a vast array of services, go to those that are insisting on expanding CRA and ask them to work with Senator Gramm and myself in making H.R. 10 CRA neutral. Otherwise, I believe this bill will ultimately fail. There may be some late nights and strong words, but I, for one, am committed to ensuring this bill will not become law.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to first associate myself entirely with the remarks of the Senator from Texas. He was speaking very articulately for himself. But he was also speaking for me and a lot of other people, I believe, here in the Senate when he was talking about the problems with H.R. 10. There are a lot of good things in H.R. 10. But one of the most reprehensible things, I believe, Mr. President, is the expansion of the Community Reinvestment Act. Senator Gramm has gone to great lengths to explain that tonight. 
But before any of my colleagues would think about voting for the bill, if it comes up, H.R. 10, I think they ought to ask themselves and ask their local bankers, small bankers, the small directors and the officers if they in America support these measures that I think are reprehensible, such as increased administrative enforcement authority of the regulators to fine directors and officers of banks up to $1 million a day for CRA noncompliance. That is not the law today. 
Two, that would make activities like insurance sales, or mutual fund sales, subject to CRA compliance on all depository institution affiliates on an ongoing basis. That is not the law today; and regulatory authority to shut down any affiliate within the holding company if just one subsidiary depository institution falls out of CRA compliance. 
Just think about this. These are sweeping, sweeping changes in the law as we know it today. 
Senator Gramm talked at length about passing this banking reform bill--and I think it has a lot of reform in it--and keeping CRA neutral; not bother or try to repeal the CRA law as it exists today, although I personally would like to; leave it alone for another day, but not to try to expand it, either. 
Those are some of my concerns. 
Senator Gramm and I have offered and we are hoping to negotiate with the proponents of this legislation for a resolution to the problems dealing with CRA issues. I will go over them one more time. 
Mr. President, it would apply to the formation of financial services holding companies the same CRA structure that applies to the formation of bank holding companies today. I don't see anything wrong with that. It would be uniform, and it makes a lot of sense. 
Second, Mr. President, any financial institution that has been found to be in compliance with CRA in its most recent exam shall be deemed to be in compliance with CRA for all purposes and for any action until its next regularly scheduled CRA exam. 
And, thirdly--I think this is very important--to put forth some language in there dealing with antifraud, antibribery provisions, and to say basically that it shall be illegal for any financial institution in connection with the CRA review evaluation or consideration to give anyone not employed by the bank any grant or subsidy in cash, or in kind, or to establish any quota, or set aside for employment, management, sales, purchases, or other business activities other than activities voluntarily undertaken by the financial institution to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which the financial institution is chartered. 
This makes a lot of sense to me. I think it makes sense that people would focus in on this as we debate this bill. 
But I just want to again say that we should go ahead if we could knock out and make CRA neutral in this; go ahead and work on the merits of H.R. 10, which are many, and try to do something. If we can't, Senator Gramm--and there will be others--and I are going to do everything we can to protect our rights here in the Senate.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to James Francis (Jimmy) Crawford, a tireless public servant, a prominent businessman, and a man whose deep religious convictions touched the lives of many. Jimmy Crawford was a lifelong resident of Abbeville, Alabama, and was serving his third consecutive term as mayor. His contributions to the city of Abbeville left an indelible mark in the memories of all who knew him. Jimmy passed away on Thursday morning, September 17, 1998 at the age of 58. 
Throughout his life, Jimmy Crawford selflessly dedicated himself to the benefit of others and stood by his principles and ideals in an unwavering fashion. From his early youth, Jimmy demonstrated a considerable eagerness to help others. Growing up in Abbeville, Jimmy was active in the Boy Scouts of America, achieving the highest possible rank of Eagle Scout. After graduating from Abbeville High School in 1957, Jimmy attended school at Howard College, now Samford University. At Howard, Jimmy earned the distinction of being named in Who's Who Among American Colleges and Universities. These accomplishments served as a hint of the dedicated life which Jimmy would eventually lead. 
Upon his return to Abbeville, Jimmy quickly became a respected and admired businessman in the community. His rental and finance firm provided the vehicle for Jimmy to help to organize and assist area businesses. He was the charter president of the Abbeville Jaycees, and was awarded the highest Jaycees honor by being named International Senator in 1975. Jimmy moved on to become the president of the Abbeville Chamber of Commerce in 1975 and 1976. During his tenure, the Chamber saw unprecedented growth and one of the largest memberships in the history of the organization. Jimmy was a member of the Abbeville Lions Club and a former member of the Abbeville Kiwanis Club. He also served for eight years on the Abbeville Recreation Board, two of those as chairman. No one would dispute the fact that he played a vital role in the development of these various organizations and the entire business community of Abbeville. 
Jimmy also achieved notoriety with his impressive political achievements. He was first elected Mayor of Abbeville in 1988 and was currently serving in his third term. He was vice-president of the Board of Directors of the Southeast Alabama Regional Landfill Authority. He served dutifully on the Board of the Southeast Alabama Gas District for ten years, taking the position of chairman in 1995. He was active in the Alabama League of Municipalities as a member of the Executive Committee, and achieved the high honor of being a certified municipal official. Jimmy was extremely proud of his accomplishments as Mayor, most recently working with my office to secure important transportation and downtown revitalization grants. 
Remarkably, Jimmy's business and political successes did not take away from his other devotions. Jimmy was a man with unwavering religious beliefs that led to a life of teaching the word of God. He was a charter member of the Calvary Baptist Church of Abbeville, where he served for 36 years. During this time, Jimmy served in a variety of capacities for the Church, including the post of chairman of the deacons for four terms, as well as Sunday School superintendent and teacher. Along with these responsibilities, Jimmy was the founding director of the Abbeville Christian Academy and served on its Board of Directors for many years. During his time involved with the Calvary Baptist Church and the Abbeville Christian Academy, Jimmy had the opportunity to help shape the lives of the children whom he taught and provided them with a firm groundwork in morality and Christianity which will help to guide them through life. 
From his youth, Jimmy was also an avid sports fan. Having played football for Coach Bobby Bowden at Howard College, his competitive spirit never faltered. He was a former coach of the Abbeville Christian Academy Pee Wee Generals, and freely gave of his time to coach various teams in the Abbeville Recreation Department. He also was an avid Auburn University fan, from where his two daughters, Lil and Fran, graduated. 
James Francis `Jimmy' Crawford will be remembered as a devoted husband and father. He will be missed by all who knew him, especially his wife Jo Smith Crawford; his daughters Lillian Ella Crawford, of Birmingham; and Martha Frances Crawford, of Abbeville; and other relatives and many friends whose lives he touched. 
I will truly miss Jimmy. His many accomplishments touched the lives of every citizen of Abbeville and beyond. He should be remembered as a man with great vision and leadership. My heart is with his family during this difficult time.

Mr. SHELBY. I know that the Senator from Vermont is quite familiar with the work of the State Humanities Councils and he is aware of the extensive number of teacher institutes which they have supported over the past few years. In Virginia, for example, the council has sponsored teacher institutes on local and regional history. The Alabama Humanities Foundation's SUPER (School and University Partners for Educational Renewal) reached more than 800 Alabama teachers over a two year period.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President I rise today to pay tribute to an Alabama couple who, in their persistent pursuit of justice, successfully raised awareness of illegal activities taking place in Marengo County in some of the highest levels of county government. Goodloe and Jean Sutton, who together head The Democrat-Reporter--Goodloe serves as editor and publisher and Jean as chief reporter--remind us of what the Fourth Estate is all about. Through their thorough and diligent coverage of questionable activities in the Marengo County Sheriff's office, former Sheriff Roger Davis was convicted on federal extortion charges; Sonny Breckenridge, who had been appointed by Sheriff Davis to lead the county's drug enforcement unit, was sentenced to life without parole for conspiring to protect drug dealers. Another deputy was also arrested. All are serving jail time for the deeds the Suttons helped to uncover. 
Goodloe and Jean Sutton are to be commended. Not only have they helped to rid the Marengo County Sheriff's office of misdeeds and rampant corruption, but they have helped to restore the public faith in local government. They have also set an exemplary standard for others in the profession of journalism where truth should always be the highest and most important pursuit and consideration. 
In addition to my statement, Mr. President, I believe it is fitting to include the following article about the Suttons, entitled `Paper Tigers,' that appeared in the September 28, 1998 edition of People Magazine.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an award-winning Alabama journalist and author who has written the definitive history of the World War II military career of Hollywood-great Jimmy Stewart. Mr. Smith, who served with Stewart in WWII, wrote `A Retrospective of the World War II Military Career of Hollywood's James M. (Jimmy) Stewart' for the James M. Stewart Museum Foundation, located in Stewart's hometown--Indiana, PA. I believe excerpts from this article are a fitting tribute to both the life and legacy of a true American hero: Jimmy Stewart, as well as to one of Alabama's fine authors: Starr Smith. In compliance with the Congressional Record text-length rules, only excerpts of Mr. Smith's article could be placed in the Record; however, I encourage my colleagues and the American people to obtain a complete copy of this important article from either the James M. Stewart Museum or the September 1998 edition of The Retired Officers Magazine. 
In addition to his many accomplishments, Smith is a travel columnist for the Montgomery Advertiser and is a retired Air Force Reserve colonel. He lives in Montgomery, AL. 
Mr. President, the following are excerpts from `A Retrospective of the World War II Military Career of Hollywood's James M. (Jimmy) Stewart' by Starr Smith:  
When the melancholy news came of Jimmy Stewart's death I was in Montreal, Canada. I thought it singular that I was out of my own country at the time because my relationship with this remarkable American had taken place on foreign soil--wartime England. Much has been said and written since Stewart's death about his extraordinary life and career as a film actor of the first rank, but little has been said about Stewart's brilliant and brave record as an Army Air Force combat pilot and commander in World War II. 
I served with Stewart on a windswept and cold bomber station, called Old Buckingham, near the North Sea between Cambridge and Norwich in England's East Anglia in 1943-1944. Our outfit was the 453rd Bomb Group. The commander, Colonel Ramsay Potts, was a battle-tested B-24 specialist who had been on the historic and pivotal Ploesti mission and earned the Distinguished Service Cross. Stewart, then a major, was the group's operations officer and I was an intelligence officer who handled much of the briefings for the air crews prior to their mission over Nazi Germany. It was in this capacity that I worked with Stewart, night after night, preparing the details of the mission. I have never known a more intelligent, knowledgeable, hardworking, conscientious and dedicated officer. 
In my book, `Only the Days Are Long: Reports of a Journalist and World Traveler,' I wrote of Stewart: `At night, working with me preparing the mission, Stewart was crisp and business-like; reserved, but he knew his job and was a keen student of daylight precision bombing. (The Americans bombed in daylight, the RAF at night). It was interesting to see Stewart at the bar of the Officer's Club after a tough day and hear his discussion of the mission with the returning pilots. But even then he was always slightly aloof. He was never one of the boys. This is not to say Stewart was unfriendly. Rather, he went about his work with a cool professional detachment--a single purpose approach that did not allow for personal involvement. This, I think, was the reason for this success in the war. He was determined to prove that he was more than an actor, more than a Hollywood star. He was determined to prove that now he could measure up as a man doing a really important job in the military crucible and not just a celluloid hero. 
Almost a year before Pearl Harbor, Jimmy Stewart had a deep feeling that his country would soon be at war. Stewart also knew that if war came he wanted to be in uniform and overseas on combat duty. 
At the beginning of the new year of 1941, Stewart was at the top of his career as a movie actor and international star. His 1939 picture, `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,' has made him a folk hero throughout America and he was destined for an Academy Award for his role as the reporter in `Philadelphia Story' later in the year. His life was blissful, romantic, flawless, and ahead was the golden promise of infinite stardom as one of the premier movie players of all time. 
. . . but with England fighting Hitler since 1939, Edward R. Murrow's bleak broadcasts from London, the Pacific war against the Japanese going badly for the British . . . Jimmy Stewart decided to join the fight. But, he faced two major roadblocks: his boss and his country. Louis B. Mayer, the forceful and dictatorial head of MGM used every persuasive tactic at his command--choice roles, contract revisions, free time to help with the war effort as a civilian. The other matter was different. 
In September of 1940, the Selective Service Act became law, and men between the ages of 21 and 36 were required to register. Being 32, Stewart registered . . . when he was called up for a physical in late 1940, he was turned down: underweight. That could have ended the whole affair. . . . perhaps thinking of his father's fierce patriotism and his service in two wars, plus his own fervent love of country, Stewart favored the volunteer route. He appealed the Army's underweight decision, embarked on an eating binge, made the weight requirements and reported for induction on March 22, 1941 at Fort McArthur, California. 
Stewart was among the very few officers in American military history to rise from private to full colonel in slightly over four years. Moreover, Stewart was actually on combat duty all the time he was overseas, performing vital, demanding and dangerous jobs: squadron operations officer, squadron commander, group operations officer, wing operations officer, and later at the end--Second Bomb Wing Commander. And, all the while, he was flying combat missions as a B-24 pilot and command pilot. 
. . . Stewart spent all of his service in England assigned to the 2nd Combat Wing. . . . in late August of 1945, he returned to New York on the Queen Elizabeth. And on September 29th of that year, Stewart was discharged at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington. He was immediately appointed a full colonel in the Air Force Reserve. In his war years, Stewart had flown 20 combat missions, among them the tough ones: Brunswick, Bremen, Frankfort, Schweinfut, and I recall that he was on Berlin twice--once leading the entire 1,000 plane 8th Air Force. His wartime decorations include: Distinguished Flying Cross, with Oak Leaf Cluster; four Air Medals, and the French Croix de Guerre with Palm. He was promoted to Brigadier General in the Air Force Reserve in 1959 and retired in 1968. After Stewart died in July of 1997, Air Power History published a memoriam . . . (which) contained this little-known fact: `In 1966, during his annual two weeks of active duty, Stewart requested a combat assignment and participated in a bombing strike over Vietnam.' 
. . . With all the myriad honors of a celebrated and eclectic career, including the highest in his profession--the Academy Award--it is not too much to believe that Jimmy Stewart reached the blue lawn of his life in those eventful and dangerous years of World War II. A small town boy who grew up with strong family values and a bed-rock foundation in honesty and integrity, intertwined with a fervent patriotism--Stewart served his country with dedication and distinction, and, like F. Scott Fitzgerald, his fellow Princetonian--he lived his life with an unbending determination, subtle style and a certain mystique.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to eulogize and celebrate the life of one of Alabama's great native sons--Dr. George Vernon Irons, Sr., who passed away July 21, 1998. 
Dr. Irons was Distinguished Professor of History and Political Science Emeritus at Samford University, having served the University for 43 years. During that time, he taught a record number of University Presidents, 17. 
Dr. Irons was the oldest member of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame and one of Alabama's athletic greats---the only Alabama track and distance star inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame from the University of Alabama. Mr. President, only three men have been inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame on the first ballot: Ralph Shug Jordan, Paul `Bear' Bryant, and Dr. George Irons. 
Dr. Irons is survived by his wife, Velma Wright Irons, a distinguished educator and nominee for the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame at Judson College; two sons: Dr. George Vernon Irons, Jr., a cardiologist in Charlotte, North Carolina; and William Lee Irons, a prominent Birmingham attorney. Dr. Irons and his son William are the only father and son to be selected for the 1998 Who's Who in America from Alabama. 
Mr. President, Dr. George Vernon Irons Sr., gave tirelessly of himself to God and country. He was a man of great distinction, and I take great pride in offering this tribute on his behalf. 
Mr. President, the following tribute, edited to meet Congressional Record length requirements, was written by Dr. Irons' son. It provides a comprehensive and detailed account of Dr. Irons' life and many accomplishments.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend Bertie Sweeney Gammell Parish, a lifelong resident of Clayton, Alabama, hardworking wife and mother, dedicated member of the community, newspaper professional, and an inspiration to all who knew her. Bertie passed away at her home on Wednesday, August 26, 1998. 
Born on June 4, 1915 in Dothan, Alabama, Bertie was the daughter of William Lee and Pearle Ennis Gammell. From her earliest beginnings, Bertie was an active member of the Clayton United Methodist Church where she combined her love of music with her service to God as organist and choir director for almost 50 years. Bertie held a bachelor's degree in music from Alabama College, teaching music briefly at Montgomery County High School and later in Clayton. 
A former member of the Eufaula Music Guild, Bertie was a Paul Harris fellow of the Rotary Foundation of Rotary International---an award presented by the Clayton Rotary Club, a lifetime member of the Alabama Federation of Garden Clubs and a member of the Clayton Garden Club. 
In addition to the many awards and community service position she held, Bertie is probably best known as the editor and publisher of The Clayton Record---a post she assumed in 1960 after the deaths of her father and later her mother---both held the position in consecutive terms before her. She passed this torch to her daughter Rebecca Parish Beasley who holds the position today. The Clayton Record is one of only a few remaining family-owned and operated newspapers. 
Bertie's column `One Comment,' which appeared on the front page of The Clayton Record, was a favorite of subscribers. From her astute observations on everything from politics to gardening, Bertie thrilled, inspired and delighted her readers, including local gardeners who hoped to receive mention in one of her columns. 
Bertie was well known not only in Clayton, but across Alabama. She received many awards and kudos from colleagues in the news business including a listing in Who's Who of American Women, and the News Media Service to Education Award. She was also a staunch preservationist who worked diligently to preserve history and local historic structures in and around Clayton. 
Despite a demanding schedule, Bertie never forgot what matters most: family and friends. She is survived by her husband Thomas William Parish, Sr: -to whom she would have been married for 59 years on August 30, 1998; three children: Dr. Thomas William Parish, Jr., of Geneva, Joseph Edward Parish, Sr., of Clayton; and Rebecca Parish Beasley of Clayton; six grandchildren: Joseph Edward Parish, Jr. of Montgomery; Lucile Martin Parish of Columbus, Georgia; Edna Elane Parish Gulledge of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Thomas Frank Kelly, Jr., of Montgomery; Rebecca Parish Kelly of Clayton; and Thomas William Parish, III, of Geneva; three great-grandchildren; other relatives and friends too numerous to mention. 
I will miss Bertie. She was a good friend for many years. My heart goes out to her family as they remember her love, her many accomplishments, and the important role she set for them and for others in and around Clayton, Alabama. My prayers are with you.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Aubrey `Cotton' Lake, a long-time friend and respected member of the Tuscaloosa community, who passed away on Friday, August 14, 1998 at the age of 69. 
Aubrey was a valued employee of the Tuscaloosa News for 18 years and traveled extensively with the Alabama Crimson Tide football team. His photographs of the team won him the coveted Look Magazine National Sports Photography award, and many of his photographs hang in Tuscaloosa's Coach Bear Bryant Museum. Aubrey captured many of the Crimson Tide images that have become emblazoned on our memories--from photographs of Bear Bryant coaching the team to victory, to Joe Namath before his tenure with the NFL. Aubrey was there, documenting sports history, shooting and selecting the most descriptive photographs for the next day's Tuscaloosa News sports page. 
Aubrey was more than a sports photographer, however, and served both God and country throughout his life. In addition to his active membership at the First Freewill Baptist Church of Tuscaloosa, he also served many of Alabama's elected officials. For more than 24 years, Aubrey worked for late Representatives Walter Flowers and Claude Harris, and most recently for me, on my own staff. 
More than just an employee, Aubrey was a friend and a confidant. He was loyal, had a lifetime of experience in Alabama, and was a true servant to the people of our state. I could never have asked for a more dedicated staff member or friend. 
After leaving public service, Aubrey worked as president of Tuscaloosa Insulation Company, and served as a member of the Tuscaloosa Home Builders Association. He was an avid sportsman, and attended as many Alabama football games as possible. 
Aubrey was a loving father, devoted community member, and friend to most anyone he met. He will be missed by all who knew him, especially his wife Dot, his daughter Suzanne, his son Greg, his grandchildren, and other family members and friends. 
I'm glad I had the opportunity to know and work with Aubrey Lake. He was a good friend, and I will miss him.

Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Majority Leader and my colleague from North Carolina and the Senator from Colorado, the Chairman of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, for their support. The Administration's resistance to providing the public access to federal research data not otherwise protected from disclosure under current law indeed contradicts the spirit of current law. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requests the Director of OMB to `foster greater sharing, dissemination, and access to public information.' OMB Circular 110, Subpart C, is even more specific, stating that unless specifically waived, Federal agencies `have the right to . . . obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award'. Unfortunately, these policy directives are not being implemented on a systematic basis. Given the prevalent use of government funded research data in developing regulations and federal policy, it is important that such data be made available to other interested Federal agencies and to the public on a routine basis for independent scientific evaluation and confirmation. I thank my colleagues for their support on this issue and I look forward to working with them to improve the language in Conference.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Dodd amendment, and my opposition is this: 
First, the Dodd amendment would give foreign organizations--foreign organizations--extraordinary statutory privileges to expedite and to compel declassification of U.S. national security information. Yes, it would give foreign organizations--not us--extraordinary statutory privileges to expedite and compel declassification of U.S. national security information, something that we have not ever had. 
Creating such statutory rights, which the Dodd amendment, if it is adopted and becomes law, will do, also opens the door to foreign organizations to take intelligence, law enforcement, defense and foreign policy agencies to court to compel special declassification requests. 
Second, to complete the review of the numerous documents that fall under this amendment in just 4 months--4 months--agencies will be forced to reassign personnel, many of whom would otherwise be carrying out important mission functions, or risk being sued by foreign organizations for noncompliance. Imagine that, think about this, I ask my colleagues this afternoon. 
Third, this amendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut is woefully inadequate in protecting intelligence sources and methods and, as a result, will chill current and future sources from providing the CIA with critical information--the very information that policymakers need to address human rights and other important foreign policy issues in many countries. 
Fourth, the Dodd amendment applies the same standards for withholding information that are being used to declassify records relating to the JFK assassination. The JFK records are over 40 years old. The documents covered by this amendment are much newer, some only a year old. Because the privacy, law enforcement and intelligence concerns are much greater in newer documents, there is no reason for the standards to be any different than those set out in President Clinton's Executive Order No. 12958. Otherwise, we risk jeopardizing ongoing prosecutions, losing critical intelligence sources and methods, and releasing private information. 
Mr. President, while we have previously enacted declassification exceptions for other historical records, special statutory authority to expedite and compel declassification of records should be exclusively reserved for American citizens, not foreign entities. 
The intelligence community has informed the Intelligence Committee in the Senate that it expects that substantial litigation costs will result if the amendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut becomes law. 
Litigation costs can be approximately 100 times as much per case than processing information for declassification and usually results in little, if any, additional information being released. Just think about it, Mr. President. Think about how far this amendment will go. 
Finally, the Dodd amendment is an unfunded mandate. Agencies would be required to pay for this declassification requirement out of existing funds. I understand that there are only a limited number of personnel with the necessary expertise to review and to declassify our intelligence records. As a result, resources spent on reviewing documents for the foreign organizations under this amendment, if it were adopted, will no longer be available to process declassification requests for others--including many U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens with equally meritorious requests for information will have to stand aside while these foreign entities go to the front of the line. 
In the fiscal year 1998, Mr. President, Congress funded a special declassification program to review and to declassify many of these documents. Since this amendment changes the standards for withholding information, the intelligence community will have to re-review the documents that the taxpayers have already paid to review. 
Mr. President, at the proper time I would hope that we would table this amendment, especially until we have an opportunity to fully consider its impact on the intelligence community and the Departments of State, Defense and Justice, as well as the American people. 
I think this amendment has not been well thought out. I know it has not been debated at length yet. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Ernest A. Young on the occasion of his retirement from the Department of the Army. Throughout his 40 years of Federal Service, culminating in his current position as Deputy to the Commanding General, U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, Mr. Young has distinguished himself time and time again as an individual of the utmost integrity, capability, and foresight. 
Mr. Young began his career as an Army civilian employee in 1958, as a technical program specialist. He held managerial positions for various missile programs, including the very successful HAWK missile. Twenty-three years later, in September 1981, he was appointed to the Senior Executive Service where he held several key command and staff positions with the U.S. Army Missile Command. 
Mr. Young continued to rise through the ranks, and in June 1993, he was the first civilian to be selected as the Deputy to the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Missile Command (MICOM). In this position, Mr. Young was responsible for achieving all of the command's missions. Due in large part to his leadership, MICOM maintained a high state of readiness by adhering to procurement schedules and successfully executing weapons development programs despite the enormous challenge posed by shrinking annual defense budgets. Mr. Young's dedication to efficiency was recognized as MICOM became the first major subordinate command of the Army Materiel Command to be designated as a Reinvention Laboratory. Though faced with funding shortages, his skills also enabled him to implement several human resource initiatives that obviated the need for a reduction in force during his tenure as Deputy to the MICOM Commander. 
Mr. Young, however, may best be remembered for his personal attention to the implementation of the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure decision to consolidate the U.S. Army Aviation and Troop Command (ATCOM) with MICOM at Redstone Arsenal. The fact that 55 percent of ATCOM's aviation managerial workforce successfully moved to Redstone serves as a testament to Mr. Young's leadership and professionalism during this transition. 
Since the formation of the Aviation and Missile Command, Mr. Young has continued in his role as Deputy to the Commanding General. While the AMCOM formally merged the various aspects of aviation and missile program management into a single commodity command, Mr. Young diligently worked to integrate the aviation and missile cultures. He continued to work closely with the Commanding General to ensure the uninterrupted accomplishment of the procurement, readiness, and materiel development missions and functions of the command. 
In addition to Mr. Young's exemplary career, his frequent participation in seminars and workshops designed for senior government executives demonstrated his continual desire to better himself and improve his technical and managerial capabilities. Moreover, Mr. Young's involvement in such noteworthy associations as the American Society of Military Comptrollers, American Institute of Physics, Society of Logistics Engineers, the American Society for Public Administration and Rotary Club, exemplify his steadfast commitment to professional improvement and civic duty. 
Mr. President, for 40 years, Ernest Young has been an asset to the U.S. Army, Alabama, and the nation. On behalf of the United States Senate and a grateful nation, I thank Mr. Young for his dedicated service as he closes one chapter in his life and begins another.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, there has been a lot said about the amendment that we have offered to exempt small banks from the Community Reinvestment Act. A popular mantra is that if the small bank exemption amendment passes, President Clinton will veto the bill; therefore, the Senate should not take up this amendment. I have also been told this is not the time or the place to take up an amendment to CRA. But I believe, Mr. President, that such assertions are not valid. 
H.R. 1151 essentially eliminates the common bond requirement, allowing credit unions to serve virtually any and every group now. 
In addition, H.R. 1151 explicitly authorizes credit unions to perform commercial lending activities. In doing so, this Congress is overturning a historical Supreme Court decision and the law of the land for about 60 years. While expanding the role of credit unions, we continue to protect the tax exemption credit unions now enjoy. 
Small community banks, Mr. President, however, serve the local community but have to compete with the higher cost of funds, a higher regulatory burden, and of course a considerable tax burden. While we increase the competitive advantage of small bank competitors in this bill, we do nothing to help small banks compete on a more level playing field. 
So, Mr. President, for those who suggest that this is not the time or the place for this amendment to exempt the small banks of America from the CRA, I have to disagree. Credit unions are increasing their market share over community banks in small local markets with higher savings rates and lower lending rates, rates small banks cannot match thanks to the tax and regulatory burdens that constitute the competitive disadvantage here. The small bank exemption from the Community Reinvestment Act has everything to do with the competitive equity we are talking about--leveling the playing field between local community banks and credit unions. 
The President, of course, has the right to veto a bill if he so chooses. That is the legislative process. We all know that. However, I do not believe the President would veto this bill if this amendment were part of it. The Senate Banking Committee worked very hard to draft a responsible bill, and, by and large, I think we did just that. Nevertheless, Mr. President, I believe H.R. 1151, the bill before us now, can be improved. And, to that extent, this is the time and this is the place to improve the bill. 
Yesterday, the Senate failed to table Senator Gramm's amendment to strike the community-reinvestment-like provisions on credit unions from the bill. I supported that. As a result, it appears the Senate has chosen to adopt Senator Gramm's amendment to eliminate the expansion of regulatory burden and mandated credit allocation on to credit unions, which I think is good. 
If the Senate votes to table the small bank exemption from CRA, the Senate will make a very hypocritical policy statement to the American people, I believe, saying, essentially, that we do not support the expansion of mandated credit allocation and regulatory burden on credit unions, but, Mr. President, on the other hand, we do support the mandated credit allocation and regulatory burden on small community banks. Now that is not what we call competitive equity. 
I believe the worst part about this inconsistent policy is that consumers are the ones who bear the brunt of the cost of the Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA tax on banks only gets passed on to the consumer. While the intention, Mr. President, of the Community Reinvestment Act may have been to help consumers, in practice I believe it hurts them. CRA is bad for consumers. CRA is, I believe, bad public policy. 
Contrary to what opponents of the amendment would have you believe, the small bank exemption would not gut CRA. Banks with less than $250 million in assets account for less than 12 percent of bank assets nationwide. This is a vote for small community banks in America. I think it is time to do it and the time is now.

Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, this amendment that I have offered this afternoon would authorize a small bank exemption in the Government-mandated credit requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act, known as CRA. Community banks by their very nature serve the needs of their communities. They do not need, I believe, a burdensome Government mandate to force them to allocate credit or to originate profitable loans. 
Friday, I spoke in this Chamber about the regulatory burden of the CRA on small community banks in the United States. I cited then statistics that show small banks are less efficient than large institutions and suffer from excessive regulations. 
My colleagues should know that the amendment I have just offered would exempt only 11.2 percent of bank assets nationwide. This is nearly the same amount of assets as one of the largest financial institutions in America, BankAmerica. Can you imagine that? All the small banks of America, with $250 million in deposits or assets or less, have 11.2 percent of the assets, and one bank, and probably several others, has a lot more than all of these banks put together.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, something was said just a minute ago about the threat of a veto by the President. I have heard this a lot on different bills. But I know the process should work. Especially when you have a principle that you believe in and that you know is right, you should not step aside because someone intimates that they might veto it. That is part of the legislative process. 
Mr. President, having said that, later in the debate--probably Monday when we get back--I will be offering an amendment to the bill dealing with the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. My proposed amendment would authorize a small bank exemption from the Government-mandated credit requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act, which Senator Gramm from Texas so eloquently talked about earlier this morning. Community banks, as you well know, as a Senator and present Presiding Officer, by their very nature, serve the needs of their community. 
They do not need a burdensome, government mandate to force them to allocate credit or originate profitable loans. Make no mistake about it. Community banks would not exist very long if they didn't take care of the whole community; and they do. 
Since H.R. 1151 increases the competitive advantage credit unions have over banks, we feel this amendment is necessary to reduce the inequities in this area and allow our small community banks to better meet the needs of consumers. 
Nine members of the Banking Committee sponsored a small bank exemption amendment to H.R. 1151 in the committee markup. The amendment resulted in a tie vote of nine to nine. The nine members of the committee that supported the amendment felt so strongly about the small bank exemption, that all nine members signed a statement of additional views to the committee report, which is unusual. 
Let me say from the start, CRA is a tax on community banks, CRA raises the costs of inputs to banks by increasing their regulatory burden and compliance costs. In addition, CRA forces banks to make loans according to a federal quota, increasing the risks, and therefore the costs, of borrowing to consumers. Make no mistake about it, the Community Reinvestment Act raises the cost of borrowing through higher loan rates and punishes savers in the form of lower savings rates. Congress I believe should adopt policies that lowers the cost of borrowing, and my amendment would do that. 
I would also point out that the federal government does not know the demand for loans any better than the local banker. CRA preempts the free market lending criteria of community banks and imposes the judgment of federal bureaucrats. CRA is government mandated credit allocation, the form of credit allocation that has proven disastrous most recently in east Asia. We have an opportunity to reduce the scope of government mandated credit allocation with this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do so. 
I want to revisit, and give a little history contextually.  
HISTORY 
When the Community Reinvestment Act was introduced in 1977, the bill's chief sponsor and chairman of the Banking Committee, William Proxmire stated: 
The authority to operate new deposit facilities is given away, free, to successful applicants even though the authority conveys a substantial economic benefit to the applicant. Those who obtain new deposit facilities receive a semi-exclusive franchise to do business in a particular geographic area. The Government limits the entry of other potential competitors into that area if such entry would unduly jeopardize existing financial institutions. The Government also restricts competition and the cost of money to the bank by limiting the rate of interest payable on savings deposits and prohibiting any interest on demand deposits. 
Senator Proxmire later said: 
The regulators have thus conferred substantial economic benefits on private institutions without extracting any meaningful quid pro quo for the public. 
REVIEW 
The central premise on which Senator Proxmire bases his justification for `extracting any meaningful quid pro quo' may have existed in 1977, but absolutely does not exist today. Taken one at a time, each and every claim Senator Proxmire used to justify CRA in 1977 is no longer applicable today. Let us go through them one at a time: 
Chartered institutions `receive a semi-exclusive franchise to do business in a particular geographic area.' 
Congress passed the Reigle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which allowed one bank to acquire another bank in any other state, thus subjecting small community banks to the competition of acquisition hungry megabanks. 
Senator Proxmire also said: 
`Government limits the entry of other potential competitors.' 
That was in 1977. 
Clearly this is not the case. The underlying bill, H.R. 1151 does not limit, but dramatically increases the entry of potential competitors. 
The bill essentially says that credit unions can serve every group in a community--making them the same as community banks. 
Senator Proxmire said in 1977 regarding CRA justification: 
`Government also restricts competition and the cost of money to the bank by limiting the rate of interest payable on savings deposits and prohibiting any interest on demand deposits.' 
This is no longer true. 
The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 phased out the interest rate ceilings on savings deposits and introduced Negotiable Orders of Withdrawals (NOW Accounts) that allowed the payment of interest on demand deposits to consumers.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, in putting together the Fiscal Year 1999 Transportation Appropriations bill, we were faced with the difficulty of trying to adhere to the spending levels in the new highway and transit authorization bill and still provide adequate levels of funding for other transportation priorities. We have done that in this bill, and I think it represents a balanced approach to meeting our nation's transportation needs. I want to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations Senator Stevens, for all his assistance and advice as we put this bill together and moved it through sub and full committee consideration. 
We have also worked diligently with the senior Senator from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, the ranking minority member of the subcommittee on transportation appropriations, 
and with the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations, Senator Byrd, to try to accommodate the requests of every Member of the Senate. No one got everything they asked for, but I think as Members look at the details of the bill, they will see that we did our best, with the limited resources we had, to accommodate everyone's request. 
I want to outline just a few highlights of the bill, if I may. 
The Airport Improvement Program is set at $2.1 billion for 1999, the highest level ever. This funding will expand the capacity of our Nation's airports, reduce delays and congestion, and, most importantly, it will improve aviation safety in America. As the demand for air travel increases, we must ensure that our airports are able to efficiently handle traffic that will come with it. 
Highway spending is also at the highest level in history--more than $27 billion. This funding will help States clear out their backlog of overdue highway construction and improvement projects. With more than 40,000 American lives lost each year on our Nation's highways, we must do everything to make them as safe as possible. Highway spending not only improves safety but also will provide good jobs for thousands of Americans. 
I believe we have adequately funded both the Coast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration operations accounts, and we have provided increased flexibility for the Secretary to manage both operations accounts to meet air traffic control and drug interdiction demands. 
I am pleased that we were able to fully appropriate the authorized levels for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That agency's funding in this bill represents an 8 percent increase over last year and will aid in their efforts to conduct airbag research, develop automatic crash avoidance technologies, and increase seatbelt use, and also reduce drunk driving on our highways. 
The Federal Transit Administration will receive $5.365 billion, an 11 percent increase from 1998. These funds will be used to build new light rail transit systems, replace dilapidated public buses, and construct intermodal facilities to speed the transfer of people from one transportation mode to another. 
Regarding Amtrak, the bill provides an additional $555 million on top of the $1.1 billion Amtrak will receive from the Taxpayer Relief Act that we passed last year. 
My concerns about the level of Federal subsidies for Amtrak are well known in this body. Since the railroad was created in 1971, Amtrak has received $21 billion in Federal support. That is an average of $750 million a year. Mr. President, that is a disproportionately high level of subsidy for a railroad that only serves 20 million intercity passengers every year. Mr. President, by way of comparison, 600 million Americans fly every year. This means that more people fly in a 2-week period than ride Amtrak over the course of the year. The bill before you this evening contains a provision requiring Amtrak to print the per-passenger subsidy on each Amtrak ticket sold. According to the GAO, Amtrak loses an average of $47 per passenger. I think the American people have a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me comment on the Project Labor agreement provision. At full committee consideration of the transportation appropriations bill, the chairman requested that we postpone the debate on this provision until the floor. I believe that the chairman's position to postpone this debate until the floor made sense. And I know that he has been working to resolve this issue in a fashion that will allow the transportation appropriations bill to move expeditiously through the Senate. I will continue to work with the chairman and with Members on both sides of this issue to see if we can craft--and I believe we will be able to craft--a solution that is workable for everyone involved. The intent of the original language in the bill was to prohibit discrimination against any worker in this country simply because he or she chooses not to join a union. 
Mr. President, I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish in this bill. I believe it will benefit all Americans by improving transportation services in this country. I look forward to working with the members of the committee and the Members of the Senate to move this bill through the Senate.  
Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.

Mr. SHELBY. The FAA contract tower program has been proven to be a very cost-effective way for the FAA and local airports to work as partners to improve air traffic safety in many smaller communities. In fact, the Department of Transportation Inspector General recently determined that the program provides quality air traffic control services at a lower cost compared to the FAA. This cost-sharing program would enable some airports that fall just below the eligibility criteria for a contract tower to retain their air traffic control services by paying for a share of the costs. The Committee believes that this program will improve aviation safety in small communities at a minimal expense to the FAA.

The Senator has been very active in keeping the subcommittee informed on the progress of the expansion at RSW. Because of this, I am well aware of the intense growth that this airport has experienced over the past several years. 
Likewise, I am aware of the efforts of RSW to work with the FAA in developing an LOI request, and that this effort has resulted in a substantial reduction in their request, making it reasonable within today's budget environment. I believe the behavior and efforts exhibited by RSW in working with the FAA, as well as their established need, are exactly the sorts of things the FAA should be looking for when considering LOI requests. Accordingly, I encourage the FAA to give priority consideration to RSW's request for a Letter of Intent.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise because I have concerns about efforts to ease or remove export restrictions on certain hardware and software encryption products. Export controls on encryption and on other products serve a clearly defined purpose--to protect our nation's security. The Intelligence Committee believes that the effects on U.S. national security must be the paramount concern when considering any proposed change to encryption export policy, and the Committee will seek referral of any legislation regarding encryption export policy under its jurisdiction established under Senate Resolution 400. With our on-going investigation into the possible technology transfers to China, the Vice Chairman and I are also concerned that any effort to change U.S. export policy on encryption be consistent with the export policy review included in our investigation. 
Export restrictions on encryption products assist the Intelligence Community in its signals intelligence mission. By collecting and analyzing signals intelligence, U.S. intelligence agencies seek to understand the policies, intentions, and plans of foreign state and nonstate actors. Signals intelligence plays an important role in the formation of American foreign and defense policy. It is also a significant factor in the U.S. efforts to protect its citizens and armed forces against terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, narcotics trafficking, international crime and other threats to our nation's security. 
While the Committee recognizes the commercial interest in easing or removing export restrictions, it believes the safety of our citizens and armed forces should be the predominant concern when considering U.S. policy towards the export of any product. The Committee supports the continued control of encryption products, and believes that a comprehensive strategy on encryption export policy can be developed that addresses national security concerns as well as the promotion of American commercial interests abroad. 
I look forward to working with Senator Lott and others as legislation moves through the Senate.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today the Senator from Arkansas takes his final shot at terminating funding for the International Space Station. For the eighth consecutive year, he argues that America should abandon its commitment as the leader of this historic endeavor. 
The Space Station is real and well on its way to orbit. Last year, NASA employees and contractors at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama finished construction of Node 1, the first significant piece of flight hardware. Since then, the Pressurized Mating Adapters, Integrated Electrical Assembly, Z1 Truss, Long Spacer, FGB Control Module are being prepared for integration tests and launch. 
Those who do not believe that America should maintain its leadership in space exploration speak only of the expense of building man's next great adventure of the space age. While I also am concerned about cost overruns and Russian participation, it is reasonable to expect some unforeseen costs given the complexity of the station. The critics also fail to mention that past funding for the space station now exceeds proposed future investment. More than 50 percent of the costs have been paid, and more than 80 percent of the development will be complete by the end of the current fiscal year. It does not make sense to abort this mission at this time. 
It goes without saying that termination of the International Space Station will undermine the credibility of the United States with its international partners who have already invested nearly $10 billion. The other nations participating in the development of the space station reaffirmed their commitment by signing partner agreements in January 1998. At the same time, the U.S. has taken the lead in developing the space station and have made commitments to the international community to see it through. Leadership requires resolve and character. It is not in the American nature to break our promises and abandon our friends and partners, especially when we are on the verge of launching the first elements of the space station. 
Continued development of the space station is the right course for the United States to take. The history of mankind, and especially of Americans, is one of curiosity and exploration. The same pioneer spirit that led past generations to explore the frontiers has manifest itself in our present journey to space. The United States is the undisputed leader in space technology development, and it would be arbitrary and reckless for the Senate to reject our destiny of discovery through the space station. I ask my colleagues to join me in reaffirming our country's commitment to our future by opposing this shortsighted attempt to strip funding from the space station.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 2052, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, to authorize appropriations for intelligence-related activities and programs of the United States Government. This important legislation was reported favorably out of the Committee on May 7, 1998, by unanimous vote, consistent with the long-standing, bipartisan nature of the Select Committee on Intelligence. 
Following receipt of the President's budget, the Select Committee undertook a thorough review of the budget request for intelligence for fiscal year 1999. That review was informed, in part, by several hearings and briefings as well as the findings and recommendations of a group of outside experts--known as the Technical Advisory Group--that the distinguished Vice Chairman of the Committee, Senator Kerrey, and I tasked last December to address key questions facing the Community. 
In addition, the Committee staff recently completed indepth audits and reviews of the use of `cover' by the Central Intelligence Agency and the administration of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. These reviews and audits led to Committee action with respect to the authorities, applicable laws, and budget of the activity or program concerned. 
As a product of these reviews, the Committee came to some rather startling and disconcerting conclusions about the overall health and direction of the Intelligence Community. For example: 
First, the CIA's foremost mission of providing timely intelligence based on human sources (`HUMINT') is in grave jeopardy. CIA case officers today do not have the training or the equipment needed to keep their true identities hidden, to communicate covertly with agents, or to plant sophisticated listening devices and other collection tools that will provide timely intelligence on an adversary's intentions. 
Second, what many see as the `crown jewel' of U.S. Intelligence--the National Security Agent's SIGINT capability--likewise is in dire need of modernization. The digital and fiber-optic revolutions are here-and-now, but NSA is still predominantly oriented toward Cold War-era threats. The Director of NSA, Lieutenant General Kenneth Minihan, has recommended major changes in how NSA performs its vital mission--changes our Committee endorses--but these changes were not reflected in the President's budget request. 
Third, promising technologies and systems for detecting missiles and other threats have been short-changed in the budget request. Likewise, robust funding for new tools for conducting information warfare, new sensors to detect and counter proliferation, and moving to smaller and cheaper satellites to support the war-fighter are not included in the budget request. 
And fourth, the quality of analysis within the Intelligence Community is poor and getting worse. Responding to the failure to predict the Indian nuclear tests, the Director of Central Intelligence commissioned retired Admiral David Jeremiah to review what went wrong and why. Among other findings, Admiral Jeremiah concluded that intelligence community analysts were complacent; they based their analyses on faulty assumptions; and engaged in wishful thinking. It is my belief that such is the state of analysis as it relates to many issues and problems, including political-military developments in China, the ballistic missile threat, and more. We can and should expect more from the Intelligence Community. 
The Intelligence Community has been forced by budgetary pressures to choose between funding current operations (such as Bosnia) and investing in the future. This is the case even after personnel reductions of over 20 percent in the Intelligence Community have been made over the past decade. In many ways, then, the problem confronting U.S. Intelligence is similar to that confronting the Department of Defense: How to pay for the necessary investments in future, `winning-edge' capabilities when the policymakers emphasize current operations? And, equally important, how to sustain the quality of life and skills-level of personnel who are already stretched thin by high operations tempo and lengthy overseas deployments? 
To address these challenges, Senator Kerrey and I tasked 
the staff to find and cut any and all poorly justified or redundant programs out of the budget. And, in fact, significant cuts were made to a wide range of lower-priority intelligence programs and activities. If it was poorly justified, redundant, or low-priority, then we cut it. These actions are entirely consistent with our oversight responsibilities, and the American people would expect no less. 
The Select Committee then took those funds and applied them against the highest priority intelligence needs and targets. Earlier this year, Senator Kerrey and I prepared intelligence budget guidance to direct the staff's budget work. That guidance emphasized the need for strengthened investment in areas such as advanced research and development, counter-proliferation, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, personnel training, information operations, effective covert action, and enhanced analysis. These are precisely the areas the Committee has historically supported and the keys to future intelligence successes--whether to support military commanders, policymakers in Washington, or American diplomats. 
This approach of cutting low-priority projects and redirecting those funds into high-payoff, futuristic technologies and systems, is fiscally responsible and reflects the need for difficult choices in an era of scarce resources. 
This budget is full of tough choices. For example, the Committee recommended cutting certain `legacy' programs and activities at NSA in order to pay for the collection systems and processes of the future, as recommended in General Minihan's study of the future SIGINT architecture needs (the `Unified Cryptologic Architecture'). Likewise, the Committee recommended cutting the number of CIA contractors, and reduced spending on costly infrastructure programs. 
None of these actions were easy--and in fact I am concerned that the Select Committee may have cut the intelligence budget too deeply in order to reach agreement with the Senate Armed Services Committee. That being said, this legislation is sound, it is balanced, and it is worthy of strong bipartisan support. 
My colleagues and the American people must come to understand that to save lives on the battlefield, to preclude terrorist attacks against Americans, to root out spies in our midst, and to give diplomats the information they need to forestall conflict in the first place, we need an effective, revitalized Intelligence Community. And that it is precisely what the Intelligence Authorization Act seeks to do. 
In summary, the Select Committee made the tough choices. We cut programs in order to invest in the future. We concluded that the intelligence budget can be cut, but it must be done in a careful, precise way, and based on specific programmatic recommendations. And we did it in a fully bipartisan manner. 
I applaud and appreciate the efforts of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, and all the Members of the Committee, who labored long and hard on this bill. It is one of the most important pieces of legislation this body will consider this year, and I urge its passage. 
Pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement, the Armed Services Committee has been discharged from consideration of the Intelligence Authorization Bill. Although the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee and I had previously agreed that the Armed Services Committee would not report the Intelligence Authorization Bill until three days following completion of Senate Floor consideration of the Defense Authorization Bill, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee has informed me that his committee has completed its review of the Intelligence Authorization Bill and does not recommend any amendments. We agree that it is appropriate for the Senate to consider the intelligence Authorization Bill at this time. We also agree, however, that this unanimous consent agreement to discharge the Armed Services Committee from further review of the Intelligence Authorization Bill will not serve as a precedent for requiring the Armed Services Committee to report future Intelligence Authorization Bills until it has had an adequate amount of time to review such legislation.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this Amendment will add a section to the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 that will designate the headquarters building of the Central Intelligence Agency as the `George Herbert Walker Bush Center for Central Intelligence.' 
I believe that this is a fitting tribute to a man that has had a remarkable and distinguished career in public service not only as President, but also as Vice President, Member of Congress, U.N. Ambassador, the Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office to the Peoples' Republic of China, and Director of Central Intelligence. 
President Bush, of course, is the only Director of Central Intelligence to become President of the United States. 
I know that he has always been particularly proud of his tenure as the Director of Central Intelligence. I also know that he guided the Agency through a difficult time and continues to be held in high regard by not only CIA employees, but also the Intelligence Community at large. 
Currently, the headquarters building at Langley does not have a formal name and this would be the only facility in the Washington, D.C. area named after President Bush. This amendment has been cleared on both sides and I urge its immediate adoption.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Michael E. Stephens, the founder of ReLife, Inc., a nation-wide rehabilitation system, and the namesake of the Michael E. Stephens College of Business at the University of Montevallo in Alabama. Mr. Stephens is a remarkable man, a distinguished citizen and a leader in the field of health care and physical rehabilitation. 
Mr. Stephens was born and raised in Alabama and began attending the University of Montevallo in 1962. However, his path through college was a long, complicated one. Though Michael Stephens is today a highly successful entrepreneur, recognized for his many accomplishments and his generous civic spirit, his first attempt at college was incomplete! Instead, Mr. Stephens left the University in 1966 for a series of jobs in the insurance industry. Several years later, at the age of 26, he broke his neck in a horrible diving accident. Despite being told he would never walk again, with extensive rehabilitation--and steely determination--Michael Stephens overcame the most significant obstacle of his life. Amazingly, he fully recovered in less than a year, and almost ten years after he had begun his college education, Mr. Stephens returned to the University of Montevallo. 
Michael Stephens received his undergraduate degree in business from the University of Montevallo in 1973 and his Master's Degree in 1975 from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He went to work in rehabilitative services for the Lakeshore Rehabilitation Hospital. Based upon his own experience, Mr. Stephens was committed to providing comprehensive services and quality care to people with physical disabilities. Under his leadership, Lakeshore Hospital became a world-class rehabilitative center. By introducing new rehabilitative services, such as speech therapy, recreational programs, psychological counseling and outpatient job training, Mr. Stephens created a new way of dealing with disability. In fact, Forbes Magazine said, `Stephens turned little Lakeshore into a model laboratory for his idea about rehabilitation.' In the mid-1980's, he founded the Lakeshore Foundation, a non-profit organization designed to assist people with physical disabilities. Specifically, the Foundation focused on training athletes. Almost overnight, Mr. Stephens' athletic program grew. Lakeshore's athletes went on to become among the most successful in the paralympics: breaking records in all events and winning numerous gold, silver and bronze medals. His successful approach to rehabilitation led to his founding of ReLife, a publicly-traded national health-services corporation, in 1986. 
Through ReLife, Mr. Stephens realized his dream of reinventing rehabilitation. By 1992, ReLife ran over forty rehabilitation facilities. In 1994, when ReLife merged with HealthSouth Corporation, Michael Stephens focused his attention and considerable talents on other needs of his community. He became a member of the board of trustees of the Alabama Symphony Orchestra and the Naples, Florida Philharmonic Center for the Arts. Additionally, he is a former member of both the President's Committee on Hiring the Handicapped and the National Association of Rehabilitation Facilities and is active in the Alabama State Health Coordinating Council. Mr. Stephens' business prowess is not limited to rehabilitation: he also owns several car dealerships, a real estate development company and a champion horse breeding farm. 
His leadership was recognized by the University of Montevallo in 1995, when he was awarded the Doctor of Humane Letters. Mr. Stephens serves as a member of the Board of Trustees of the University, and recently donated one million dollars to their capital funds campaign. 
As a result of business endeavors, community service, philanthropic projects and long-standing support for higher education, on October 9, 1997, the University of Montevallo honored Mr. Stephens by deciding to re-name the business school the Michael E. Stephens College of Business. The citation issued by the University's Board of Trustees stated: `His leadership and service deserve lasting recognition and are worthy of holding as exemplary to this and future generations of Montevallo students, faculty, alumni and friends.' Mr. Stephens has promised to remain very active in the Stephens College of Business, and I believe that all of the current and future Montevallo students will benefit greatly from his involvement. 
On that day last year, Michael Stephens, loved and respected by all who have known him, was honored as a friend and leader to not only the University of Montevallo, but all the citizens of Alabama. I, too, want to honor Mr. Stephen's example of strength, vision, courage and community spirit. On behalf of my wife, Annette, an alumna of the University of Montevallo, we wish Michael Stephens our sincerest thanks and congratulations for his dedication to making a difference.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a great Alabamian and a great American whose life was cut short by war--Lieutenant James Edwin `Jimmy' Walker. I did not have the pleasure of knowing Jimmy, but many people from my home state who knew this young man have nothing but praise for him. 
Born in 1913, Jimmy became one of the most outstanding athletes in the history of Holt High School. He was the captain of the football, baseball, and basketball teams, leading his small school to athletic prominence in the state. Jimmy's former high school coach and teacher described him as having `superior athletic abilities, and as being a great and popular leader.' He further described Jimmy as `a joy and an inspiration to those who had the good fortune to work and play with or for him.' 
In 1932, Jimmy entered the University of Alabama, in Tuscaloosa, on an athletic scholarship. Throughout his three years of varsity competition, he started on both the football and basketball teams. On campus, as well as on the athletic field, Jimmy was well known, loved and respected. He was a member of the `A' Club, Alabama Quadrangle, Jason's Honorary Junior Society, Pi Gamma Alpha Fraternity, O.D.K., Cotillion Club, and the Court of Appeals of the Student Government. Notably, Jimmy was captain of the victorious Rose Bowl and national championship football team of 1935, as well as captain of the 1934 Crimson Tide Basketball team. He was an All-Conference, All-Southeastern, and All-American basketball player while remaining active on campus and successful in the classroom. Jimmy ultimately received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1935. 
Jimmy continued in athletics, coaching basketball at Virginia Military Institute. As in high school, Jimmy led a small school to great heights. His teams were outstanding, consistently ranking higher than the much larger southern schools. At the time, newspapers called his accomplishment `a coaching masterpiece.' 
Despite his considerable professional and personal success and his growing notoriety, Jimmy asked for a leave of absence from coaching to join the United States Navy at the start of World War II. When he became a First Lieutenant in the Navy, he told his family that he had finally `made the team.' After a period of distinguished wartime service, on December 22, 1943, this Alabama sports-hero-turned-Naval-officer sadly died in South America, from wounds received while in the performance of his official duties. 
Jimmy died serving his country. He was a true leader, not only on the athletic field but in all areas of life. As a coach, a student, and a military officer, he was a fine role model for those around him. His dedicated, patriotic spirit will be remembered for a long time. He truly gave his all for victory. 
Today, 45 years after his untimely passing, my thoughts are with Jimmy's family and friends. His spirit will forever live on in those who knew him. Perhaps Jimmy's sister, Neta Walker Laycock, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, captured his outstanding personality best when she said: `If you knew him, you loved him. If you didn't, you missed a treat.'

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by Mr. Sessions and commend his effort to bring attention to the important, though obscure issue of tritium production. Since the looming threat of nuclear war dissipated in the aftermath of the demise of the Soviet Union, our strategic forces have been pushed to the sidelines. But recent events in the Asia subcontinent remind us not only of the danger from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction but also of the imperative to maintain the deterrent effect of our strategic weapons stockpile. 
Tritium is a radioactive isotope that is used in every nuclear warhead in our nation's stockpile. Like all radioactive matter, tritium decays over time. To compensate for the loss from decay, it is necessary to periodically replenish the level of tritium in each weapon. Despite this constant demand, tritium has not been produced for strategic purposes since 1988. Replenishment in the weapons stockpile has continued, however, by recycling tritium from nuclear weapons as they are dismantled. This is only an interim measure, and it is clear that the U.S. will have to resume tritium production sometime soon. 
In 1995, the Department of Energy decided to follow a dual-track approach whereby the two most promising options for tritium production would be explored. The first option is to purchase the radioactive gas from a commercial nuclear reactor. The second alternative is to design, construct, and test an accelerator system, which is called the Accelerator Production of Tritium or APT. The Department of Energy was directed by last year's National Defense Authorization Act to conduct an interagency review of tritium production policy issues. The Authorization Act also directed the Energy Department to determine which of two tracks will serve as the primary source of tritium production by the end of this year. 
There are forces in Congress, however, who are determined to derail this process. Proponents of APT are trying to prohibit the production of tritium at a commercial reactor. This misguided attempt would leave the Department of Energy with no choice other than using APT as the source for tritium production. Make no mistake about it, this is a thinly disguised attempt to mandate one particular technology that benefits one particular state. It is unfortunate that some are willing to put parochial interests in front of the national security imperative to develop a cheap, safe source of tritium. 
As the Secretary of Energy stated, the selection of tritium production should be based on `a careful and deliberate review of the cost, technical, schedule, and policy issues associated with each option.' These sentiments are supported by the Administration and the Department of Defense. I suspect that all of us who believe in fair and honest competition would agree that Congress should not interfere with the Department of Energy's process for selecting a tritium production source. If 
proponents of the APT are successful in their efforts however, Congress will do just that, and the decision will be based not on the merits of either option but solely on politics. 
The Congress and the taxpayer should be aware of the staggering differences in the price tag associated with each competing technology. The Congressional Budget Office estimate that APT will cost from $6.72 billion to construct. In addition to the initial construction cost, the APT option will require an annual appropriation of $150 million to operate. Furthermore, these estimates are based on preliminary conceptual designs, and the taxpayer of course will be asked to pay for any likely cost overruns. 
On the other hand, Mr. President, the commercial reactor option would only cost $1.8 to $2 billion. Moreover, this initial investment is similar to a loan, so every tax dollar spent will be returned to the Treasury. This has been certified by several independent reviews. I would like to add that this option does not require any additional appropriated funds because the commercial reactor owner, not the Treasury, will pay any cost overruns. 
If selected by the Department of Energy, a commercial reactor could begin producing tritium by 2003. This is two years ahead of the scheduled that the Departments of Energy and Defense have laid out as necessary to maintain the nuclear stockpile at the START I level. It uses a proven design which is currently being demonstrated. The commercial reactor also provides the Department of Energy with the flexibility to change tritium production quantities in response to changing need without major cost implications. 
Serious concerns have been raised about the technical feasibility of the accelerator option. While proponents of APT tout its supposed benefits, I would like to point out that the APT does not exist. It is still a paper concept. Also, several components that are critical to the development of this accelerator are still in the prototype stage. Even if the APT is developed on schedule, it would not be operational until 2007, which is two years after the Department's target date. As a result, the ATP option will require that the Department of Energy will have to find an interim source of tritium until the APT is proven. Any unforeseen delays in the development of the accelerator technology will extend the Department's reliance on an interim source. 
Mr. President, the issue before us can be boiled down to this: Should Congress dictate the tritium production method as a political favor regardless of technological risk and cost? I strongly believe that the commercial reactor option should not be removed from consideration by legislation fiat. Instead, the Senate has a responsibility to preserve the integrity of a process that rewards merits and competition. I urge my colleagues to support the Session's amendment and preserve the Department of Energy's dual-track options for tritium production.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I introduce a bipartisan bill with my colleagues, Senators John Rockefeller and Carol Moseley-Braun. Entitled the `Manufactured Housing Improvement Act,' (MHIA) this bill is designed to modernize the requirements under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 and to establish a balanced consensus process for the development, revision, and interpretation of Federal construction and safety standards for manufactured homes. 
Many do not realize that the manufactured homes of today are completely different from those of twenty or even ten years ago. They also do not realize that this is the fastest growing segment of the housing industry, and that it accounts for one out of every three new single family homes sold. Between 1980 and 1990, the industry experienced a 60 percent growth in market share, and last year set a twenty year sales record. There are good consumer-oriented reasons for this tremendous growth--manufactured housing offers quality and aesthetically pleasing housing at an average cost of $37,300, excluding the land. Today, manufactured housing has lowered the threshold to the American Dream of home ownership for millions of Americans, including first-time home buyers, senior citizens, young families, and single parents. 
At a time when home ownership is becoming harder for the average American to attain, and with more than 5.3 million Americans paying more than 50 percent of their incomes on rent, I believe it is imperative to update the laws that regulate the private sector solution to affordable housing. In order for the manufactured housing industry to remain competitive, Congress must modernize the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. 
My bill would do just that. MHIA would establish a consensus committee that would submit recommendations to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for developing, amending and revising both the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards. This provision will allow the manufactured housing industry to update and create applicable building codes and standards just like other participants in the housing industry. In addition, the committee would be authorized to interpret the standards, thereby eliminating confusion and uncertainty in the market place. 
The Manufactured Housing Improvement Act would authorize the Secretary of HUD to use industry labeling fees for the administration of the consensus committee and the hiring of additional HUD staff. The Secretary of HUD would also be authorized to use industry label fees to promote the availability and affordability of manufactured housing. 
This legislation is a very significant step forward in that both the Manufactured Housing Institute and the Manufactured Housing Association for Regulatory Reform endorse this legislation. The industry participants have modernized the quality and technology of manufactured housing. Congress must now modernize the laws that regulate an industry that provides affordable housing and contributes more than $23 billion annually to our nation's economy.

Mr. SHELBY. I rise in support of the Iran Missile Sanctions Act, H.R. 2709. 
Mr. President, I would like to make three important points regarding this legislation. 
First, the Administration's efforts to get Russia to stop assisting Iran's ballistic missile program have been an abysmal failure. 
Second, there is a broader failure of United States proliferation policy--a failure of monumental and potentially deadly proportions. 
Finally, the Senate must now take a greater role in addressing the proliferation crisis. Passage of the Iran Missile Sanctions Act is a first step. 
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, many in the United States have been greatly concerned that Russian entities were providing assistance to other state's ballistic missile programs. As evidence mounted, the Clinton Administration responded with diplomatic efforts from the working level up through the high level Commission chaired by Vice President Gore. Diplomatic efforts were supplemented with economic incentives. 
When additional reports of new and ongoing assistance emerged, including transfers to Iran in probable violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime, Congress waited for the Administration to impose the sanctions required. When sanctions were not imposed, some in Congress sought additional legislation to `encourage' the Administration to impose sanctions. 
The Administration again urged the Congress to wait--to give the diplomatic process more time, to give the Russians time to get an enforcement mechanism in place. Administration officials have repeatedly assured us that they have the problem under control. 
They are wrong. 
The Congressional Research Service summarizes the situation aptly when it reports that: 
Despite official denials from Moscow through 1997, evidence is growing of a pattern of missile technology transfers to Iran by Russian enterprises, institutes, and individuals, with direct and indirect Russian Government involvement, in violation of Russian commitments under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). Russian assistance could significantly accelerate Iran's indigenous missile program . . . 
There is ample intelligence information that supports this assessment, and I believe it is important for Senators to have the opportunity to review this information. Therefore, Senator Kerrey and I directed the Select Committee on Intelligence staff to prepare a compendium of the classified intelligence reporting on this subject and it is available for Senators to review in S-407. 
My second point is that the Administration's failure to stop Russia from providing assistance to Iran's missile program is only part of the broader failure of the Administration's non-proliferation policy. 
There is an ongoing pattern of assistance by Russia, China, and North Korea to rogue states and to other states such as India and Pakistan. There is also a pattern of weak Clinton Administration response to this proliferation. There is a connection. The Indians cited the weak Clinton Administration response to China's proliferation of missiles and nuclear assistance to Pakistan as one of the reasons they decided to test nuclear weapons. 
Some states seek weapons of mass destruction for prestige or in an attempt to enhance their global role. Countries like India and Pakistan justify their efforts by citing regional security concerns. 
Others like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea seek these weapons to threaten and intimidate their neighbors, in particular U.S. friends and allies, to threaten forward-deployed U.S. forces, and ultimately to threaten the United States itself. 
Such states do not wish to confront U.S. conventional military forces--the best in the world--with conventional weapons alone. They prefer to threaten our forces, or our cities, with asymmetric weapons of mass destruction to deter us from carrying out policies to protect our global interests. 
If states believe they can change the calculation of risks and benefits, they have a strong strategic incentive to acquire these missiles. Our near-total vulnerability to the ballistic missile threat only furthers their incentives. 
Without stronger disincentives, other states will continue to seek the financial, political, and strategic advantages that may be gained through proliferation, and through taking advantage of our patience and vulnerabilities. 
They have repeatedly offered carrots without wielding or credibily threatening the stick. 
Indeed, in many disturbing ways, the Administration's policies toward Russia and China may have enabled or even encouraged proliferation. By failing to respond to dangerous proliferation acdtivities to the maximum extent possible under domestic and international law, they have led others to question the will and ability of the United States to take strong measures to punish proliferators. 
Unfortunately, the Executive Branch has not yet come to this realization. 
It appears to be difficult to get this Administration to act with resolve, either by adding backbone to its proliferation policies or by responding to existing and future threats by developing additional means of deterrence and defense. It is difficult to persuade them to make diplomacy and arms control agreements tools of policy rather than policy objectives in-and-of themselves. 
However, the Congress can not simply stand back and point our fingers at the White House. We must do all that we can do to demonstrate that America has the will and the ability to respond. 
We must provide adequate funding to the Intelligence Community and to our military forces to detect and deter, and to prevail when deterrence fails. We must put in place the legislative mechanisms to enforce a robust counter-proliferation policy. We must continue to force the Administration to disclose dangerous proliferation activities. And we must make sanctions mandatory. 
Challenging, deterring, and defending against proliferation won't be easy or cost free. But it is the right thing to do. 
Mr. President, American lives are at stake. 
The Senate must act. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the bill before us.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to commend to my colleagues the nomination of Joan A. Dempsey, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security, and most recently the Director of Central Intelligence's Chief of Staff. Ms. Dempsey is the first nominee for the newly created position of Deputy Director of Central Intelligence for Community Management. 
Although Ms. Dempsey was nominated by the President just before the Senate adjourned last November, the Vice Chairman and I have waited to consider the nomination until outstanding issues regarding other positions created by the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 were resolved. 
We have reached an accommodation with the Director of Central Intelligence on these other positions, and we expect the President to put forward a nominee for the position of Assistant Director of Central Intelligence (ADCI) for Administration, soon. We have also agreed to allow the DCI to fill the positions of ADCI for Collection and ADCI for Analysis and Production without exercising the Senate's right for advice and consent, for up to one year, while we assess the new management structure. 
Ms. Dempsey appeared before the Committee in an open hearing on May 21, 1998. It is apparent that Ms. Dempsey is a well qualified career intelligence professional. The Committee is confident that she is entirely capable of doing a fine job as the Deputy DCI for Community Management. 
The Intelligence Community is facing a time of revolutionary change that is driven by the explosion of information technology. These rapid changes in technology must be assessed, evaluated and quickly integrated into all phases of the intelligence cycle. The Community must also have the flexibility to quickly focus on new and sometimes non-traditional targets. This requirement for flexibility was most recently underscored by the failure to anticipate the nuclear tests conducted by India. These events caught the Intelligence Community by surprise despite plenty of strategic warning that Indian leaders planned to revise their nation's nuclear policy. I do not agree with those who say that `we weren't surprised' by the tests because, in hindsight, they logically followed from what was being said publicly. 
This was a huge intelligence failure. As Zbigniew Brzezinski said in a recent editorial: `India's nuclear weapons tests . . . signal a truly consequential intelligence scandal.' He went on to say: `. . . it is the task of the intelligence community to detect, in a timely fashion, major foreign initiatives or programs that bear either on American security or affect American foreign policy interests.' More pointed than my own recent criticisms, Mr. Brzezinski concluded that `the failure . . . in the case of India suggests significant and truly disturbing incompetence both on the level of collection and analysis within the intelligence community.' Mr. president, we can debate the nature of the failure, but it was a failure nonetheless. 
Did the Community fail because of the way collection priorities were assessed and assigned? Was there too much reliance on certain types of intelligence collection and information? Is the `Intelligence Community' acting cohesively as a community, or is it resisting truly effective integration because of concerns over bureaucratic turf? Who brokers potential disputes over such turf and who has the authority to arbitrate agreements that are honored? These are all very important questions and the Intelligence Committee is seeking answers. 
In my view, the issues facing the Intelligence Community today are not solely a function of the level of resources that are available, even though this is a significant part of the problem. The Intelligence Community is still in many ways reacting to a changing world and not yet anticipating it. The Intelligence Community often displays the symptoms of an entrenched and calcified bureaucracy. This, Mr. President, must change. 
In the final analysis, our Intelligence agencies are accountable to the American people for two basic things: (1) to alert them to external threats; and (2) to spend their tax dollars efficiently and effectively. A great deal of the responsibility for these matters will rest on this nominee's shoulders. The Committee believes that she possesses the knowledge and leadership qualities that this new position will demand. We look to Ms. Dempsey to assist the DCI in ensuring that the Intelligence Community attains these goals and lives up to the highest standards of accountability as they work toward them. 
Mr. President, the Committee has reported the nomination of Joan A. Dempsey to be Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and we recommend that the nomination be confirmed. I urge my colleagues to support the recommendation of the Committee and vote in favor of Ms. Dempsey's nomination. I yield the floor.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Bond's amendment to establish a full-time IRS Board of Governors. I firmly believe that oversight of an agency with the equivalent of 100,000 full-time employees, a requested fiscal year 1999 budget of almost $8.2 billion, and a history of wasting $4 billion in an attempt to modernize the tax collection system, is, without question, a full time job. 
Furthermore, rigorous oversight will be critical to ensuring that the reforms that Congress has in store for the agency will be carried out effectively and expeditiously. I think the prudent strategy is to keep the agency on very short leash given the shocking stories that have come to light from the recent Finance Committee hearings. I have my own ideas as to how to liberate the taxpayer from the IRS--namely the implementation of my flat-tax proposal. But short of comprehensive tax simplification, I strongly support Senator Bond's efforts. 
Mr. President, the IRS is a very troubled agency that demands the highest level of scrutiny. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I feel we owe it to the American taxpayer.

<DOCNO>105-shelby-al-2-19980506</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, just for a few minutes I will also talk about the IRS reform legislation and a suggestion that I have that I think would improve it. I am at this point in time well aware that the pending business is another amendment, so I will only speak on this subject if I can. 
I think perhaps the most important power given to Congress in the Constitution is bestowed to Congress in article I, section 8, the power to tax. This authority is vested in Congress, as the President and Senate know, because as elected representatives, Congress remains accountable to the public, and when they determine tax policy, this should be more so. 
Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service effectively has the power to raise taxes through the use of its interpretive authority. Therefore, what I want to talk to the Senate and my colleagues about this afternoon for a few minutes is an amendment, which I am not offering now but I will in a future time, which will build upon past legislative initiatives that afforded protections to taxpayers from attempts by the Internal Revenue Service to bypass Congress and raise taxes through the regulatory decrees. 
In 1996, Congress passed the Congressional Review Act, which provides that when a major agency rule takes effect, Congress has 60 days to review it. During this time period, Congress has the option to pass what we call a disapproval resolution. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act would expand the definition of a `major rule' to include any IRS regulation which increases Federal revenue. 
For example, if the Office of Management and Budget finds that the implementation and the enforcement of a rule has resulted in an increase of Federal revenues over current practices for revenues anticipated from the rule on the date of the enactment of the statute under which the rule is promulgated, the rule will be found to be major in scope. Therefore, the amendment, or the legislation that I would like to see us adopt, sooner rather than later, would be to allow Congress to review the regulation and to prevent back-door tax increases on hard-working Americans. 
An excellent example of this occurred last year when the Internal Revenue Service attempted to increase taxes through the regulatory process. In this instance, the IRS disqualified a taxpayer from being considered a limited partner if they `participated in the partnership's business for more than 500 hours during the taxable year.' The effect of this redefinition would have been to make these individuals subject to a 2.9 percent Medicare tax. President Clinton had included the identical provision in his universal health care legislation in 1994. When the administration's plan failed, the IRS attempted to subject limited partnerships to the same tax increase by using its regulatory powers. 
I believe the intent of the Founding Fathers was to put the power to lay and collect taxes in the hands of the elected Members of Congress and no one else--not in the hands of the bureaucrats who are shielded from public accountability, but in the hands of Congress, who is accountable to the American people. 
The proposed Stealth Tax Prevention Act that I want to see become law would be particularly helpful in lowering the tax burden on small business, which suffers disproportionately from IRS regulations. I believe Americans are paying a higher share of their income to the Federal Government currently than at any time since the end of World War II. Allowing bureaucrats to increase taxes even further at their own discretion through the regulatory process, through interpretation of the Tax Code, I believe is intolerable. 
I believe this legislation is right and should be passed, and it is clearly in the spirit of the IRS reform legislation. This type of legislation would help rein in the power of the Internal Revenue Service and would leave the tax policy where it belongs, 
to elected Members of Congress, not unelected and not unaccountable IRS bureaucrats. I strongly urge my colleagues to get with me, to join me in the future in an effort to join the National Federation of Independent Business, NFIB, and the National Taxpayers Union, as well as a lot of my colleagues who would be supporting this type of legislation. 
The bottom line is that the stealth tax legislation that I have been talking about would improve accountability and it would put it where it belongs--in the hands of Congress and not bureaucrats. I think it is something we have to consider and I believe we will consider in the future. I have talked to the chairman of the Finance Committee about this, as well as other members of the Finance Committee, and they seem to be very interested in this. I am going to try to work with them in the future. 
I yield to the chairman.

I just think it is very, very important for the American people that we, as Members of the U.S. Senate and House, should be the people who lay taxes, or reduce taxes, according to the Constitution. But that is not what is happening. The Internal Revenue Service is doing it through the back door. We should do things through the front door because that is the American way, and I think it is accountable. I have worked with the distinguished Senator from Nebraska on this for several years and got some of this going at his suggestion.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will wrap it up on this point at this time. I am certainly not going to wrap up this issue. I think this issue is just now becoming ventilated here and shared with my colleagues here in the Senate. A lot of us have known this for a long time. But the IRS reform bill that Senator Roth and Senator Kerrey have been pushing here is about, among other things, the agency overstepping its authority and, in a lot of instances, there are horror stories of abusing taxpayers. But I can't think of a worse way to abuse taxpayers than when the IRS raises taxes through the back door, by the regulatory process, and then we think, how did they do this or why did they do this? Why did we give them the authority to do this? Yet, ultimately, Mr. President, we are accountable to the voters, as we should be. 
I think this is relevant. I am not going to offer it now in deference to the chairman and the Senator from Nebraska. But I want to make it clear that this is just the beginning of this fight because this makes a lot of sense to the American people.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Managers' amendment to the Resolution of Ratification, and of the Resolution of Ratification itself. 
Even though the Berlin Wall has crumbled and the Soviet Union has dissolved, NATO remains vital. It is the cornerstone of stability for a continent that is under massive transition. The nations of central and eastern Europe have established democratic forms of government and have deregulated their economies. The accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic is the best way to bolster their fledgling democracies and market economies thereby making their newly-won freedom irreversible. 
Let there be no mistake: our engagement with Europe since NATO was formed in 1949 has not been without its costs and not without its risks. Our engagement with the new democracies of Central Europe will not be without costs and risks either. The expansion of NATO will most likely antagonize Russia. 
More importantly, as a military alliance, we risk obligating the United States military to defend the citizens of distant and unfamiliar lands. In the end, though, we have found it difficult to stay out of these conflicts. Just about anywhere in the world where there is conflict, our military is there. 
I believe that disengagement from Europe, as history has repeatedly shown, would have far-reaching consequences. Therefore, I believe that we have no choice but to go forward with our current commitment to an expanded NATO. The Senate should vote to approve the Resolution of Ratification. 
But, like many senators, I remain concerned at the potential financial costs of expansion. As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I am concerned that the Administration has not yet come to terms with the price of supporting NATO expansion or more generally with the costs of America's position as the sole superpower. 
As was the case with Bosnia, there is reason to believe that the Administration is underestimating the costs of expansion in order to make ratification more palatable in the Senate. 
Without pouring additional funds into the defense budget, NATO expansion costs that are unaccounted for may hinder the Defense Department's ability to carry out missions in other vital areas of the world and at the same time to modernize the force. 
We have heard a number of cost estimates in the course of this debate. We must keep in mind that the new member nations, as the primary beneficiaries of expansion, must devote the resources necessary to shoulder their fair share of the common burden. 
And I know that nothing would undermine the support of this body for NATO, or that of the American people, faster than a perception that the new members, or existing members, for that matter, were not living up to their responsibilities in this regard. 
I am also concerned about another aspect of NATO expansion--one that has received less attention than the broader strategic issues, but one that is critical to the long-term success of an expanded alliance--namely intelligence and counterintelligence matters. 
Here too, after a careful review, I have concluded that the long-term national interests of the United States are best served by a vote in favor of the Resolution. But I would like to encourage Senators to take the time to review the report that I will describe shortly, which is available in classified form in S-407. 
An unclassified summary can be found in the Foreign Relations Committee report, Executive Report 105-14, on the Resolution of Ratification. 
This report was prepared by the Intelligence Committee staff at the direction of Senator Kerrey, the Committee Vice Chairman, and myself, and submitted to the Committee on Foreign Relations and to the Senate at large. 
It contains the staff's assessment of the intelligence implications of NATO expansion. 
The report is the culmination of the committee's work over the past year monitoring the progress of the accession process set in motion by the Alliance's decision last July to formally invite Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to join NATO. 
The staff has routinely reviewed the state of the accession negotiations, a process that concluded in December 1997 with the signing of the accession protocols. Committee members and staff have met numerous times with NATO negotiators as well as representatives from the acceding states, both in European capitals and in Washington, D.C. 
In preparation for the Senate vote on advice and consent, committee staff held numerous briefings with U.S. and NATO intelligence officials; reviewed documents prepared by the Intelligence Community; and posed numerous questions for the record. 
The committee directed the Executive branch--the Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Defense, National Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Department of State--to submit a formal report on the intelligence implications of enlargement. 
Committee staff also met with members of the Alliance's Interagency Working Group on NATO Enlargement (IWGNE) to discuss integration efforts in the intelligence field. 
Finally, committee members and staff traveled to national capitals of the three aspiring members to gain a more detailed, first-hand knowledge of how the civilian and military services of these countries operate, and whether adequate procedures are in place for the sharing of sensitive information with current NATO members. 
Once again, I would remind my colleagues that the classified committee staff report is available in S-407 for Senators who may wish to read it. 
The Committee has also prepared an unclassified summary of the report's major findings, and I would like to share with my colleagues the highlights.  
OVERVIEW 
The United States, along with its NATO allies, believes that membership in NATO cannot be granted piecemeal. 
NATO has thus determined that there will not be a two-tiered security structure within the Alliance. If and when the three accede to full NATO membership, they will share in all rights and obligations, and will be entitled to share in Alliance secrets. 
The work undertaken bilaterally and through NATO is geared to ensuring that the three invitees take the necessary steps over the transition or pre-accession period to demonstrate that they can and will guard NATO secrets appropriately once they join in April 1999. 
In assessing the reliability of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in guarding NATO secrets, the following factors are critical: 
1. the strength of democratic reforms, with a focus on ministerial and legislative oversight of intelligence services and activities; 
2. the degree to which the three countries have succeeded in reforming their civilian and military intelligence services, including the ability of the services to hire and retain qualified Western-oriented officers, and the evolution of political and public support for these services; 
3. Russian intelligence objectives directed against these countries, including any disinformation campaigns designed to derail, retard, or taint their integration with the West; 
4. counterintelligence and other security activities being pursued by the three countries, and the adequacy of resources devoted to these efforts; and 
5. the work underway between the three invitees and NATO to ensure that security standards will be met by the time the three join the Alliance.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Stevens, Senator Bond, Senator Domenici and their staffs for their efforts on behalf of the citizens of Alabama. Over the last several months, Alabama has suffered greatly as a result of multiple natural disasters. As the state was addressing the flooding in its Southern regions, a series of violent tornados devastated portions of Northern Alabama. These terrible events resulted in loss of life and extensive property and infrastructure damage. In many cases, whole communities were destroyed. While communities have banded together to begin the process of rebuilding their lives, the need for assistance is obvious to anyone who has viewed the destruction firsthand. 
I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Missouri as the Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA/HUD and Independent Agencies to increase the funding provided by the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. Although there has been extensive promotion of buyouts and relocation, it is my understanding that only 3 million dollars is available to the State of Alabama through hazard mitigation funding for this purpose. These funds are dramatically insufficient to meet the current needs and demands of the communities hit by these disasters. It is my understanding that the State of Alabama will be eligible for the CDBG funds included in this bill to respond to the flood and tornado disasters. Is it the Chairman's understanding that this funding could be used by the State for buyouts?

Is it correct that States eligible for this funding would be able to obtain waivers from the low to moderate income requirement in order to make use of this funding for the purposes of responding to their disaster needs?

I look forward to continuing to work with you to address the needs of those trying to rebuild.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Joint Resolution 42, the resolution of disapproval. 
Much has already been said on this issue, and I will make my comments brief. 
The United States Government has been working with the Government of Mexico for over a decade on fighting the flow of drugs. 
Year after year, we have received promises, commitments, and declarations to reduce the flow of narcotics from Mexico. But we have not seen the concrete actions that are required to block the flow of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana into the United States. 
For example, in 1997, Mexico agreed to facilitate the extradition of narcotics traffickers. In fact, no Mexican national has been extradited and surrendered to the United States as a result of that agreement. 
In a recent hearing, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence heard from witnesses from the Justice Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Drug Enforcement Administration on the status of Mexican antidrug efforts. 
While I cannot go into detail, their testimony was not at all optimistic and was, in fact, extremely disturbing to me. 
Of greatest concern is the endemic corruption that runs rampant at all levels throughout those Mexican institutions tasked with combating narcotics trafficking. 
The story on the front page of today's New York Times, describing corruption in the ranks of the Mexican military is, if accurate, especially disturbing, since the military is considered less corrupt than the Federal police force. 
While Mexican officials often speak of efforts to prevent this corruption, no definitive steps have been taken to target the illicit drug monies that make this corruption possible. New laws are discussed, debated, in some cases even enacted, but they are not implemented. 
And while there have been a few highly publicized prosecutions of corrupt officials, many more are allowed to retire or are simply reassigned. 
I wonder whether criminal prosecution is selective and whether such determinations are themselves reflections of such corruption. 
Again, actions speak louder than words. 
I understand that the Clinton administration and other regional governments are discussing the concept of a regional approach to drug cooperation certification, to replace the current process. 
I have serious doubts about replacing the current system with regional certification, since the almost certain result would be that Mexico and others would be given a pass rather than being held accountable for their actions. Simply stated, it would make certification a meaningless process of averaging an array of mediocre and poor performances. 
Furthermore, before considering Mexico as a member of such a regional group, we should consider Mexico's participation in current regional counternarcotics efforts. It is hardly encouraging. 
For example, the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force located in Key West, FL, is one such organization. It includes representatives from all of the United States armed services, as well as law enforcement agencies, and an equal contribution from our British and Dutch allies. 
I urge my colleagues to visit the Task Force and hear their frustrations regarding Mexico. Again, while Mexico says it is using every asset to prevent the transshipment of drugs into the United States, the officials there will tell you this is just not so. 
They cite example after example of the detection and tracking of drug-carrying ships and planes. 
But when it comes to handing off these targets to the Mexican authorities, there is either no response or such a limited and late response, the traffickers often escape and disappear into Mexico. 
When we make informal suggestions that Mexico send its representatives to the multi-national task force to correct this problem, the response is that they are willing to discuss it. But, they have been discussing it for several years now. 
Mr. President, for these reasons I strongly support the resolution to decertify Mexico. It is time to judge Mexico on its actions rather than empty promises.

<TEXT>
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the passage of S. 1668, the Disclosure to Congress Act of 1998. 
This legislation directs the President to inform employees of the intelligence community that they may disclose information, including classified information, to an appropriate oversight committee of Congress when that information is evidence of misconduct, fraud, or gross mismanagement. 
The committee is hopeful that this legislation will also encourage employees within the intelligence community to bring such information to an appropriate committee of Congress rather than unlawfully disclosing such information to the media, as happens from time to time. 
It is imperative that individuals with sensitive or classified information about misconduct within the executive branch have a `safe harbor' for disclosure where they know the information will be properly safeguarded and thoroughly investigated. 
Further, employees within the intelligence community must know that they may seek shelter in that `safe harbor' without fear of retribution. 
It is not generally known that the Whistle Blower Protection Act does not cover employees of the agencies within the intelligence community. 
The whistle blower statute also expressly proscribes the disclosure of information that is specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs. 
In other words, classified information is not covered by the current whistle blower statute. 
Therefore, employees within the intelligence community are not protected from adverse personnel actions if they choose to disclose such information to Congress. 
In fact, an employee who discloses classified information to Congress without prior approval is specifically subject to sanctions which may include reprimand, termination of a security clearance, suspension without pay, or removal. 
Last year, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reported the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 which included section 306, a provision with language similar to the bill before you. 
Section 306, however, was much broader than the language in this bill because it directed the President to inform all executive branch employees that it would not be contrary to law, regulation, executive order, or public policy to disclose certain information, including classified information, to an appropriate committee or their own Member of Congress. 
The Senate passed that bill by a vote of 98 to 1. 
Shortly after the Senate vote, the administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy claiming that section 306 was unconstitutional and that if it remained in the bill, in its present form, senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill. 
Last year, in conference, members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence also expressed concern over the constitutional implications of section 306. 
Our House colleagues were also mindful of the administration's veto threat as expressed in the Statement of Administration Policy. 
In response to their concerns, the Senate offered an amendment that significantly narrowed the scope of the provision to cover only employees of agencies within the intelligence community, as does this bill. 
The amendment offered in conference further narrowed the provision by allowing disclosure only to committees with primary jurisdiction over the agency involved. 
In deference to our colleagues' concerns, however, our committee agreed to amend the provision to express a sense of the Congress that the Congress and executive branch have equal standing to receive this type of information. 
In conference, members of both committees committed to hold hearings in the second session of the 105th Congress with the intent to fully examine the constitutional implications to such legislation and to pursue appropriate legislative remedy. 
Our committee fulfilled our obligation by holding hearings on February 4 and 11. 
The committee heard from constitutional scholars and legal experts on both sides of the issue. 
An administration representative argued that section 306 and any similar language represents an unconstitutional infringement on the President's authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. 
The administration asserted the following:  
The President as Commander in Chief, Chief Executive, and sole organ of the Nation in its external relations has ultimate and unimpeded authority over the collection, retention, and dissemination of intelligence and other national security information. 
Therefore, any congressional enactment that may be interpreted to divest the President of his ultimate control over national security information is an unconstitutional usurpation of the exclusive authority of the Executive. 
Finally, the Administration argues that the Senate's language vests lower-ranking personnel in the Executive Branch with a `right' to furnish such information to a Member of Congress without prior official authorization from the President or his designee. Section 306 and any similar provision is, therefore, unconstitutional. 
The committee also heard from constitutional scholars that argued that the President's authority in this area is not exclusive. 
Hence, Congress also has the authority to regulate the collection, retention, and dissemination of national security information.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise because I have some grave concerns with the current form of the Government Secrecy Act of 1997 (S. 712) and I am pleased that the distinguished Majority Leader and my distinguished colleagues are open to a discussion of this legislation with the goal of establishing the basic principles on which Federal classification and declassification programs are to be based. More stability, reliability, and consistency are needed in the government's approach to both the protection--and I emphasize protection--as well as the release of classified information to the public. The recent compromise of sensitive information through rushed declassification highlights the need for more oversight and accountability of the declassification process. I have serious concerns that S. 712 does not adequately protect sensitive intelligence sources and methods and will unnecessarily cost the taxpayers many hundreds of millions of dollars. 
I support the Commission on Government Secrecy's finding that the public has a right of access to the large majority of government-held information and that, in general, too much information is classified and kept secret too long. However, secrecy is essential to intelligence, and U.S. security has depended and still depends on secrecy to succeed. We must proceed with caution in our commitment to make more classified information available to the public. In this regard, I am concerned that some provisions of S. 712 erode the Director of Central Intelligence's statutory authority and ability to protect intelligence sources and methods. 
Further, the bill will cost untold millions to declassify and release the tremendous amount of currently classified material in a way that still protects the most sensitive sources and methods. For example, DOD reports to have over 1.2 billion pages of 25 year and older material of historical value that requires review for declassification. The current estimated average cost of review is $1 a page. This means that the cost of declassification of this group of documents alone will be over $1.2 billion--that's billion with a `B', Mr. President. 
I am also concerned that the so-called Declassification Center created in S. 712 will not correct the problems facing the current declassification system. It will end up being another costly and unnecessary government bureaucracy. Instead, to promote greater accountability, I propose that we create a more effective and enhanced Executive branch oversight function for classification and declassification programs. In addition, I believe sanctions for unauthorized disclosures should be added to the bill. We need to consider new and unique categories of secrecy for our most sensitive intelligence operations--perhaps to include very serious penalties for public discussion of these activities. 
Finally, I am troubled that the bill leaves open the possibility of judicial review of Executive branch classification decisions. This will undoubtedly lead to costly legal challenges that could result in judicial second-guessing of the Commander-in-Chief on national security matters. 
I look forward to addressing these and other concerns in our Committee. Our collective goal should be to craft legislation that establishes a sensible framework for a classification and declassification system that continues to protect sources and methods while improving oversight and accountability at an affordable cost. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, 
I rise today to introduce the Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis Act. This legislation would establish a small, professional office within the legislative branch charged with analyzing the potential impacts of Federal rules and regulations. 
In April 1996, Congress passed and the President signed the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. Included in this legislation was a provision known as the Congressional Review Act or CRA which established an expedited process for Congress to review and disapprove Federal agency regulations. Under the CRA, agencies are required to send their final regulations to Congress 60 days before they take effect, and they can be overturned by a joint resolution of disapproval that is signed by the President. At the time of enactment, this law was hailed as a way to rein in agencies and prevent the implementation of costly regulations with few practical benefits. 
The legislation that I am introducing would give Congress the tools to fully implement the CRA and reduce the regulatory drain on our economy. Under current law, the potential impacts of new regulations are not systematically evaluated--a fact that I think would come as a surprise to most of our constituents. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within OMB reviews regulations only to ensure that they conform to Administration policies and current law and that they do not interfere with the actions of other Federal agencies. However, this office has performed these minimal calculations on only a small fraction of the new rules promulgated in recent years. In addition, the General Accounting Office (GAO) was given some additional responsibilities under the CRA. GAO must now submit to Congress a checklist citing which reports an agency has or has not completed when developing a new rule. These reports are often incomplete or nonexistent, and Congress has little recourse for obtaining factual information in these instances. 
For these reasons, I believe that a Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis (CORA) is essential to allowing Congress to fulfill its oversight obligations. At present, Congress does not have any resources for objectively evaluating the potential costs and benefits of new regulations. CORA can provide those resources. While the executive branch has thousands of employees devoted solely to creating and enforcing regulations, Congress has few means of effectively overseeing those rules. Our committee staffs are already stretched to their limits, and they cannot possibly study and evaluate each and every regulation that comes out. We need a professional staff that is charged with analyzing regulations and providing Congress with its findings. By gaining access to this valuable information, Congress will then be able to decide whether or not to pursue further action under the CRA. 
Specifically, CORA would analyze both the monetary and non-monetary effects of all new major regulations. Non-major rules would be evaluated at the request of committees or individual Members of Congress. In addition to providing information on costs and benefits, which are very important, CORA's analyses would also explore possible alternative approaches to achieving the same goals as the proposed regulation at a lower cost. Finally, this office would issue an annual report on the total cost of Federal regulations to the United States economy. 
I believe that anything which costs the average American family $6,800 per year warrants very careful Congressional examination. Without the objective information that CORA can provide, oversight cannot properly be carried out. 
Senator Bond, the chairman of the Small Business Committee, has joined me as a cosponsor of this legislation. I urge the rest of my colleagues to join us in establishing this office in order to ensure that future regulations do not place unnecessary burdens on the American public.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 took important steps to begin to combat the financial problems that have plagued the Medicare system for some time. However, the BBA included a provision that may disqualify Medicare beneficiaries who receive home health care stemming from their need for venipuncture services. Many Alabamians who rely on the Medicare home health care program have contacted me expressing their concern with this provision. Much of the concern has resulted from a lack of information as to the true effects of this provision. 
Therefore, I rise today to offer the Medicare Venipuncture Assessment Act of 1998. This legislation will provide an eighteen month moratorium on the venipuncture provision included in last year's BBA, and direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct a study to determine what the specific effects will be of doing away with venipuncture as a qualifying skill for home health care. 
In addition, this legislation provides a window of time for Congress to address any problems found by HHS, and craft an appropriate solution that protects the seniors who receive home health care, without perpetuating fraud and abuse in the system. But perhaps the most important aspect of the Medicare Venipuncture Assessment Act is that it will provide much needed piece of mind to many of our seniors. Mr. President, we owe it to our constituents to separate fact from fiction with regard to this matter, and fully inform them of the effects of the venipuncture provision contained in last year's BBA. 
If administered correctly, home health care can be a cost effective alternative to nursing home and hospital based care. This legislation protects the Medicare home health care system by providing specific statutory action to root out fraud and abuse in the program, while ensuring that the seniors who truly need home care receive it. I strongly encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort by cosponsoring the Medicare Venipuncture Assessment Act of 1998.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed House Joint Resolutions 91 and 92 granting the consent of Congress to the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa [ACT] and the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint [ACF] River Basin Compacts. I would like to thank the majority leader, his staff, and my colleagues from Alabama, Georgia, and Florida for their efforts and leadership in moving these valuable bills. 
With the passage of these compacts, the three States now may move forward and begin the difficult task of allocating water resources throughout the region. The compacts set forth the framework for the three States to resolve the critical issue of how our scarce water resources are divided. This partnership will enable the States to determine the best utilization of our shared water supply. These rivers are an invaluable resource to our States--essential to Alabama's economic and personal well-being. 
I look forward to continuing to work with Gov. Fob James and the Alabama delegation to assure that Alabama's water needs are met today and in the future.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee on today's successful passage of the Amtrak reauthorization bill. I acknowledge that the procurement, labor, and liability reforms contained in this bill as amended by the chairman's substitute amendment are the end result of difficult negotiations and compromises among many competing interests, and represent many years' effort. Issues such as contracting out and mandatory 6-year severance pay have been taken out of statute and put on the negotiating table. 
I hope this bill's provisions, along with future negotiations, result in some real reforms. Even with the $2.3 billion in tax credits that will be released on January 1, 1998 if this reauthorization bill is enacted into law, Amtrak will still be hard-pressed to continue running trains in the future, if meaningful improvements are not made in the way the railroad does business. Since I have taken on the chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations Transportation Subcommittee this year, one thing has become crystal clear: Amtrak does not intend to be weaned from Federal subsidies any time soon. The Amtrak-Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees [BMWE] union agreement reached last weekend contains contingencies that require appropriations levels higher than those in current law or contemplated by the balanced budget agreement. Amtrak touts its glidepath to self-sufficiency as the funding path that will eventually lead to the elimination of Federal operating subsidies. However, the Amtrak-BMWE agreement points to a glidepath in the opposite direction. 
The fiscal year 1998 transportation appropriations bill provided $793 million for Amtrak operating and capital expenses. Added to Federal subsidies paid to Amtrak since the Corporation was formed in 1971, the taxpayers have thus far spent $22 billion on a national railroad that carries fewer than 20 million passengers a year--less than 1 percent of all annual intercity passenger trips in the United States. According to the General Accounting Office, the average Amtrak direct Federal subsidy is $38 per passenger trip, compared to $1.50 per commercial airline passenger enplanement. This is subsidy that comes out of the pockets of every American taxpayer, and yet, wide swaths of the country are not served at all by Amtrak, and many communities that do have train service only see the train a few times a week, or at odd hours of the night. 
There is a growing sense that Federal funding of Amtrak can no longer be justified on fiscal or mobility grounds, and that it is time to consider phasing out the railroads's public monopoly status. I really hope that the reforms contained in this reauthorization bill do make a difference in the way Amtrak does business. Because if they do not, by releasing these tax credit funds, the Congress may simply be extending Amtrak's financial instability for 2 more years, and costing the taxpayers yet more appropriated funds for the subsidy of a failed experiment.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan bill with my colleague from Florida, Senator Connie Mack, and 11 other original cosponsors from the Banking Committee. Entitled the `Financial Regulatory Relief and Economic Efficiency Act of 1997,' the bill is designed to promote greater access to capital and credit for businesses and consumers, while ensuring the safety and soundness of our financial system. 
The acronym for the bill, FRREE, is actually indicative of the bill itself. If enacted, the bill would free valuable resources at financial institutions now being used to comply with the bureaucratic maze of current rules and regulations, and instead allow institutions to commit more of those resources to the business of lending. This is especially important, now that we are entering the 80th month of the current economic expansion. The 9 completed expansions since the end of World War II have averaged 50 months. Thus, many professional economists, businessmen, and academics worry how much longer the expansion of the current business cycle can go. Because this bill frees up resources that are inefficiently being used in the private sector, I believe this bill could have a substantial positive impact on extending the current business cycle as well as minimize any future economic downturn. 
One key provision would repeal an antiquated law that disallows banks to pay interest on business checking accounts. Due to sophisticated and expensive technology, big corporations can get around this problem by employing sweep accounts. However, smaller, family owned businesses cannot take advantage of this expensive technology and are forced to keep their money in noninterest bearing checking accounts. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, concluded in their 1996 Joint Report, `Streamlining of Regulatory Requirements,' that the statutory prohibition against paying interest on demand deposits no longer serves a public purpose. Today, the repeal also has the support of the Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
The bill also allows the Federal Reserve to pay interest on reserve balances, thus reducing potential volatility in short-term lending rates. Given the historical importance of price stability, it is imperative we give the Federal Reserve this tool in order to better conduct monetary policy. 
In short, Mr. President, the bill repeals outdated laws that hinder the management practices of institutions; cuts bureaucratic red tape; eliminates unnecessary bookkeeping; increases funds available for residential mortgage lending; and eliminates unnecessary restrictions on the discounting, and bundling of financial services to consumers. 
The bill enjoys the overwhelming support of the Senate Banking Committee and the chairman of the committee, Chairman D'Amato, is committed to having hearings on this bill when we return early next year.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in my capacity as chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence to support passage of the conference report on S. 858, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998. This important legislation authorizes funds for intelligence programs and related activities of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and other Government entities. 
This conference report also represents the culmination of a lengthy and detailed review by the Intelligence Committee of the plans, policies, and programs contained in the President's budget submission for fiscal year 1998. In this regard, I wish to commend the vice chairman of the committee, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, for his assistance in crafting this important legislation. Senator Kerrey played a pivotal role in shaping this legislation, and I am pleased we were able to work together, in a bipartisan manner, to bring this legislation to the floor. It's a good bill; my colleagues should support it; and the President should sign it into law. 
Let me also take this opportunity to commend Chairman Goss, my counterpart on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, along with Mr. Dicks, the ranking minority member. We have developed what I consider to be a very positive and productive working relationship, which manifested itself in the smooth functioning and cordial atmosphere in which our conference deliberations took place. 
Although Senate and House conferees completed action on this legislation 7 weeks ago, a joint decision was made not to file the conference report at that time. This was due to the fact that the conference committee on the Fiscal 1998 National Defense Authorization Act had yet to resolve all open issues. Given that funding for all intelligence programs and activities is, consistent with past practice, included in the intelligence authorization bill, we agreed to withhold bringing our bill to a vote until conference action on the Defense authorization bill was completed and the Defense authorization bill was voted on by the Senate. 
The conferees on S. 858 took several important steps to improve this country's ability to collect, analyze, and produce intelligence about America's adversaries. We authorized funds above the President's request because we believe there are areas where additional resources are needed in this post-cold-war period of uncertainty. While the mission of our intelligence gathering organizations has not changed, the areas on which they must focus have become diverse and more challenging. 
I am, therefore, particularly pleased that the conferees agreed with the Senate that additional resources should be added for advanced research and technology development and in five areas that I call the `five C's': counternarcotics, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, counterintelligence, and covert action. 
The conferees did not agree, however, to include Senate section 306, `Encouragement of Disclosure of Certain Information to Congress,' in the final conference report. The 20 conferees from the Senate--the 19 members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Senator Strom Thurmond, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee--voted unanimously in favor of the provision that would require the President to notify Federal employees and contractors with classified contracts that they are not violating any law, Executive order, regulation, or policy if they disclose information, including classified information, evidencing wrongdoing to the committees of Congress with primary oversight of the Federal department or agency involved. A majority of the House conferees voted against the measure, but they agreed that the issue should be explored in more detail and they committed to producing legislation soon. Both committees will schedule hearings on the subject early next year. The conferees did include a declaration, in lieu of section 306, expressing the sense of Congress that Members of Congress have equal standing with the executive branch to receive classified information to carry out their constitutionally mandated oversight functions. 
I am disappointed that we were unable to convince a majority of our House colleagues to support Senate section 306. Given the importance of congressional oversight of intelligence activities, the committee will devote significant attention to this important issue in the near future and I look forward to producing legislation that both Houses can agree on. I also hope that the President will work with the committees in drafting such legislation. 
I urge the President to reconsider his threat to veto a provision that would allow individuals within his own administration to come forward to the appropriate committees of Congress with evidence of wrongdoing, rather than leaking it to the press, as seems to be the case today. 
Again, Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.

Mr. SHELBY. I am familiar with it. This project is being developed at the National Aviation and Transportation Center on Long Island and is anticipated to provide an intermodal transportation simulation training, education and planning asset for the entire nation. A total of $19.5 million in federal funding over the next five years has been determined by officials at the National Aviation and Transportation Center as needed to help carry out this project. According to these same officials, this level of federal funding is expected to trigger at least $5 million in private sector contributions and up to $7.5 million in funding from New York State.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, according to the latest statistics, Alabama is home to 47,011 military retirees. We have the eight largest population of retired service personnel in the Nation. Senator Bond highlighted the many changes in DOD's health care system that are limiting access to health care for military retirees aged 65 and above. I would like to briefly explain how these general trends are affecting the 47,011 military retirees in my State. 
The 1995 BRAC slated Fort McClellan for closure by 1999. When that base closes, Noble Army Hospital will be forced to close as well. The emergency room at Lyster Army Hospital at Fort Rucker is being closed. At all of the military treatment facilities, space-available is becoming unavailable. In addition to these physical changes, TRICARE came on line in region 4, and Alabama now is experiencing excessive delays in receiving reimbursement payments and other well-known problems associated with TRICARE. Many private physicians who provided CAMPUS are leaving the DOD health care, which I believe is unacceptable and irresponsible. 
Despite extended service and sacrifice, retired service members are the only Federal employees who will lose their government-sponsored health insurance when they become eligible for Medicare. This bill takes a modest step forward to insuring that military retirees receive at least as much as Members of Congress or retired Federal employees. Military retirees have dedicated their lives to protecting our Nation; we owe it to them to pave the way for health care equity. 
I thank Senator Bond for his leadership in introducing this legislation. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bipartisan bill.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Joseph Barry Mason, the Dean of the College of Commerce at my alma mater, The University of Alabama, in my hometown of Tuscaloosa. Dean Mason is a remarkable man, a distinguished educator and a good friend. 
Joseph Barry Mason received his undergraduate degree from the Louisiana Tech University College of Administration and Business. Upon receiving his Ph.D. in marketing from The University of Alabama in 1967, Dr. Mason joined the faculty of The University and, since that time, he has served that institution with distinction. During his tenure, Dr. Mason has served as the Chairman of the College of Commerce Department of Management and Marketing, and since 1988, as the Dean of the College of Commerce and the Russell Professor of Business Administration. 
Dr. Mason's professional associations extend beyond the campus of The University. He is a former chairman of the board of the American Marketing Association and the 1976 Beta Gamma Sigma National Scholar. 
Further, in 1984 Dr. Mason served as the Chairman of the UA Task Force on Cost Savings. In that capacity, Dr. Mason worked with the General Motors Rochester Products Plant and the United Auto Workers in Tuscaloosa in order to identify cost savings and prevent the closure of the 200-employee facility. As a result of his successful efforts, the groundwork for future academic-industrial partnerships was laid. 
For his excellence in education, Dr. Mason has received numerous distinguished awards. Dr. Mason received the Leavey Award for Excellence in Private Enterprise Education from the Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge, PA. In 1986, he was named the first annual recipient of the Academy of Marketing Science Outstanding Educator of the Year Award. And in 1994, Dean Mason was designated a Distinguished Fellow of the Academy of Marketing Science. 
At various points in his career, The University has honored Dean Mason, as well. For bringing distinctive credit to the academic community, Dean Mason was awarded the John F. Burnman Distinguished Faculty Award and The University of Alabama National Alumni Association Outstanding Commitment to Teaching Award. 
Recently, Dean Mason was honored by Louisiana Tech University as its 1997 Distinguished Alumnus. As many of my colleagues know, on Saturday, November 1, 1997, The University of Alabama will play Louisiana Tech at our Homecoming Football game. 
On that day, Dean Mason, loved and respected by all who have known him, will be honored as a friend and leader to not only The University of Alabama, but also to Louisiana Tech. On this day, on behalf of my wife, Annette, we wish Joseph Barry Mason our sincerest thanks and congratulations for his dedication to making a difference.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this weekend, Chinese President Jiang Zemin arrives in the United States for the first state visit by a Chinese official since 1985. As you know, China has been described by many experts as the No. 1 foreign policy challenge that the United States will face in the 21st century. Next week's summit will help set our course as we respond to that challenge. 
I have traveled to China six times since I first visited in 1983. Most recently, I traveled to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong during the August recess where I met with numerous senior Chinese leaders, including the Chinese Foreign Minister. 
In my many visits and contacts, I have witnessed the enormous, and overall positive, changes that have taken place in China since the death of Mao. Yet, while China today is clearly not the China of the cultural revolution, neither is it a `former Communist country,' as President Clinton has suggested. 
As chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I am especially interested in Chinese foreign and military policies and Chinese intelligence activities, particularly those that pose potential threats to vital American interests. Last month, I convened in the Intelligence Committee exhaustive hearings into Chinese threats to United States national security, including the reported Chinese plan to influence United States elections. 
I am well aware that there is no country that poses such risks, such opportunities, and such dilemmas for United States foreign and security policy. It is clear that China today, as an emerging economic and military power in the post-cold war, has the option, and increasingly the will, to challenge vital United States interests around the globe. 
It is equally clear that despite the demise of communism virtually everywhere around the globe, and despite China's extensive and impressive economic liberalization, the Chinese regime remains determined to maintain its repressive domestic political system. 
I will shortly address these issues in greater detail, but, first, I would like to make just a few general points. 
When President Clinton meets with President Jiang, he will have the opportunity to define the United States-China relationship in a way that defends vital United States interests and promotes the values upon which our country was founded, while recognizing at the same time legitimate Chinese interests and aspirations. 
But President Clinton, I believe, must make it clear that if China wishes to be accepted as a responsible world power, it must act as a responsible world power. If China wishes to work together to promote peace and stability in the region and the world at large, as President Jiang suggested in a press interview last weekend, it must not undermine peace and stability in Asia and around the world by reckless and aggressive actions. And President Jiang, I believe, is wrong when he invokes, for example, Einstein and the theory of relativity to justify China's refusal to comply with norms and ideals which, while not yet universal, are on the march worldwide. 
Relativity, as most of you know, is an immutable law of physics. Relativism is something altogether different, and it is not a concept to which we as Americans subscribe. 
President Clinton, I believe, must respectfully make it clear that the President of China is wrong when he says that `democracy and human rights are relative concepts and not absolute and general.' 
Our Founding Fathers did not speak in relative terms when they wrote: 
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. 
The courageous demonstrators in Tiananmen Square echoed these ideals when they tried to peacefully exercise their right of consent. They adopted our Statue of Liberty as their symbol, and we saw it brutally destroyed by Chinese tanks on TV. 
In one final general point, we sometimes hear the refrain from the Chinese that they do not wish to be bound by sets of rules and norms that they had no say in creating. 
There are certain truths that are not limited by time and geography, and the `inalienable Rights' spoken of by the Founding Fathers, I believe, are among them. 
Proliferation and security issues are very important. With the end of the cold war, and the end of the Soviet massive military threat that had provided the glue for the United States-China relationship since its beginning, China has increasingly been willing to challenge core United States interests, by the destabilizing proliferation of weapons technology, and by direct and indirect threats against United States friends and allies. 
In June of this year, the CIA's nonproliferation center reported that China was `the most significant supplier of [weapons of mass destruction]-related goods and technology to foreign countries' in the second half of 1996. 
China's sales of antiship cruise missiles, ballistic missile technology, chemical weapons, materials and nuclear technology to Iran, a hostile country whose military forces threaten United States interests in an area of vital national concern, directly endanger the lives of American soldiers, sailors and airmen, and, as we know, threaten our ability to defend our interests in the region. 
Further, these same weapons serve to intimidate our friends and our allies in the Persian Gulf region. The last time the United States was compelled to defend its interest in the region in Operation Desert Storm, we were able to create a coalition of friendly states, many of which were willing to accept the deployment of United States forces on their soil. Who can say, though, in the future that our allies would respond in the same way in a future conflict if they were faced by a credible threat of Iranian missiles bearing nuclear, chemical or biological warheads? 
The threat from Chinese technology sales is not limited, Mr. President, to weapons of mass destruction. Accurate, conventionally armed missiles, especially antiship cruise missiles like the C-802's that China has sold to Iran, pose a serious danger to United States forces. Remember the U.S.S. Stark. Bear in mind that the single greatest American loss of life in the Persian Gulf war occurred when an Iraqi Scud missile with a conventional payload struck a barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. 
It is difficult to speak of `working together to promote peace and stability' when, for example, China has reportedly supplied Iran with hundreds of missile guidance systems, and in the second half of 1996 contributed `a tremendous variety of assistance' to Iran's missile program, according to the CIA. 
The transfer of nuclear and missile technology to Pakistan, despite repeated United States objections, jeopardizes the stability of South Asia and flies in the face of United States nonproliferation goals, even though it is less of a direct threat to United States forces. But by increasing the likelihood of a nuclear war that could kill millions of innocent people, China jeopardizes its claim to be seen as a responsible world power. 
It is in this context that we consider the administration's reported plans to announce the implementation of the 1985 United States-China Agreement for Nuclear Cooperation. This agreement cannot, by law, be implemented until the President certifies to Congress that China has met a number of conditions, notably, one, that effective measures are in place to ensure that any United States assistance is used for the intended peaceful activities; and, two, China has provided additional information on its nuclear nonproliferation policies, and that based on this and all other information, including intelligence information, China is not in violation of paragraph 2 of section 129 of the Atomic Energy Act which, among other things, bars United States nuclear assistance to any country that has assisted any other country to acquire nuclear capabilities and has failed to take sufficient steps to terminate such assistance. 
According to press reports, Mr. President, China has made or is willing to make a number of commitments in order to obtain this certification. United States diplomats are now in Beijing trying to nail down an agreement on these issues. And at this stage, after years of hair splitting and denying with respect to similar commitments in the past--hair splitting and denial, I might add, on the part of both Governments--these commitments must be, I believe, unambiguous and in writing if they are to convince the United States Congress. 
Just last week, China joined the Zangger Committee, which imposes some modest controls on nuclear exports. The administration also reportedly believes that China has complied with its May 1996 commitment not to provide assistance to any unsafe- guarded nuclear facility. 
In addition, China has reportedly agreed to cease selling antiship cruise missiles to Iran. While agreement on nuclear cooperation is not conditioned on such transfers of advanced conventional weapons, it would certainly be difficult for the administration to argue for nuclear cooperation while China was continuing to sell advanced munitions that could be targeted on U.S. naval vessels protecting freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf. 
As a result of these actions, and other actions, administration officials believe they can make the statutorily required certification, if not at the summit, then in the foreseeable future. If and when such a certification is made, the Congress will have the opportunity to review and, if necessary, overturn this certification. 
As chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I am asking the Director of Central Intelligence to provide the Intelligence Committee with the information upon which the administration would base its determination. The committee will also closely scrutinize this intelligence to ensure that it does support the administration's determination, whatever it is. 
But, Mr. President, without prejudging my decision, should the matter come before the Senate, I have the following concerns about early implementation of a nuclear agreement. It seems likely today, Mr. President, and for the immediate future that China lacks the military forces to seriously challenge the U.S. military power in the region. 
However, Mr. President, as the only great power whose defense spending has increased in recent years, China is acquiring advanced missile, naval, air, amphibious, and other forces capable of projecting power in East Asia and the Pacific region. 
In addition, Mr. President, the Chinese military apparently has learned the lessons of the American victory in the Persian Gulf war, which demonstrated the superiority of modern technology. 
Second, in its commitments to date, China has, in effect, agreed only to control sales to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities. This commitment sounds useful on its face, but it is potentially meaningless in countries like Iran and Pakistan that are reportedly pursuing a clandestine military program, because equipment, materiel, and know-how from safeguarded facilities can be transferred to other unsafeguarded facilities, as we all know. 
Third, Mr. President, the Congress will want to closely scrutinize the text of any commitments by the Chinese Government. 
In particular, I believe we must ascertain whether these recent promises are limited to halting any future cooperation or trade in strategic technology or, Mr. President, whether they also apply to ending existing contracts and transactions that have been ongoing. 
If they are only to apply to future activities, then I would be concerned that a whole host of ongoing and dangerous cooperative ventures between China and Iran and other countries would in effect be `grandfathered' and thus not prohibited. 
Fourth, China must recognize that mere grudging compliance with the letter of its international agreements does not make China a responsible member of the world community. I believe, Mr. President, that China must go beyond a narrow reading of its obligations to demonstrate by actions as well as words that it accepts, as it has not done in the past, that the spread of dangerous and destabilizing military technologies is not in anyone's interest, including China's. 
China, I believe, should, therefore, cease its cooperation with all Iranian nuclear, missile, and other military programs, even if a particular transaction may be permissible under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Missile Technology Control Regime, or other international legal agreements. 
I would like to know, Mr. President, how the Chinese foreign and military policy in Asia will work in the future. 
In the wake of the cold war, China, which for years viewed the U.S. presence in East Asia and the Western Pacific as a stabilizing force, now resents a security structure that is increasingly viewed as intended--to quote some of them--to `contain' China. Most troublesome, China has shown a willingness to pursue its goals in the region by the threat or use of force. 
Mr. President, as we were reminded in last year's Taiwan Straits crisis, Beijing has never renounced the use of force to reunify Taiwan with the mainland. 
President Clinton, I believe, will have an opportunity to have a serious discussion with the Chinese President about how bracketing Taiwan with missiles, followed by a thinly veiled threat against the United States, comports with his stated goals of `maintaining peace and stability in the region and the world at large.' 
Our President also must make clear, I believe, our determination that the Taiwan issue be resolved peacefully so that China will never be tempted to resolve it by force. 
In addition, Mr. President, to tension over Taiwan, China has used and threatened force to enforce its other claims in the South China Sea. This undermines a lot of allies and friends. 
It seems likely that today and for the immediate future, Mr. President, China lacks the military forces to seriously challenge U.S. military power in the region. However, as the only great power whose defense spending has increased in recent years, China is certainly acquiring advanced missile, naval, air, amphibious and other forces capable of projecting power, as I reminded my colleagues just a few minutes ago. 
Mr. President, to speak of human rights in the area there, in 1996, in a damning and exhaustive report on Chinese human rights practices, the State Department concluded that `almost all public dissent against the central authorities was silenced by intimidation, exile, or imposition of prison terms or administrative detention.' 
In addition to its suppression of political dissent, China continues to maintain a cruel and massive network of forced labor camps. They continue also an inhumane one-child policy, including forced abortion, repression of religious groups, use of forced labor, and ongoing repression in Tibet. 
President Clinton, I believe, must place President Jiang on notice that Americans are offended by the notion that human rights are `relative' and that their practices fit within an acceptable definition of human dignity. 
I believe, Mr. President, we must ask ourselves, how much real progress can we make in our relationship with China as long as the regime feels compelled to stamp out every ounce of political dissent and believes that it cannot survive without the `laogai' labor camp system? 
Mr. President, on a somewhat more positive note, economic developments, both within China and between China and the United States, continue to generally move in the right direction. However, we encourage China to continue to take the painful but necessary steps to qualify China for membership in the World Trade Organization, notably in the area of opening China's markets. The sooner they do, I believe, the better off they will be. 
We are also encouraged to see some meaningful progress on the protection of intellectual property rights. 
Americans support China in its search for prosperity for its people. But we do not, Mr. President, support, and will not tolerate, attempts to build prosperity by ignoring the rules of international trade. Nor will Americans support prosperity built, even in part, on the backs of forced laborers or prosperity that is the result of a Faustian pact in which the Chinese people are forced to effectively surrender their political and human rights in return for economic growth. 
Mr. President, let me sum up and be clear on where I stand. I support, as most of us do, a strong United States-China relationship, and I have always done so. President Clinton can work with President Jiang to raise Sino-United States relations to a new high level, as the Chinese President has requested. 
But to truly protect American interests and reflect American values, this relationship cannot be based on ceremony alone. We cannot gloss over problems or sweep them under the rug or keep them unfulfilled--and unenforced--as promises. 
I believe, Mr. President, it must be based on responsible international behavior with respect to nonproliferation and on refraining from the threat or use of force. Our relationship must be based on steady and consistent progress toward political as well as economic freedom in China. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce legislation to honor John McKinley. John McKinley was a statesman, an influential State legislator, one of the founding trustees of the University of Alabama, U.S. Senator, and the first U.S. Supreme Court Justice from the State of Alabama. 
Born on May 1, 1780, in Culpepper County, VA, John McKinley began his career in Kentucky after learning the law on his own. In 1818, he moved to Alabama and shortly after his arrival, McKinley, along with Andrew Jackson and John Coffee, became a member of the Cypress Land Co. This company was the largest single purchaser of land in north Alabama in the land boom of 1818. In addition to pursuing his fortune, John McKinley almost immediately entered Alabama politics. In 1820, he was elected to the State legislature. 
In 1826, McKinley was elected by the State legislature to the U.S. Senate where he served until 1831. In the Old Senate Chamber, just down the hall, he espoused a political theory that to many in Washington may seem quaint. He believed that the national government's sovereignty was limited solely to the powers granted by the Constitution unless expressly relinquished by the States. As chairman of the Committee on Public Lands, he promoted transferring Federal lands to the States for economic development. Defeated for a second term in the Senate, McKinley returned to the Alabama legislature. 
In the legislature, McKinley gained considerable influence by denouncing the national bank and endorsing President Jackson s efforts to dismantle it. He also supported Martin Van Buren, Jackson's candidate for President in 1836. When the Jacksonian Democrats regained control of the State legislature, the new majority re-elected McKinley to the Senate. Shortly thereafter, as a reward for his loyalty to Jackson and endorsement of Van Buren, the newly elected President nominated McKinley for a seat on the Supreme Court. The Senate confirmed his nomination 1 week later on September 25, 1837, by voice vote. 
Justice John McKinley was assigned to the ninth circuit, which encompassed Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. While riding circuit in Mobile, AL, Justice McKinley heard the first of three cases collectively known as Bank of Augusta versus Earle. In this controversial decision, McKinley upheld an Alabama statute prohibiting out-of-State banks from making loans in Alabama. The case which was appealed to the Supreme Court was heard in 1839. 
The Court overturned the McKinley decision, and only McKinley dissented. Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote the majority opinion which declared that there was a law of comity that applied among the States. Therefore, a bank had as much a legal right to offer interstate loans as they do in the charter State. In the lone dissent, however, McKinley made the interesting point that the Court's majority had applied the State sovereignty doctrine in the extreme and that the States ceased to be nations when they ratified the Constitution. 
His most significant contribution to the Court was writing the majority opinion in Pollard's Lesse versus Hagan (1845). This opinion declared that the Federal Government held public lands in trust until a territory became a State. At the time a territory entered the Union, the public land was rightfully State property. This decision provided a legal basis for opening public lands and for furthering economic development. 
In addition to Pollard, Justice McKinley wrote nine other opinions in 1845, his most prolific year on the Court. After 1845, his work became sporadic due to general poor health. He attended, however, the Court's sessions as regularly as possible and contributed as best he could. John McKinley remained a member of the Court until his death in the spring of 1852. 
There is no Federal building to honor Justice McKinley, and the legislation that I am introducing will correct this oversight. The bill designates the Federal courthouse and U.S. Post Office complex in Florence, AL as the `Justice John McKinley Federal Building.' The legislation has received the endorsement of the following: Mayor Frost and the Florence City Council, the Lauderdale County Commission, Tennessee Valley Historical Society, Florence Historical Board, Heritage Preservation, Inc., the Alabama State Bar Association, the Lauderdale County Bar Association, and the McKinley Young Lawyers of the Shoals. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and pay tribute to this Alabama statesman.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the conference report on the fiscal year 1998 Department of Transportation and related agencies appropriations bill. This bill is very similar to the transportation appropriations bill that the Senate approved 98 to 1 on July 30. It provides the highest level of funding for Federal-aid highways in history--$22.9 billion. That's slightly less than the amount we had included in the Senate bill because, in conference, we agreed to fund some other House priorities, but it's still a record level. 
The actual distribution of those funds among the States will depend on reauthorization of ISTEA--the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991--which has provided authorization for Federal surface transportation programs for the past 6 years and which expired at the end of fiscal year 1997. But this increase of almost $3 billion over fiscal year 1997 will almost certainly mean more Federal highway spending for each State. 
The conference report also includes $300 million for the Appalachian Development Highway System as proposed by the Senate. This is a downpayment toward meeting the Federal Government's commitment to completing that System.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the bill also provides $1.7 billion for airport improvement grants, which is $700 million more than the administration requested. In total, this bill contains $30.1 billion for investment in infrastructure that the public uses, that is, highways, transit, airports, and railroads. That represents an 8-percent increase over the administration's request. 
This legislation will improve safety: It provides an 11-percent increase in funds to improve highway safety and will permit FAA to hire an additional 235 aviation safety inspectors and 500 air traffic controllers. 
Major changes in the bill as a result of conference deliberations include the addition of $150 million in transit operating assistance and reductions of less than 1 percent in the multi-billion dollar FAA and Coast Guard operating accounts. 
The Senate accommodated requests we received from Senators as fully as we could. In conference, of course, we had to accommodate requests from Members of both the Senate and House with no increase in funds over the Senate bill to cover these requests. That was a very difficult process. We tried to be fair and balanced in our treatment of Members' requests. 
I want to reiterate a point I made when I brought the Senate bill to the floor in July. Many Senators wanted funds for highway projects of special interest to them and their States. This year, ISTEA reauthorization is providing a vehicle for special project funding, especially in the House where there is very active consideration of such funding. I assure my colleagues that I believe that the Congress has at least as legitimate a role in designating funding for specific highway projects as it does in designating which transit projects will be funded. I intend to review the situation after enactment of ISTEA reauthorization legislation and to work with my Senate and House colleagues in the year ahead to ensure that we have an opportunity to designate funding for highway projects of special interest to our States and communities. 
There are a great number of people to thank for getting this bill completed. I want to single out a few for special thanks for all their efforts. 
First, the chairman, my good friend from Alaska. I know he wanted to move this bill along promptly, but he was patient and allowed me to work out the issues that were holding up conference and was always willing to lend his compelling voice to support the Senate position in our discussions with the House. 
The majority leader as well played a critical role in the negotiations with the House. I want to thank him for his leadership, advice, and guidance, as well as for his personal involvement on this bill. 
I want to thank my distinguished ranking member on the subcommittee, Senator Lautenberg, for his part in moving the process forward. We don't always take the same position on transportation issues or funding priorities, but he is always a strong advocate for meeting the transportation priorities of the Northeast and presents a perspective on this bill that comes from a great deal of hands-on experience with transportation issues. In addition, this bill has provided an opportunity for me to work closely with the distinguished ranking member of the full committee, Senator Byrd. One of the common priorities Senator Byrd and I share in the Transportation appropriations bill is the completion of the 
Appalachian Development Highway System. Through his leadership and support, we have been able to provide substantial support for meeting that priority. 
I also want to thank the other members of the subcommittee for their efforts and the efforts of their staffs in support of the Senate's position during the conference. This subcommittee works well together, and I am blessed with the luxury of having subcommittee members who take transportation issues very seriously and are quick to let me know of their positions on issues. In particular, I want to commend the senior Senator from Missouri, my good friend, Senator Kit Bond. Senator Bond has been a major force in transportation funding issues this year as he has the uncommon responsibilities of sitting on the Budget Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, and on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation. He was a primary advocate for higher highway funding during the budget process; he is a major force in the Senate consideration of reauthorization legislation, and is one of the most thoughtful and effective members of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. Senator Bond can be a dogged advocate for issues of interest to the Show Me State. He was in a position to put passage of the Transportation appropriations bill in jeopardy if his legitimate interest in a matter before the conference was not met. In a display of the statesmanship that shows me why he is such an effective Senator, he refused to hold the bill up--instead, he sought a creative way of meeting both the interests of his State and the needs of the Congress to move this legislation along. I pledge to him here that I will work with him to ensure the satisfactory resolution of this issue. 
In addition, I want to thank a few staff members who worked hard to put this bill together. The staff director of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Steve Cortese played a critical role in resolving issues between the House and the Senate so that we could have this conference report before the Senate today. His counterpart on the House side, Jim Dyer, as well, deserves note and a word of thanks for his efforts to that end. Although they work in different bodies, these two professionals work together well and are a credit to the appropriations process and the Congress. Further, the subcommittee staff, Joyce Rose, Reid Cavnar, Wally Burnett, and for a short time, George McDonald, as well as my legislative director Kathy Casey and Chief of Staff Tom Young, worked long and hard to put this bill together and I thank them. In addition, Jim English, Peter Rogoff, Peter Neffenger, Carole Geagley, and Mike Brennan have helped make this a truly bipartisan bill, and I thank them. 
I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish in this bill. It will benefit all Americans as it helps improve transportation services in this country so that the economy and personal mobility are better served. 
I now turn to my distinguished ranking member from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, who has worked with me in a bipartisan spirit to produce this bill. 
Mr. President, I believe overall that this is a good transportation appropriations bill. It is not perfect. Nothing is perfect. But Senator Lautenberg, my colleague from New Jersey, former chairman, now the ranking member of the committee, worked diligently together with our staffs to put this bill together. We had protracted discussions with the House, and at the end of the day we are here with a completed conference report, one which I believe that most people in this body can support. 
I want to take a minute and thank my staff director, Wally Burnett, for all the work that he has put into this night and day. He knows the subject. He has been very, very diligent and the bill reflects that diligence. 
I also want to thank my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, for the work and the knowledge that he has of these transportation issues. Knowledge that he is beginning to share with me as time goes on. And, to his staff director, Peter Rogoff, I thank you for cooperating with us on so many of the issues. And, at the end of the day, at the end of the week, and at the end of this conference we are here. 
At this point, I yield the floor.  
Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the chairman for including language on particulate matter research in the VA, HUD, and independent agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. This bill allocates approximately $50 million for research on the possible health effects of airborne particulate matter. The administration based its most far-reaching and costly air quality standards on inadequate research and methodology. The language in this bill ensures that critically needed research is carefully and objectively mapped-out. 
The emotionally charged debate on this issue, the concern expressed by State, local, and Federal officials over the rules, and the numerous unanswered questions and uncertainties identified by EPA's science advisers and other independent scientists only serves to underscore the pressing need for further research. There is widespread disagreement in the scientific community over the adequacy of the studies the EPA used as a basis for the new air quality standards. 
I am greatly disturbed that these costly standards were promulgated without any form of scientific consensus that the regulations will provide any measurable improvement in human health. Currently, these standards are subjective in nature not based on available objective scientific evidence. It is critical to our Nation that a well organized and thought out scientific review of these matters occurs. Premature implementation of the standards is far more damaging to our Nation than taking the time to allow a larger portion of the scientific community to study and review these standards. I believe my colleague from Alabama would like to share his thoughts on this matter.

Considering the current controversy surrounding the lack of scientific evidence for the air quality rule, I am pleased that your language opens future research to a diverse section of our Nation's scientists. Mr. Chairman, how does this language ensure that the EPA will establish a collaborative relationship with the participating organizations.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to the very important discussion that the Senate is having regarding campaign finance reform, and I commend the Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, for not only his leadership but for his tenacity in defending what he believes and so many of us believe is an assault on the first-amendment rights of all Americans. 
I also thank Senator Lott, our leader, for his leadership in scheduling this debate, and I commend my colleagues who thus far have added insight and value to our discussion. 
Mr. President, if we are to have campaign finance reform, I believe we must achieve those changes necessary to ensure public trust in our institutions and our Government officials. Serious reform must take into consideration the significant number of Americans who are compelled to make mandatory political contributions at their workplace as a condition of employment. No citizen should be required to make involuntary contributions to any candidate, party, or political interest group. No corporation, no labor union, and no business entity should have the power to twist the arms of their employees or members. These practices are wrong and un-American, and I believe they must be ended as part of our overall effort to reform the financing of Federal elections. 
Serious reform must also contain provisions that increase the frequency and specificity of mandated contribution disclosure. I support measures which bring about greater transparency, those that allow the American people to know the where, the when, how much, and from whom of campaign contributions. 
The last election cycle was filled with numerous activities that violated existing campaign laws. As we proceed through this debate, we should be mindful of the fact that these new reforms do nothing to reach those past violations. We must ensure that illegal foreign contributions are kept from election campaigns, and I believe that we must ensure disclosure violations are uncovered and are punished. Thus, perhaps the most important so-called change we can now achieve is to ensure that the existing laws are routinely and are properly enforced. 
However, in our zeal for change, we should not compromise the rights and freedoms of the same people we claim to protect. We must pay close attention, I believe, to the numerous Supreme Court decisions which clearly set forth that the regulation of many campaign-related activities directly implicates first-amendment rights. 
In 1974, the Supreme Court reviewed the Federal Election Campaign Act in the case of Buckley and struck down the statutory restrictions on campaign expenditures. In its holding, the Court concluded that political discourse `is at the core of our electoral process and of the first amendment freedoms.' 
While the Court did allow a minimal level of restriction that we know about--caps on the direct contributions to candidates--and only for the purpose of preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, it granted the full protection, Mr. President, of the first amendment to anyone spending money to communicate an idea, a belief, or a call to action. 
In no uncertain terms, the Buckley decision makes clear that the first amendment forbids the Federal Government from restricting political speech and expression rights by way of campaign expenditure limits. 
Mr. President, the Buckley decision does not stand in isolation. For the past 20 years, the Supreme Court of the United States has returned to this decision and consistently and unequivocally reaffirmed its soundness. The Court's subsequent decisions clearly demonstrate this, such as in FEC versus National Conservative Political Action Committee. The Court, tracking the Buckley decision, struck down restrictions on funds spent in support of publicly financed Presidential candidates in furtherance of their election. The Court held that such expenditures fell squarely, Mr. President, within the protections of the first amendment rights. 
Also, in the FEC versus Massachusetts Citizens for Life, the Court ruled that the voter guide published by an incorporated entity was entitled, Mr. President, to first amendment protections and invalidated an enforcement action the FEC brought against this organization. 
More recently, Mr. President, in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee versus FEC, the Court again, following Buckley, held that first amendment protection covers someone communicating an idea, a belief, or a call to action. The Court found that political party expenditures made in support of party ideals and even party candidates were protected under the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States so long as the expenditures were not made, as we say, in coordination with candidates. 
Mr. President, the Supreme Court rulings provide us two guideposts in our endeavor to reform campaign finance. We have the constitutionally proscribed power and thus the responsibility to prevent corruption and/or the appearance of corruption in Federal elections, but we can `make no law * * * [that] abridges the freedom of speech * * *,' quoting the Constitution. 
Therefore, I believe that it is essential that any reform initiatives we pass do not further encroach on the basic rights protected under the first amendment. It is not the proper role of Government, I believe, to restrict the ability of the American people to participate in election campaigns. It would be absurd, I think, to allow the Government to control the manner in which Americans communicate. If reform crosses these lines, I think it commands too high a price, it goes too far. 
Mr. President, in light of the Supreme Court holdings, I do not understand and cannot support the present legislative efforts that directly impinge on first amendment rights. I particularly object to the so-called reform in Senators McCain and Feingold's bill which restricts independent parties from communicating `for the purpose of influencing a Federal election,' regardless of whether the communication is expressed advocacy. 
Just think about it. Time and again, in case after case, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that Congress 
can only legislate to restrict campaign-related activities where those activities comprise the express advocacy of a particular candidate. The Court even specified in a footnote in the Buckley case what it meant by express advocacy--communications such as `vote for,' `elect,' `defeat' and `reject.' So when Congress places restrictions on communications that do not fall within this tightly drawn class, it violates, according to the Court, the first amendment. 
Mr. President, as we have consistently heard on the floor during this debate, the first amendment is not a loophole. It is beyond our constitutional authority to restrict the ability of independent groups to communicate their political views where they do not engage in express advocacy. 
Mr. President, I am also greatly troubled, as are others, by a provision in Senators McCain and Feingold's bill which prohibits independent communications that merely mention the name of a candidate within 60 days of a Federal election. Not only does such a restriction strike at the heart of first amendment protections, it all but guarantees a free ride to the incumbent involved in the election. 
Just think about it, Mr. President. If there is no commentary regarding a candidate's performance in office at the time when the electorate is most tuned into the campaign, no sitting Member would ever lose. Incumbents would be able to capitalize on the inherent advantages of being in office, while challengers would be forced to rely solely on their own and probably much less resources. 
This provision is incumbent reelection insurance, not campaign finance reform. Make no mistake about it. The electorate must be able to hear all the views about candidates in a timely manner. And candidates must be able to stomach the full range of opinions regarding their candidacy. 
Mr. President, we must clean up the system but without compromising fundamental first amendment rights. I believe this task is difficult but not impossible. Without infringing upon any American's rights, we can ensure that the American people control the direction of their contributions, have an understanding of who gave what to whom, and are confident that our elections are free of foreign influence, which is so important. 
Mr. President, the Senate, I believe, should work to enact these measures into law and not infringe on our first amendment rights. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, for yielding time to me this morning, because I think what we are talking about is very important to the American people. 
The hearings that the Senate Finance Committee held last week, regarding the problems that pervade the Internal Revenue Service, were very, very important in bringing to light, as the Presiding Officer knows, the level of abuse taxpayers often are subject to at the hands of the Internal Revenue Service. This sort of activity all across this country has affected people in every State, including my State of Alabama. Today I would like to just share for a few minutes one such instance with you and my colleagues in the Senate, and talk about why we need to do more than simply reform the Internal Revenue Service. 
One of my constituents in Alabama, Phillip Prebeck, of Foley, AL, provides an illustration of an average play-by-the-rules Alabamian, or we should say American, who has had to endure the IRS harassment. His story is particularly poignant because it involves his late daughter, Mary Hunt, and it occurred during a time when he was still grieving over her death. 
After Mary's death in November of this past year, 1996, Mr. Prebeck prepared his daughter's tax return, deceased daughter's tax return, in early March of this year. And, after including a copy of his daughter's death certificate and a letter explaining the situation as well as other appropriate information, Mr. Prebeck filed the return. 
In June, the IRS sent a letter to his daughter, his deceased daughter, indicating that she owed $937, and that she needed to pay up. Think of it in this context. Mr. Prebeck phoned the IRS and informed them again that his daughter, Mary, had passed away and had left no estate. The IRS representative, who would not give her name, informed him that he was responsible for the liability nonetheless. What followed was a series of mixed messages from a slew--really, a slew of IRS representatives, as to whether he was responsible for his deceased daughter's tax liability. 
Mr. Prebeck was unable to work through the situation with one IRS representative, because they refused to allow him to call them back. Think about it. This made it very frustrating, because he could not determine what exactly was expected of him, and he was trying to do what was right as a citizen. Eventually, Mr. Prebeck, with the help of my staff, determined that he did not have to pay the IRS, despite what he had been told over the phone by the IRS on several occasions. Nonetheless, Mr. Prebeck continued to receive correspondence from the IRS, which had first been mailed to his deceased daughter's address, warning him that the liability remained. 
He then requested a letter from the IRS, absolving him of responsibility, to provide him with some peace of mind as a parent--if you can imagine--and some tangible assurance that he would not continue to be harassed by the Internal Revenue Service. They agreed to provide such a letter, but to this day, and this morning, they have yet to do so. 
Mr. President, this type of situation that I have just related is not uncommon in America. It is probably not uncommon in the State of the Presiding Officer, Colorado. For every Phillip Prebeck there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of taxpayers, from Alabama, perhaps from your State of Colorado, perhaps from the State of Georgia--every State in the Union, who contact my office or your offices with similar stories. There are more who have had similar problems but do not call. 
I find the Internal Revenue Service's actions particularly appalling in light of the agency's inability to manage its own financial affairs. For example, and I know you have heard of this because the GAO did the report, in 1996 the General Accounting Office reported the following regarding the audit performed on the IRS. Again, I am going to repeat, this was an audit on the IRS by the General Accounting Office. The Senator from Georgia understands it and has read it. 
No. 1, this was in 1995, the amount of the total revenue was $1.4 trillion, and tax refunds to the people and companies was $122 billion. But it could not be reconciled to accounting records maintained for individuals in the aggregate. There was a discrepancy of $10.4 billion; $10.4 billion--where? In the IRS itself. The amounts reported for various types of taxes collected--that is Social Security, income tax, excise taxes, for example--cannot be substantiated by the Internal Revenue Service itself. The reliability, according to the General Accounting Office, of reported estimates of $113 billion for valid accounts receivable, and $46 billion for collectible accounts, cannot be determined as of this day. 
GAO found that the IRS could not document how, and I will use their words, a `significant portion' of their $3 billion nonpayroll operating budget was spent. In other words, the IRS, the Internal Revenue Service, could not document how they spent $3 billion of nonpayroll operating budget. Can you imagine that anywhere in America? 
The amounts that the Internal Revenue Service reported as appropriations available for expenditure of operations cannot be reconciled fully with the Treasury's central accounting records showing these amounts, and hundreds of millions of dollars in differences have been identified. 
Indeed, the General Accounting Office determined that because of poor IRS financial management, that it could not conduct a reliable audit of the Internal Revenue Service. Think about it. That is appalling. Mr. President, the Internal Revenue Service should have been forced to provide each American with a copy of this report to read it for themselves. The agency cannot account, again, for $10.4 billion in tax revenue and cannot tell you or the American people how they spent $3 billion. But, they can find time to hound a gentleman over his deceased daughter's $900 tax liability that he is not responsible for under the law. 
Thankfully, the Senate Finance Committee's hearings have galvanized support for reform of the Internal Revenue Service. But what I encourage my colleagues to keep in mind is that the complexity of the Tax Code has created the environment that has spawned the problems that pervade the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS's governance, financial management and quality control problems and the Internal Revenue Service's inability to serve the taxpayer are symptoms of a much larger problem. To address only these issues without embarking upon a comprehensive effort to replace the Tax Code, I believe, is to treat the symptoms and not the root cause of the problems. 
My concern, and it is a concern of a lot of my colleagues in the Senate, is that after possibly implementing the recommendations of the national commission to restructure the IRS, some may conclude that their job is complete, but that would be a fallacy. On the contrary, I view these proposals only as a beginning, and nothing more than a shortrun solution. Earlier this year, I introduced, again, the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act that proposes to abolish the Tax Code as we know it and replace it with a flat tax. 
While some reforms may offer some short-term solutions and relief to taxpayers, they cannot address the larger problems which continue to plague the Internal Revenue Service and the underlying system itself. I believe we must have broad-based reform of the code that provides the public with a simple formula to calculate their taxes without fear of an IRS audit. 
Although I believe that the flat tax is the best replacement of the current system, I am not here to trumpet its virtues this morning. I simply want to remind my colleagues today that we must not forsake ever our broader agenda to seek comprehensive tax reform. Piecemeal reforms are not a substitute in any way for broad-based reform and will not solve the problems that pervade the IRS. We owe it to the American people to reform the Internal Revenue Service as we know it. I yield the floor.  
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of The Honorable Albert Lee Smith, Jr., who died at age 65 on August 12, 1997, from injuries suffered in a tragic fall at his home. Mr. Smith was a friend, dedicated husband and father. He served with distinction in the U.S. House of Representatives during the 96th Congress on behalf of the people of Alabama's Sixth District. 
Albert Lee Smith, Jr., grew up in Birmingham, AL and received his bachelor's degree from Auburn University. Always a leader, he served as an officer in the U.S. Navy, and was later awarded an honorary doctor of law degree from Samford University. 
In 1956, Mr. Smith joined the Jefferson-Pilot Life Insurance Co. in Birmingham. For the next 41 years, Mr. Smith had a distinguished career as a Chartered Life Underwriter. He served as president of the Birmingham Association of Life Underwriters and held several leadership positions in other professional organizations. 
Albert Lee Smith, Jr. was a true gentleman and conservative visionary. He was an extraordinary leader for the Alabama Republican Party. Active since 1962, Mr. Smith served as a pollwatcher, precinct captain and vicechairman of the county party. At the time of his untimely passing, he was serving as a vice-chairman of the Alabama Republican Executive Committee. Further, Mr. Smith was a delegate to the 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1984 Republican National Conventions. 
Driven by his desire to help Alabamians, Albert Lee Smith, Jr., ran for Congress to work for lower taxes and a smaller, more efficient government for the American people. Among the first in Congress to do so, Congressman Smith demonstrated concern for the strength of American families as the sponsor of the Family Protection Act. As a member of the House Budget Committee and the Committee on Veteran's Affairs, he supported tax cuts and a strong national defense. 
Albert Lee Smith, Jr., knew the importance of restoring America's financial and spiritual health for our children and grandchildren. For his dedicated service, Congressman Smith was honored by several important awards: The Taxpayers Best Friend Award from the National Taxpayers' Union; the Leadership Award from the American Security Council; and the Golden Bulldog Award from the Watchdog of the Treasury, among others. 
Congressman Smith was a public servant of the first order. The Alabama Republican Party nominated him as its candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1984. Following his departure from the House of Representatives, President Ronald Reagan named him in 1985 to the Federal Council on Aging, an appointment subsequently confirmed by the U.S. Senate. 
An exemplary citizen, leader and role model, Congressman Smith served as a board member of the Birmingham Campus Crusade for Christ and was a member of the Kiwanis Club and the Metropolitan Board of the YMCA. Mr. Smith served as a deacon at the First Baptist Church in Birmingham and was elected by the Southern Baptist Convention to the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs. As a husband, father and friend, Albert Lee Smith, Jr., was a compassionate and thoughtful human being. 
My prayers go out to Albert's wife, Eunie Walldorf Smith, their children, Karen, Smith, Albert Smith, and Meg Wallace, and their family and friends. The Honorable Albert Lee Smith's lifelong dedication to community and country made our world a better place.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we are now resuming consideration of the fiscal year 1998 Transportation appropriations bill under a unanimous-consent agreement reached last evening. I believe this is important legislation that will have very significant effects on every State in this Union. It sets a record-high obligation ceiling on Federal highway spending. It provides the resources for the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Coast Guard to operate our Nation's airways and waterways safely and efficiently. 
Mr. President, it increases, again, our commitment to improving highway safety in this Nation. We want to finish our deliberations on this bill and pass it, if we can, and I ask now for the cooperation of all my colleagues in the Senate who have the option to offer amendments under the consent agreement and have not yet brought them to our attention. I would like for them to come to the floor with their amendments. 
Later, I intend to seek a unanimous-consent agreement that all amendments must be offered this evening, that we debate any amendments on which there is disagreement this evening, and that we have a final vote tomorrow. Accordingly, I encourage all Members desiring to speak on the bill on any of the amendments that they propose to come to the floor as soon as possible. 
Further, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments--we have a list of amendments and some of them we have worked out and will be stricken. If I could, I would like to go through the list of the ones that we worked on and we will not have to consider. First is the Hollings amendment on the list; the Graham transit amendment; the Durbin amendment; two amendments by Senator Enzi; the Mack amendment; one of the Abraham amendments; the Bond amendment--two of the Bond amendments. I believe that would take care of a number of them. Some of the other amendments still will be before us, we hope, in some form soon or will be disposed of in some way.

Mr. SHELBY. We have assumed current law with respect to transit programs, until such time as a reauthorization bill is enacted. With respect to formula and discretionary grants, the bill sets obligation limitations on contract authority for both programs and appropriates $190 million for formula grants. It is our understanding that the only significant amount of contract authority for transit programs that is expected to carry over into fiscal year 1998 is $392 million for transit new start projects. In the absence of a reauthorization bill, the only significant new funding for transit formula and discretionary grant programs next year would be the amount appropriated for formula grants in this bill and the amount remaining available for new start projects. The Federal Transit Administration would apportion the appropriated funds for formula grants according to current formulas, and the new start funding would be distributed based on statutory direction in this bill. Both those distributions would be revisited when reauthorization legislation has been enacted and, presumably, has created new contract authority for these programs.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased this evening to present the fiscal year 1998 Department of Transportation and related agencies appropriations bill. The subcommittee's allocation was $12.157 billion in nondefense discretionary budget authority, and $36.893 billion in nondefense discretionary outlays. 
The bill I am presenting today, along with my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, is within those allocations and is consistent with our determination to achieve a balanced budget. This bill will also contribute to a safer and more efficient transportation system in this country and therefore contribute to economic growth and a better quality of life for all Americans. 
This bill provides $30.1 billion for investment in infrastructure that the public uses, that is, highways, transit, airports, and railroads. That represents an 8 percent increase over the administration's request. 
The bill includes a Federal-aid highway obligation limitation of $21.8 billion for investment in our Nation's highways. This is a record high level. And $1.63 billion above the President's amended budget request. The actual distribution of that obligation authority among the States will depend on reauthorization of ISTEA, also known as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, which has provided authorization of our Federal surface transportation programs for the past 6 years and which, as the Presiding Officer knows, expires at the end of this fiscal year. 
This increase of almost $3 billion over the obligation limitation in place for this year will almost certainly mean more Federal highway spending for each of our States. I want to illustrate for Senators what this increase might mean for them even though I must caution my colleagues this evening that no one can predict now how highway funds will be distributed among the States next year.

Mr. SHELBY. If our limitation becomes law by the end of September, the States will be apportioned an average of 18 percent more--18 percent more--highway obligation limitation for 1998 than they were apportioned at the beginning of last fiscal year. That is some improvement in the money. 
In addition, we have included $300 million for Appalachian Development Highway System investment consistent with existing authorization. The Federal Government made a commitment to improve these highways which run through economically undeveloped areas in 13 of our States, and our bill helps to keep that commitment. This investment will pay off not only in economic development in areas that are in much need of it but also in lives saved since these highways in mountainous areas are often high-accident locations in our country. 
As most Senators know, Federal investment in airport development has been declining in recent years, and the administration proposed a further cut for the coming year. Our committee could not agree with that proposal at a time when air travel is increasingly in demand and air safety is uppermost in the minds of travelers. We have included $1.7 billion for the airport improvement program. 
Transit formula and discretionary accounts, including funding for Washington Metrorail construction, all of which are for capital investment in our bill, are funded at $4.56 billion, $311 million above fiscal year 1997. 
The bill provides $273 million for continued improvements on Amtrak's Northeast corridor between Washington and Boston. For other Amtrak capital expenditures, the bill makes a contingent appropriation, Mr. President, of $641 million to be funded from the intercity passenger rail fund, which would be established by S. 949, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. The Amtrak capital appropriation in this bill will be triggered when a final reconciliation bill including the passenger rail fund is enacted into law and the transportation subcommittee's 602(b) allocation is adjusted upward to cover the additional appropriation. 
Safety was a top priority as we developed this bill. It provides $5.376 billion for the FAA operations account, including funds for an increase of 235 aviation safety inspectors and 500 additional air traffic controllers. Our appropriations for FAA operations is 99.8 percent of the administration's request. The committee was able to fund the FAA's operation account at this level without imposing $300 million in new user fee taxes proposed in the administration's request. 
The toll of deaths and injuries on our highways, we believe, is too high and our bill addresses that. It funds the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Program at $333.5 million. That is a $33 million increase above the fiscal year 1997 enacted levels and slightly higher than the administration's request. 
This bill provides $50.7 million for the National Transportation Safety Board, 8 percent above the President's request, to support the NTSB's investigatory mission and to expedite the development of safety recommendations. 
The Coast Guard, as you know, Mr. President, also plays a critical role in the safe operation of our Nation's waterways. Its operations funding of $2.73 billion as provided in this bill is an increase of $112 million above fiscal year 1997. This level is consistent with the administration's request for operating expenses and will continue congressional support for a streamlined Coast Guard. 
Coast Guard funding includes an increase of $53 million for antidrug activities, which are coordinated by the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The committee has provided the Commandant of the Coast Guard the discretion and the flexibility to manage this funding but has encouraged the Department to look at these activities as areas that would benefit from the development of performance measures. 
The bill funds the Coast Guard's capital program at $412 million, an increase of $33 million above the administration's request. This provides the Coast Guard with the equipment, ships, and aircraft to complete their multiple missions. The Coast Guard's capital needs, especially for replacing aging vessels and facilities, will increase dramatically in the years ahead and the committee's recommendation focuses on those acquisition programs that can be accelerated now to provide room in the outyears to replace these assets. 
I note for the benefit of the Senators from States that depend on the Saint Lawrence Seaway, that this bill assumes enactment of the administration's proposal to convert the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation to a performance-based organization and to move its financing from appropriated funds to an automatic annual performance-based payment. No funds are included in this bill for the Seaway Corporation, but if the legislative proposal fails, we will ensure in conference that the Seaway Corporation is funded. 
The Senate has taken the lead in past years in promoting management reform at the Department of Transportation, especially at FAA. This bill continues that direction by refraining from micromanagement of the Department, even as we look for improved results. The committee report, for example, offers guidance to the Secretary of Transportation on improving on DOT's draft strategic plan which is required by the Government Performance and Results Act. It also avoids artificial caps on the efforts of the Department to act in a more businesslike way, but it directs the DOT Inspector General to study whether in fact DOT's new entrepreneurial service organization is provided cost-competitive, high-quality service. 
But, even as we addressed infrastructure investment and safety in this bill, we have been very mindful of the priorities that Senators had for this bill. We receive more than 900 requests for projects and provisions to be included in this bill. We have reviewed those requests very closely and accommodated them to the extent that we could. In some cases, available funding was not sufficient to fund all requests, and we had to make some tough choices. But we have tried to be as fair as possible to all Senators on both sides of the aisle. 
Many Senators wanted funds for highway projects of special interest to them in their States. This year, ISTEA reauthorization is providing a vehicle for special project funding, especially in the House where there is very active consideration of such funding. But I want to assure my colleagues this evening that I believe the Congress has at least as legitimate a role in designating funding for specific highway projects as it does in designating new transit projects that will be funded. I intend to review the situation after enactment of ISTEA reauthorization legislation and to work with my Senate and my House colleagues in the year ahead to ensure that we have an opportunity to designate funding for highway projects of special interest to our States and to our communities. 
I am proud, overall, of what we have been able to accomplish in this bill. It will benefit all Americans as it helps to improve transportation services in this country so that the economy and personal mobility are better served. I commend my colleague, the ranking Democrat on the committee and the former chairman on this committee, Senator Lautenberg, for all the hard work he has put in in this effort. 
At this time I yield to the ranking member, Senator Lautenberg.

Mr. SHELBY. I would like to respond to that. 
First of all, I want to acknowledge the work of the distinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, in bringing to my attention--and also to Senator Lautenberg's attention--the needs of his State in dealing with this economic development project. 
I did have the opportunity, at Senator Chafee's request, to meet with Senator Chafee, the Governor, and the junior Senator, Senator Reed, regarding this project. I also met with Senator Chafee on numerous occasions as we talked about, `Would funding for this project be included in the bill?' I assured him that it would, and for a good reason. 
This is a sound project for the people of Rhode Island. We investigated it on the committee and found that it makes a lot of sense. And as Senator Chafee has pointed out, the people of Rhode Island are also putting up a lot of money through a bond issue of $50 million. And $50 million is a lot of money for a State of around 1 million. And I want to acknowledge his work in this regard and say that we are pleased that we have been successful in identifying resources for this project. And I believe it is going to be very, very positive for the State of Rhode Island. 
I look forward to working with the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island in the future.  
Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, Senator Collins has been in touch with our subcommittee throughout the year as we prepared the 1998 Transportation appropriation bill. She has talked to us more than once. In particular, the Senator from Maine has made clear that securing available sources of funding for the NEPA study is a very high priority for her and the people in the northern part of her State of Maine. The Senator has also been a strong supporter of higher funding in fiscal year 1998 to meet other necessary transportation priorities on behalf of the State of Maine as well. 
Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to confirm the inquiry of the Senator and to reiterate that the State of Maine is clearly able to use highway funds provided in this act, subject to ISTEA reauthorization, to conduct a NEPA study. I believe that the Senator from Maine has made a compelling case for moving ahead with this study and, in fact, I believe that the NEPA study would be a good use of a portion of Maine's highway funding. 
Mr. President, Senator Collins has made it very clear to the subcommittee how important improving the travel corridor in northern Maine is, and I share her view that this NEPA study would be a very high priority for funding in 1998.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Resolution 98. The negotiations on limiting post-2000 emissions of greenhouse gas emissions, which are scheduled to conclude in December in Kyoto, Japan, will have a significant impact on all Americans. This resolution addresses concerns that the administration has chosen to ignore while pursuing an international agreement that will bind the United States for decades to come. 
Science should lead policy. Once again, the administration is pursuing an environmental policy that is based on insufficient research and analysis. Many in the scientific community believe that we are still years away from computer models that can confidently link global warming to human activity. Yet without strong scientific data, the administration is ready to commit the United States to binding actions that will impose economic and social burdens on every American. 
Recently, the Department of Energy released a report by the Argonne National Laboratory containing several troubling findings on the effects of the proposed treaty on our economy. Among the conclusions, the study found that without requiring developing countries to meet the same emissions standards as the rest of the world, up to hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs will move overseas to so-called developing countries that have refused to participate in any new climate agreement. Higher energy prices will lead manufactures to produce less at higher costs resulting in job loss, higher consumer prices and an inability to compete in a global marketplace. This will devastate our Nation. Yet, the administration is pushing to commit the American people to participate. 
The developed countries should not shoulder the responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions around the world. It seems obvious that in the long-run increasing emissions in developing countries will far outweigh any actions taken by the developed countries. Any binding actions by the United States must be accompanied by binding commitments from developing countries. I believe a majority of Americans would agree that devastating our Nation's economy by promoting industry flight overseas is not the answer to a global issue. 
The public has a right to know how the administration's commitments requiring them to reduce fossil fuel energy will be accomplished and how their lives, jobs, and futures will be affected. I am greatly disturbed that the administration has not sought, and therefore has not received, support from Congress or the American public on this matter. 
Mr. President, the American people deserve an open, objective and honest debate on the development of U.S. climate change policy. Without that, I can not and I will not support committing the United States to limiting post-2000 greenhouse gas emissions.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my continued support for the peanut program. 
Mr. President, just last year the Senate completed a comprehensive review of all federally sponsored farm programs. This review prompted extensive debate in this chamber--debate in which divergent positions were articulated and competing interests were expounded. Ultimately, after much hard work, consideration and compromise, the Senate produced the landmark 1996 farm bill. 
The farm bill sets Federal farm policy through the year 2002 and contains fundamental changes which have impacted every facet of Federal involvement in farm programs--from crop subsidies, conservation practices and rural subsidies to credit, research and trade policies. Included in this legislation were provisions that specifically covered the peanut program, provisions which made considerable changes to the program. 
This year, despite the significant work that went into putting the farm bill together, despite the fact that the farm bill reforms of the peanut program have only been on the books for little over a year and have only affected one crop, and despite the fact that thousands of farmers have made significant financial and farming commitments through the year 2002 in reliance upon the provisions of the farm bill, some Members have discussed undoing the work of the sponsors of the farm bill and dismantling the peanut program. 
Mr. President, I feel any attempt to change the peanut program is unnecessary, misguided, and would ultimately destroy American peanut farming and American peanut farmers. 
Mr. President, the peanut program helps support more than 16,000 family farmers, many of whom live in some of the poorest, most agriculturally dependent areas in the United States. Mr. President, the peanut program provides American consumers with a steady and large supply of safe and cheap peanuts and peanut products. 
Mr. President, the peanut program works for American peanut farmers and American consumers. It has been significantly revised in recent years and these revisions will only serve to enhance the program if allowed to stand. We must allow farmers who have relied on the farm bill an opportunity to work within the new peanut program.

Mr. SHELBY. If my colleagues would yield for a moment, I would like to endorse the well-reasoned recommendations made by the Senator for Kansas. The recently issued particulate matter rule is troubling given the scientific uncertainties and the significant costs that will be imposed on the government, citizens, and businesses in Alabama--and in the rest of the Nation--that are already struggling to meet the air quality standards required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The cost of implementing the new particulate matter standards is staggering, especially considering the questions that remain about the actual public health benefit. Further scientific examination of the matter is necessary prior to placing additional economic burdens on the American public. Premature implementation of the standards could be far more damaging to the Nation and I strongly recommend taking the time to fully review the scientific basis of the rulemaking.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, although the tax reconciliation bill promises to cut taxes by approximately $76 billion over 5 years and $238 billion over 10 years, it should be viewed as only a small step forward in providing tax relief to the American people. 
I remind my colleagues this afternoon that we must not forsake our broader agenda to seek comprehensive reform of our tax system. Piecemeal tax cuts are not, and I want to say it again, are not a substitute for broad-based tax reform. Therefore, I rise today to offer the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act which will scrap the entire Income Tax Code as we know it and replace it with a system that taxes all income once and only once at one low, flat rate of 17 percent. 
A flat tax, I believe, will correct the vast and pervasive problems of the current system. As illustrated before here, the complexity of Federal tax laws costs taxpayers approximately 5.3 billion hours to comply with the current Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Code is so complicated that even the IRS doesn't understand it. 
In 1993, the IRS gave 8.5 million wrong answers to taxpayers seeking assistance, and the IRS sent out 5 million correction notices which turned out to be wrong. 
In 1996, this past year, taxpayers spent a staggering $225 billion trying to comply with the Tax Code. Think about it--$225 billion in America spent by the taxpayers trying to comply with the Tax Code. This is a deadweight loss to the economy that is, as the Presiding Officer knows as a member of the Armed Services Committee, about equal to our national defense budget. 
We live in a society that accepts the notion that some level of taxation is necessary to finance the cost of Government, but it is important that it does no more harm than is necessary to achieve the stated goal. The current Tax Code is the product of a 40-year experiment with social engineering that has hampered the effort of the American people to be free, bear the fruit of their labor and ultimately live the American dream. 
Recently, the bipartisan national commission on restructuring the IRS came out with a report laying out their vision for a new and improved IRS. One of the key recommendations of this commission that was made was that simplification of the tax law is necessary to reduce taxpayer burden and to facilitate improved tax administration. 
We need to address significant tax policy changes that will not only provide taxpayers with relief, but will simplify and equalize the tax collection in this country. Taxation is bad enough without administering that tax through the inefficient, inequitable, and oppressive tax system that we have today. 
Rather than wading through stacks of complicated IRS forms and instruction manuals, under a flat tax taxpayers would file a simple, postcard-size return. When fully phased in, the family allowance would be $11,600 for a single person, $23,200 for a married couple filing jointly and $5,300 for each dependent child. 
These allowances will be indexed to inflation under our bill. For a family of four, this will mean that their first $33,800 of income would be exempt from taxation by the Federal Government, which will assure a progressive average rate for low-income households. 
The flat tax, I believe, will restore fairness to tax laws by treating everyone alike, regardless of what business they are in, whether or not they have a lobbyist in Washington or how much money they make. If you earn more, under the flat rate tax, you would pay more. Under the current system, one taxpayer may pay little or no taxes because they have paid an accountant or tax attorney to figure out the Tax Code for them. At the same time, another person with the same exact income but who does not have the professional assistance may pay much more in taxes. I say that is not fair. 
Under a flat tax, this would end. People would not have to hire an accountant or tax attorney simply to comply with the law. Everyone would fill out the same simple, postcard-size return. Everyone will be taxed at the same rate. And, yes, everyone will pay their fair share. 
Furthermore, the flat tax will eliminate the double taxation of savings and promote jobs and higher wages in this country. Because the flat tax applies a single low rate to all Americans, I feel it is the best replacement of the current system. I do not think that Americans should have to jump through hoops just to keep the money they have earned through their hard work. The current Tax Code basically says you can keep your money only if you do what we think you should do. This is not freedom; it is serfdom. The flat tax does away with Government micromanagement of people's personal lives and allows them to spend their hard-earned money as they see fit. 
But perhaps the most important virtue of the flat tax is that it supports the basic value of work, savings, and individual liberty. It has been a commitment to these principles that has made America the most successful economy in the world. In recent years, we have watched as the private sector has streamlined itself. I think it is now time for us to streamline the Tax Code.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Judge Donald H. Patterson who died at age 61 on May 28, 1997 after his courageous 7-month battle with lung disease. Donald Patterson was a friend, dedicated father and community leader who was respected by all who knew him. Judge Patterson honorably served the people of Lauderdale County, AL, as an elected judge in the 11th Judicial District of Alabama. 
Don grew up in Florence, AL and then received both his bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Alabama. Always a leader, Don was president of the student government association while at the university. Following his graduation from law school, Don served active duty in the U.S. Army, and later, 6 years in the U.S. Army Reserve. 
In 1959, Don began his law practice with Bert Haltrom. The two continued to practice until Bert Haltrom was appointed U.S. district court judge. Until Don's election to the circuit court in 1989, he practiced law with Florence attorney Gary Jester. 
Judge Patterson was a true gentleman and leader. His Christian values are reflected not only in the way he lived his life, but in the many organizations he led, belonged to and served. Until his passing, Judge Patterson was a member of the Alabama Judicial Study Commission and a director of the Alabama Circuit Court Judges Association. 
Additionally, Judge Patterson served as chairman of the Florence-Lauderdale Industrial Expansion Committee; director of the chamber of commerce; past president of the Florence Rotary Club, and a recipient of the Paul Harris Fellow of Rotary International Award. Furthermore, he served numerous other legal, civic, and Christian groups. 
Judge Patterson was a first-rate judge and lawyer--always very professional and knowledgeable. As a Sunday school teacher and past chairman of the board of the First Methodist Church of Florence, he was an exemplary citizen, leader, and role model. And as a husband, father, grandfather, and friend, Don was a compassionate and wonderful human being. 
My prayers go out to Don's family and friends. Don Patterson's lifelong dedication to community and country made our world a better place--he will be sorely missed.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased to inform my colleagues that today the Select Committee on Intelligence unanimously voted to favorably report the nomination of Mr. George J. Tenet to be the next Director of Central Intelligence. 
Although the committee held hearings in May, shortly after receiving the nomination from the President, the committee postponed final action pending the conclusion of a preliminary investigation by the Department of Justice. 
The Attorney General was required to make a determination of whether to recommend the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate allegations involving Mr. Tenet's financial holdings and disclosure. 
Today, the committee was officially notified that the Attorney General had concluded that no further investigation was warranted and that she would not seek appointment of an independent counsel. 
The Vice Chairman, Senator Kerrey, and I promptly convened a meeting of the committee and voted to favorably report the nomination to the full Senate. This prompt action by the committee, once the Justice Department investigation was completed, reflects the strong support Mr. Tenet has among the members of the committee. 
Mr. Tenet faces some daunting challenges as he prepares to officially assume the responsibilities of the Director of Central Intelligence. 
He must successfully guide the intelligence community toward new and far more difficult missions. He must ensure that the quality and integrity of his people remains high. 
He must provide thorough and unbiased analysis to this Nation's policy-makers and he must keep, as he has pledged, the Congress fully and currently informed of all intelligence activities. 
The latter point is very important, Mr. President, because the intelligence community, and specifically the Central Intelligence Agency, has not enjoyed a great deal of public support in recent years. 
It will be Mr. Tenet's responsibility to restore the public confidence in his organization, and he can do that by remaining faithful to the values of this Nation and by ensuring that the people's representatives are kept fully appraised of all the community's activities. 
The intelligence community is rich with outstanding Americans, many of whom risk their lives to protect the security of this Nation. These people place a great deal of trust in their leadership and it is up to Mr. Tenet to honor that trust. The committee believes that he will. 
Mr. President, it is with pleasure that I recommend, as chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, that the Senate unanimously approve the nomination of George John Tenet to the next Director of Central Intelligence.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the bill before the Senate tonight, promises to provide about $75.8 billion in tax relief over the next 5 years and approximately $238 over 10 years. Mr. President, that is a good step forward. But, Mr. President, I rise tonight to remind and encourage my colleagues that while this bill might be viewed as a good step forward in providing tax relief to the American people. It is just that: a step forward--hopefully, toward greater reform in the future. 
I will offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution for a very simple, but very important purpose: We must not forsake our broader agenda to seek comprehensive reform of our tax system. Tax cuts are not a substitute for broad based reform. 
Mr. President, while we live in a society that accepts the notion that some level of taxation is necessary to finance the cost of government, our challenge has always been how much government and at what cost. 
In my view, the power to tax is the most ominous and potentially destructive power granted to government by the people and that is because taxes empower governments, not people, With that in mind, our tax policy should do no more harm than is necessary to achieve its stated good. This maxim underscores why we need to change our current system, and specifically eliminate the estate and capital gains taxes. 
Our current tax system promotes waste and inefficiency, penalizes savings and investment and rewards dependency. Not only is the current Tax Code inequitable in who and how it taxes, it is responsible for fueling much of the growth of government and Federal spending. Changing how we collect revenue to pay for the cost of government will be a significant step in helping devolve power from Washington back to the people and restoring greater freedom. 
We need to address significant tax policy changes that will not only provide taxpayers' relief, but will simplify and equalize tax collection. Taxation is bad enough without administering that tax through an inefficient, inequitable, complex and unresponsive tax system. 
Yesterday, the National Commission on Restructuring the IRS came out with their report and recommendations. I have not had an opportunity to review their report completely, but I did note that simplification on the Tax Code was among one of their primary recommendations, including establishing one broad based tax system. 
While the Commission was not tasked and did not address specific legislative proposals to reform the tax system, I believe that the underlying principle of seeking a`truly fair and comprehensive' tax system is something we can all agree on And I would take this opportunity to commend my colleagues from Nebraska and Iowa for their leadership on this issue. 
While I believe a flat tax is the most equitable replacement that supports the most freedom at the least cost--this resolution is not an endorsement of the flat tax. It only calls for Congress and the President to move forward with consideration of broad based reform. 
While this bill attempts to reverse the punitive effects of our tax policy and tax system which currently punishes the basic values of work, savings and individual liberty, it is not sufficient to undo the basic premise that seems to underlie the current system and that is that the Government is entitled to all that you earn. And only through selected, targeted tax credits, deductions, exemptions and the like are the American people allowed to keep portions of the income that they work hard every day to earn. 
Our tax policy should support the most freedom at the least cost and embody the least intrusive means of levying and collecting taxes. But most importantly of all, Mr. President, we need a policy that does not punish the basic values of work, savings and individual liberty. 
Mr. President, without comprehensive tax reform, we will never truly be able to say that the era of big government is over. 
Mr. President, I would encourage my colleagues to join me and the Senator from Idaho in supporting this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the intelligence authorization bill is before the Senate at this time. 
This bill was unanimously voted out of the Intelligence Committee on June 4. It was then referred to the Senate Armed Services Committee and was favorably reported without amendment yesterday. 
This bill will authorize appropriations for intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the U.S. Government. I am pleased to report to the Senate today that I have worked very closely with Senator Kerrey, the vice chairman of the committee, in drafting this bill. We have crafted, Mr. President, what we believe is a bipartisan bill that received the full support of all Republican and all Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee. 
I am proud that the actions we have taken with this legislation are comprehensive and that we have taken some bold steps to implement four priorities to posture the intelligence community for the future. 
Mr. President, it is extremely fortuitous that we are bringing the intelligence authorization bill to the floor this week when we have seen a great intelligence success recently. It is not often that the dedicated men and women of our intelligence agencies enjoy public recognition for their work. They understand that. But yesterday, all Americans were gratified to learn of the successful apprehension of Mir Aimal Kansi and his transport to the United States to stand trial for the brutal murder of two CIA employees and the wounding of three others outside the CIA headquarters several years back. 
I am extremely proud of our intelligence community in their work here. The Kansi arrest was the result of over 4 years--4 
years--of painstaking and dedicated investigative and intelligence work by the CIA, the FBI, and others. 
Together with my colleagues on the Intelligence Committee, I was briefed on the details of this successful mission yesterday. While I cannot comment on the operation itself, I can share with my colleagues, as Senator Kerrey would, and the American people, that it was conducted with great professionalism and personal courage. 
The success of this operation should serve as a warning to others, those who in the past have attacked Americans and those who might be contemplating such actions, that America will take action to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice wherever they are and whatever the cost. 
To the families of those who died and to those who were wounded, we know that this arrest cannot return your loved ones or heal your wounds. We hope, however, that you derive consolation from seeing the accused killer brought to this country for trial. 
The legislation before us today is made up of words and numbers on paper. As yesterday's events remind us, the work of our intelligence and law enforcement professionals takes place in the real world, in flesh and blood. 
While the cold war is, indeed, over, there are still many forces in the world today that threaten our national security and our citizens and require the constant vigilance of our intelligence community. That is why we have authorized a significant level of funding for the continued operation of the intelligence community's activities. 
I believe it would be inappropriate, Mr. President, to reveal this exact level of funding, not because we do not want the American people to know how much is invested in intelligence activities for their protection, but, rather, we want to protect the level of our investments from foreign intelligence services and leaders of rogue states who would analyze trends in these investments to help guide their decisions about when to strike with terrorism or aggression against their neighbors, perhaps our own citizens. 
I now would like to take a few minutes to summarize the major priorities and the actions we have taken with this legislation. 
We have had to face some tough choices, as all of us have in the Senate, in the allocation of resources to meet the critical priorities that have been set for the intelligence community. 
In setting the authorization level for intelligence, we have looked across the combined request for intelligence that is broken up into three major categories, and they are the National Foreign Intelligence Program of the Director of Central Intelligence, the Joint Military Intelligence Program of the Secretary of Defense, and the Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities Program of the military services. 
The Intelligence Authorization Act includes authorization for each of these categories. With this legislation, Mr. President, we continue to lay the groundwork for the intelligence community of the 21st century, one that is retooled and I believe that is right-sized. 
In putting together this authorization, the committee identified nine key areas that will contribute to this effort. We drafted an authorization bill that will better focus, we believe, the intelligence community's resources on these areas. I call the first five areas the five C's: counterterrorism, counterproliferation, counternarcotics, counterintelligence, and covert action. In each of these areas our bill includes additional resources to aggressively tackle these difficult missions in the world. 
We also examined four other areas with a view toward long-term investments that would place our intelligence agencies on a stronger footing as we enter the 21st century. These included: A stronger commitment to advanced research and development to maintain our technological edge; improvement in the tools and skills of our clandestine service personnel; new approaches to infiltrating and assessing hard-target countries; and enhancements to our analytical and information warfare capabilities. 
We have put forward a balanced recommendation for the authorization of a Joint Military Intelligence Program that, among other things, includes sensor and engine upgrades for our airborne intelligence fleet of RC-135's; it continues the modernization of our manned reconnaissance capabilities; and pushes forward with the new technology of unmanned aerial vehicles. 
We have also taken some bold legislative initiatives in this bill. One area on which the Intelligence Committee focused was the need to ensure that classification of information is used effectively to protect sensitive sources and methods or other vital national security interests but does not prevent the flow of information to Congress or, where appropriate, to the American people. 
The committee has concluded that a higher priority is needed for the review and for the declassification of 
intelligence so that families concerned about the murder of a loved one overseas receive vital information consistent with national security concerns. The Committee on Intelligence recently heard from the families of several marines who were murdered in a terrorist attack in Zona Rosa, El Salvador, in 1985. A common refrain in their testimony before the committee was concern about how little information they received from their Government regarding the attack and its perpetrators. 
It was from network television, for example, that at least one family first learned of the attack and death of their brother or son. It was also from television broadcasts that several families learned years later that the likely mastermind of the attack had been brought into this country through the U.S. official channels. The committee has pressed the executive branch to provide these families with as much information as possible, but 12 years is a long time to wait. 
The committee believes, however, that it is the national interests of the United States to provide information regarding the murder or kidnapping of Americans abroad to their families consistent with intelligence operations. 
Moreover, given the difficulty inherent in identifying all relevant information that might be held by different elements of the Government and the likely resistance to providing information that is currently classified, the committee believes this important responsibility must ultimately be vested in a Cabinet-level official. 
Therefore, the committee has adopted a provision in this bill requiring the Secretary of State to ensure that all appropriate actions are taken within the Government to promptly identify relevant information pertaining to incidents of violence against Americans overseas. 
Mr. President, the Secretary is then required to make the information available to families to the maximum extent possible without seriously jeopardizing sensitive intelligence sources and methods or other national security interests. 
This provision, along with others contained in this bill, will enhance the intelligence community's working relationship with the American public that it serves. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998. 
Mr. President, I also want to remind my colleagues that a lot, if not most, of this bill is classified. But we have some security officers from the Intelligence Committee that are available here today, off the floor, to go into any aspect of the legislation that they think is pertinent.

Mr. President, the committee has received the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for S. 858. CBO found that the public bill would not affect direct spending or receipts in 1998; thus, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply to it. In addition, the Unfunded Mandates Reform act [UMRA] excludes from application of the act legislative provisions that are necessary for the national security. CBO determined that all of the provisions of this bill either fit within that exclusion or do not contain intergovernmental mandates as defined by UMRA.

I think just about everybody in the Senate would agree that whatever tax bill we enact this year should meet a standard of fairness in the distributional impact on all Americans, on upper, middle and lower taxpayers, as he is talking about. I have no quarrel with the amendment, the Wellstone amendment.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Torricelli amendment. I oppose the public disclosure of the overall level of intelligence funding as proposed by the amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. President, it does not, I repeat, it does not take an act of Congress to declassify the top line of the intelligence budget as this amendment would do if adopted. The President of the United States has always had and has today the authority to disclose this figure and has always chosen to keep it classified. 
Determining classification is the responsibility and is the duty of the Chief Executive of the United States, the President, who is also, as we know, the Commander in Chief. Presidents Truman through Clinton have determined this figure is to remain classified, and I believe we should not overrule that judgment. 
The purpose of maintaining a premier intelligence capability is to save lives and to prevent and, if we get in them, win wars. The foundation of an effective intelligence capability, as we all know, is secrecy. Secrecy protects not only the information that we collect, but also the brave people that put themselves at risk to do the collection of it. We are an open and a free society that generally abhors secret dealings by our Government. But in the case of intelligence collection and analysis, secrecy, I believe, is absolutely necessary. 
Some of my colleagues argue that the American people have a right to know how much of their money is being spent to defend their Nation's security through intelligence-gathering operations. I assert today that, through its elected officials, the public interests are being effectively served. As U.S. Senators, all of us we have been elected to represent the interests of our constituents and to act on their behalf. Therefore, the American people do know, in a sense, how much we spend on national security because their elected representatives know. As on many other issues, Mr. President, our constituents have a voice, and it speaks through the Senators and Representatives and the President of the United States. 
Some of my colleagues will argue that disclosing the total budget amount will instill public confidence and enable the American people to know what portion of the Federal budget is dedicated to intelligence activities. It appears there is general agreement that the details of the intelligence budget should remain classified, however. I believe that the total budget figure is of no use to anyone but to those who wish to do us harm. 
For example, what do the numbers tell our adversaries or potential adversaries in the world? In any given year, perhaps, not a great deal. But while watching the changes in the budget over time, and using information gathered by their own intelligence activities, sophisticated analysts can indeed learn a great deal. 
Trend analysis, Mr. President, you are familiar with, is a technique that our own analysts use to make predictions and to reach conclusions. There are hostile foreign intelligence agencies all over the world that are focused solely on gathering every bit of information that they can about our own intelligence-gathering operations and our capabilities. Their ultimate goal is to exploit weaknesses and to deny access and to deceive our own intelligence collectors. Denial and deception is already a serious concern for the intelligence community, and providing our enemies or potential enemies with any insight as to what we spend on intelligence will only make it worse, not better. 
Others will argue that the total budget figure is already in the public domain, and we should just acknowledge it. Mr. President, we never, never confirm or deny classified information that may have been published somewhere or spoken by someone. Classified information, as you well know, remains classified even if it wrongly makes it into the public domain. 
We will also, Mr. President, hear from those who say disclosure is required by the statement and account clause of the Constitution, article 1, section 9, clause 7. Mr. President, I assert today that the current practice is fully consistent with the Constitution, and it carries forward a tradition of secret expenditures dating back more than 200 years. As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court of the United States observed in the U.S. versus Richardson case, `Historical analysis of clause 7 suggests that it was intended to permit secrecy in operations.' 
Further, Mr. President, the figure is available to all Members of Congress, the U.S. Senate and, the U.S. House to review. 
As I reviewed the debate on this topic, I found a statement by my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, in 1993, with which I totally agree, and which is appropriate today. Senator Chafee, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, said, disclosing the top line budget figure would only `frustrate a curious public and politicize the intelligence budget.' 
He pointed out further, `What many proponents of disclosure want to do is to put a bull's-eye on the intelligence budget and hold it up as a target for public ridicule, recognizing full well that we cannot engage in a meaningful public debate regarding intelligence programs.' 
I assure you, Mr. President, once the overall number has been released, there would be efforts to amend the overall funding for intelligence in open session. I do not believe it would be good for the Senate, the House, or the American people. Otherwise, I believe President Clinton and Presidents before him would have already declassified the number which they have the right to do. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SHELBY. I will try to be brief. 
Mr. President, as former Director Woolsey of the CIA once said, `It is impossible to conduct a meaningful debate on the effects of such amendments without explaining the component parts of the intelligence budget.' 
Think about that a minute. How much is spent for the CIA? How much is spent for signals intelligence? How much are we spending on satellites, and so on? 
It is that discussion which creates the likelihood of disclosure of sensitive intelligence information that would be of benefit to our adversaries. 
Mr. President, there are many opportunities to debate and discuss the details of the intelligence budget among the Intelligence, Armed Services, and Appropriations Committees. We all do this. This is not a topic that goes unexamined by the people's representatives in the Senate or the House. 
Mr. President, the Senate Intelligence Committee was established to ensure vigorous oversight of our intelligence activities. I believe myself that the committee faithfully represents the American people. Our goal is to maintain a robust intelligence capability while ensuring that our intelligence activities are conducted in accordance with American values and constitutional principles. 
The members of the committee take their responsibilities very seriously, and I pledge to the American people that we will continue to represent the best interests of this Nation. 
Mr. President, our intelligence capabilities are a critical national asset and, as chairman of the committee, I will not support an effort to disclose classified information when there is no compelling argument to do so. Therefore, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the Torricelli amendment. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to express support for the Drug-Free Communities Act and I would like to commend its sponsors, Senators Grassley, Daschle, DeWine, and D'Amato for their efforts in developing this important legislation. 
Unfortunately, a recent poll conducted by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America indicated that younger and younger children are using drugs. This poll is only the latest evidence of a very disturbing trend of increasing drug use by young people. It is important that we act to stop drug use and to prevent the devastation that drug use will have on America's young people. 
The Drug-Free Communities Act is an important step in this effort. This legislation provides local community groups, who have proven track records addressing teen drug use, with the funding they need to really combat drug usage. The Drug-Usage Communities Act creates an advisory commission, consisting of local community leaders, who will oversee the program and make sure that funds are directed to those groups that are successful in fighting drug use by America's children. The act provides funding only to those groups that can match the Federal dollars with non-Federal funds, ensuring that viable community groups will participate in the program and sustain anti-drug efforts as the fight continues. Lastly, the Drug-Free Communities Act requires no new funding. Funds will come from the $16 billion Federal drug control budget. 
This legislation is extremely important to the war on drugs. With the latest news that our efforts are flagging, that children are giving in to the temptation of drugs, we must fight back. The drug dealers are not waiting to approach our children, they never hesitate to make a sale. We cannot delay in fighting for them. We must reinvigorate the effort to protect our children. We must pass the Drug-Free Communities Act.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to join with many of my colleagues in saluting a great friend, patriot, and statesman--the senior Senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond. Listening to the debate recently, I realized that many were speaking of their personal experiences while serving with Senator Thurmond. I, however, would like to share with my colleagues the greatest story I know about Senator Thurmond--the true story of his life. To me it illustrates one key thing: that the hallmark of Strom Thurmond's life has been his dedication to serving others. 
Senator Thurmond was born in 1902 and raised in Edgefield, SC. Following his graduation in 1923 from Clemson University, young Strom Thurmond began his career, first as a teacher and coach, then, at the age of 21, as an officer in the U.S. Army Reserve. Eventually, Senator Thurmond went on to become the county superintendent of education, city attorney, county attorney, State Senator and circuit judge of South Carolina. From 1942 to 1946, Senator Thurmond, along with millions of other brave young men, served in World War II. For his service in the American, European, and Pacific theaters, Senator Thurmond earned 5 battle stars and 18 decorations and medals, including the Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, the Purple Heart, and the Bronze Star for valor. Upon his return to South Carolina, Strom Thurmond was elected to serve as Governor of South Carolina. During his tenure as Governor, Senator Thurmond was a candidate for President of the United States. Five years later, in 1954, Strom Thurmond was elected as a write-in candidate for U.S. Senator and has served with distinction in this body as chairman of two prestigious committees, as well as serving as the President pro tempore. 
The many personal sacrifices that Senator Thurmond has made over the past nine decades demonstrate his respect for our institution of government and our Nation's history. He knows all too well that when one fails to stand for his principles, those principles will perish. And Strom Thurmond, as a young paratrooper, as a Presidential candidate, and now, as a U.S. Senator, stands--sometimes all alone--for the greatest principles on which America was founded. 
Strom even had to switch parties--not once, but effectively, twice, to keep advancing his strongly held principles and ideals. In a sense, though Senator Thurmond has been a Dixiecrat, a Democrat and a Republican, he has always been, most of all, a proud American. 
Strom Thurmond has witnessed incredible growth and change in our Nation and our world, and his knowledge of our past and vision for our future is crucial to our present. The Senator's strong leadership, patriotism, dependability, and devotion to duty is inspiring--and his stamina is legendary. The people of South Carolina are fortunate to have such an able gentleman represent them; we here in the U.S. Senate are lucky to stand with him; and all Americans should be grateful for Senator Thurmond's 41 years of service in the Senate and proud of his 94 years of service to this country.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Stealth Tax Prevention Act. Perhaps the most important power given to the Congress in the Constitution of the United States is bestowed in article I, section 8--the power to tax. This authority is vested in Congress because, as elected representatives, Congress remains accountable to the public when they lay and collect taxes. 
Last year, Mr. President, Congress passed the Congressional Review Act of 1996, which provides that when a major agency rule takes effect, Congress has 60 days to review it. During this time period, Congress has the option to pass a disapproval resolution. If no such resolution is passed, the rule then goes into effect. 
The Internal Revenue Service, as the President here knows, has enormous power to affect the lives and the livelihoods of American taxpayers through their authority to interpret the Tax Code. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act that I am introducing today, along with Senator Bond and Senator Hagel, will expand the definition of a major rule to include, Mr. President, any IRS regulation which increases Federal revenue. Why? Because we desperately need this today. 
For example, if the Office of Management and Budget finds that the implementation and enforcement of a rule has resulted in an increase of Federal revenues over current practices or revenues anticipated from the rule on the date of the enactment of the statute under which the rule is promulgated. Therefore, the Stealth Tax Prevention Act will allow Congress to review the regulation and take appropriate measures to avoid raising taxes on hard-working Americans, in most cases, small businesses. 
Mr. President, the Founding Fathers' intent, as you know, was to put the power to lay and collect taxes in the hands of elected Members of Congress, not in the hands of bureaucrats who are shielded from public accountability. It is appropriate, I believe, that the IRS's breach of authority is addressed, in light of the fact that we are celebrating this week Small Business Week. 
The discretionary authority of the Internal Revenue Service exposes small businesses, farmers, and others to the arbitrary whims of bureaucrats, thus creating an uncertain and, under certain cases, hostile environment in which to conduct day-to-day activities. Most of these people do not have lobbyists that work for them, other than their elected Representatives, the way it should be. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act will be particularly helpful in lowering the tax burden on small business which suffers disproportionately, Mr. President, from IRS regulations. This burden discourages the startup of new firms and ultimately the creation of new jobs in the economy, which has really made America great today. 
Americans pay Federal income taxes. They, Mr. President, as you well know, pay State income taxes. They pay property taxes. On the way to work in the morning they pay a gasoline tax when they fill up their car, and a sales tax when they buy a cup of coffee. 
Mr. President, average Americans in small businesses are saddled with the highest tax burden in our country's history. 
Allowing bureaucrats to increase taxes even further, at their own discretion through interpretation of the Tax Code is intolerable. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act will leave tax policy where it belongs, to elected Members of the Congress, not unelected and unaccountable IRS bureaucrats.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr President, today, I am pleased to join my colleagues and fellow Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus cochairs Senators Burns, Craig and Murkowski in introducing the Sportsmen' Bill of Rights Act of 1997. 
Hunting and fishing are traditions that have been an integral part of our history since the inception of our Nation and are among the most basic of our heritage. Through the ages, sportsmen have shown a deep respect and appreciation for the land and have made a concerted effort to wisely use our Nation's renewable natural resources. All across this country, very successful alliances have been formed between hunting and fishing enthusiasts and conservationists. Both are very concerned about protecting natural habitats, and when working together their force includes some 70 percent of the U.S. population. 
Today, millions of Americans participate in these venerable pastimes. Over 60 million Americans enthusiastically participate in fishing activities and 14 million citizens are licensed hunters. These recreational activities are a significant boost to many local and State economies, as well as the Nation. Sportsmen spent more than $67.9 billion last year on goods and services supporting an industry that employs more than a million people across the country. When discussing the contributions sportsmen have made to our Nation, often overlooked is the fact that sportsmen have carried the burden of financing fish and wildlife management and preservation through the years. 
America owes our sportsmen a debt of gratitude for their pioneering achievements on behalf of wildlife and habitat conservation. The Sportsmen's Bill of Rights recognizes the important role fishing and hunting play in our society by providing anglers and hunters with explicit access to public lands; opening the process of wildlife management and protecting the integrity of the sportsmen's trust funds. This bill ensures that hunting and fishing opportunities are considered in Federal land management decisions, and provides a clear procedure for Federal agencies to follow in their management of our Federal public lands. 
For too long, sportsmen have been unduly penalized from equitably sharing public land. This bill mandates that Federal agencies analyze the effects of potential hunting and fishing limitations prior to enacting new land use policies. Hunters and anglers should be granted the right to intervene in any civil action where law would limit the use of land for hunting and fishing. The provisions in the sportsmen's bill of rights assure that Federal agencies support, encourage and enhance the opportunities for fishing and hunting. 
While this bill promotes access to public lands, it recognizes the need for exceptions and exclusions due to national security concerns, public safety matters, emergency situations and policy reasons that are incompatible with hunting or fishing. This act cannot be used to force the opening of National Parks or monuments administered by the National Park Service to fishing or hunting and this legislation is not intended to place fishing and hunting above other land management priorities. The sportsmen's bill of rights is aimed at setting forth tangible management guidelines. 
Additionally, this year marks the 60th anniversary of one of our Nation's most successful Federal restoration programs, the Pittman Robertson Act. P-R, as it is often referred to, is a partnership created by the State fish and wildlife agencies and the funds 
provided by the anglers and hunters. Sportsman across the land have sponsored, supported and maintained the integrity of P-R throughout the last 60 years. The funds are raised through an excise tax on sportsman's goods and subsequently, placed in a fund to be allocated to the States yearly in accordance with statutory formulas. Today $357 million is raised for wildlife restoration through P-R funds in conjunction with the Dingell-Johnson Act and the Wallop-Breaux Act. 
Due to the congenial partnership of our Nation's hunters and anglers with Federal-State agencies, America's wildlife is thriving. For every taxpayer dollar invested in wildlife conservation, sportsmen and women contribute $9 dollars. At the turn of the century, only 41,000 elk were counted across our Nation. While the Nation's population soared and massive development occurred, sportsmen's conservation initiatives have enable the elk population in just 10 western States to increase to approximately 810,000. Similar stories can be applied to numerous species including the white-tailed deer, the Canada goose, and the wild turkey. Hunters and anglers have been and will continue to be the champions of wildlife and habitat conservation. These examples just begin to demonstrate the value of anglers and hunters to our society. 
The sportsmen's bill of rights will protect and enhance sportsmen's opportunities and enhance the conservation of wildlife. I urge my colleagues to join me by cosponsoring this important legislation.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of condition 9 of the resolution of ratification of the CFE Flank Agreement. 
Condition 9 simply confirms the Senate's role in treatymaking, as established in the U.S. Constitution and reaffirmed in existing law. 
Specifically, condition 9 restates the requirement, enacted as section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995, Public Law 103-337, that:  
The United States shall not be bound by any international agreement entered into by the President that would substantially modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is entered pursuant to the treaty making power of the President under the Constitution. 
Thus, this body is already on record supporting the preservation of the Senate's constitutional prerogatives in this area. 
In other words, the President may not unilaterally negotiate substantive changes to the ABM Treaty without the advice and consent of the Senate. 
Frankly, I am surprised some of my colleagues, who in the past have been strong supporters of this body's constitutional prerogatives with respect to treaties in general, and the ABM Treaty in particular, are arguing to strike condition 9. 
Not only do the Constitution and U.S. law require Senate advice and consent, but submission to the Senate is also consistent with recent practice on the multilateralization of arms agreements with the Soviet Union to include successor states. 
Both the multilateralization of START I and the multilateralization of the CFE Treaty were considered by the Senate when it acted on the Lisbon protocol and the CFE Treaty itself. 
Mr. President, some of my colleagues argue that the multilateralization of the ABM Treaty is not a substantive change. 
Consider the following: 
The proposed changes would alter the basic rights and obligations of the parties--the central issue in any contract or treaty. 
Second, the proposed changes would modify the geographic scope and coverage of the Treaty, and would do so by taking the extraordinary step of defining Russia's national territory to include the combined territory of other independent states of the former Soviet Union. 
Third, the role and function of the Standing Consultative Commission [SCC], in particular the ability of the United States to negotiate amendments to the treaty to protect our national interests, would be dramatically changed by the accession of new parties to the treaty with effective veto power over treaty amendments. 
Lastly, some of my colleagues have cited a Congressional Research Service legal analysis that seems to suggest that the Senate has no role in the process. 
In response, I would like to point out that: 
The CRS analysis concludes that an apportionment of the rights and obligations of the U.S.S.R. under the ABM Treaty to its successor states would not, in itself, seem to require Senate participation. 
The CRS analysis goes on to say, however, `arguably, a multilateralization agreement could include matters that would alter the substance of the ABM Treaty and require Senate advice and consent.' 
The administration's proposal clearly falls into the latter category. 
It does much more than merely apportion the rights and obligations of the U.S.S.R. 
It apportions some rights to some successor parties--but denies them to others, in effect creating two classes of parties. This asymmetry and lack of reciprocity represents a clear departure from both the legal and strategic assumptions embodied in the initial treaty. 
It specifically permits Russia to establish ABM facilities on the territory of other independent states. This is not an apportionment; this creates a new right under the treaty. 
The administration proposal admits to the treaty states which neither have nor intend to have offensive or defensive strategic weapons, while giving them virtual veto rights over the strategic posture of other parties. 
This brings me to the most important point: The administration's proposal affects the rights of the United States to provide for our own defense as we see fit. 
It was to protect those rights that the Senate was given its advice and consent role in the first place. The Senate must not abdicate its role, now. 
I urge my colleagues to support this provision.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I want to briefly state my views on the Warner amendment. 
Let me first make it clear that I represent a donor State. From 1992 to 1995, Alabama only received about 78 cents back for every dollar it sent to Washington in gasoline taxes. Other States, like Massachusetts for example, received about $2 1/2 back for every dollar paid in gas taxes. The formula for distributing highway funds is not equitable in my opinion. I think it would be very difficult for any Member to argue that wealthier States should receive more than double in Federal highway funds than they paid in, while poorer States only receive a fraction of their contributions. I want to work to help correct that formula, but that is something that will be addressed later this year when the Federal highway program is reauthorized. 
My goal in the supplemental appropriations bill was not to try to tackle the donor versus donee issue. As I said before, that will be done in the authorizing committee later this year. Rather, my goal was to simply increase Federal funding for highways to address current and pressing needs and to ensure that all States would come out a winner. We did that. Under this legislation, donor States received an increase in their highway funds compared to fiscal year 1996 levels. Nondonor States, on the other hand, were given additional funds to ensure that they would not be cut below their 1996 levels. Again, nondonor States received their 1996 level of highway funding and donor States received an increase from their 1996 level. All in all, this bill provides States with an additional $933 million in new Federal highway money, and it does so in a way in which every State comes out a winner. In my view, that is a major victory for transportation in America, and it sets the stage for the authorizing committees to resolve the contentious allocation issue later this year. 
I support more money for donor States, but the Senate, the Appropriations Committee, and the Transportation Subcommittee are made up of more than donor States. I am not sure of what the outcome will be today, but even if the Warner amendment fails, there is no question that the additional funds in the committee bill represent a major victory for donor States, and I will strongly support its passage.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his assistance with several issues affecting the U.S. courthouse to be constructed in Montgomery, AL. Last fall, $6 million was included in Public Law 104-208 to help offset cost escalations resulting from: An error made by GSA during its Time Out and Review exercise; inflation; required security upgrades; historic preservation; and, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning improvements. 
Because this supplemental project funding cannot be obligated by GSA without authorization by the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I have worked closely with Senator Chafee and other members of the authorizing committee to secure their approval. Appropriately, Senator Chafee and others wanted to make sure that this additional funding would not cause the project in Montgomery to exceed the GSA benchmarking and project budgeting process. At my and Senator Chafee's request, GSA confirmed in a letter dated April 21, 1997, that this additional $6 million will not cause the Montgomery project to exceed its benchmark. That is, this additional funding is necessary for GSA to complete the very critical and basic features of a modern courthouse facility.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of verification, and in opposition to the motion to strike condition No. 33 contained in the resolution of ratification, relating to effective verification. 
I have a number of serious concerns with respect to the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, however, I have a particular responsibility to ensure that any treaty ratified by this body can be effectively verified by the intelligence community. 
If it cannot be verified, the CWC could become the means by which CWC member states, such as China and Iran, expand and enhance--rather than renounce--their CW capabilities. 
In negotiating the INF Treaty, ratified in 1988, President Reagan set forth an eminently reasonable standard to guide the negotiation and implementation of arms control agreements. `Trust,' he said, `but verify.' 
But I am afraid that the critical, second part of President Reagan's formula seems to have been forgotten with respect to this treaty. The CWC, and especially the verification regime, is based on the triumph of hope and trust over experience and history. 
In its efforts to obtain ratification, the administration has--if I may borrow a phrase from a former vice-chairman of the committee, Senator Moynihan--`defined verification down.' 
Condition No. 33 to the resolution of ratification seeks to correct that problem. 
It conditions deposit of the U.S. instrument of ratification on a Presidential certification to Congress that the treaty is effectively verifiable. 
This term, as used in the resolution, contains the following elements, based on the traditional definition of `effective verification': 
A `high degree of confidence' in our ability to detect, 
`Militarily significant violations'--meaning one metric ton or more of chemical agent-- 
`In a timely fashion,'--meaning detection within 1 year--and 
Detection of `patterns of marginal violation over time.' 
Effective verification is ultimately a political judgment that must be made by the President and his national security advisors. However, a key input to this decision is the judgement of the intelligence community. 
It is currently impossible to reconcile the above definition of `effective verification' with the intelligence community's own statements over the past 4 years, which is why condition 33 calls for a new Presidential certification., 
I would like to briefly restate the intelligence community's key conclusions as to the verifiability of the CWC, as set forth in recently declassified material from the National Intelligence Estimate of August 1993: 
The capability of the Intelligence Community to monitor compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is severely limited and is likely to remain so for the rest of the decade. 
Our intelligence community is the most capable in the world today. It enjoys extensive resources, and employs an impressive variety of assets to collect information affecting our national security. 
Yet with all of the sophisticated assets at our disposal, we cannot be confident of verifying this treaty. 
And some of the most promising new intelligence methods which might have improved this score over the last 4 years, have been significantly underfunded by this administration. 
We should look to the certification required by condition 33 as an opportunity for the President to tell us of his plans to invest in improvements to our technical collection capabilities to enable effective verification. 
Therefore I strongly support condition 33 of the resolution of ratification, and oppose the motion to strike. 
While most will acknowledge that we do not have the technical intelligence capabilities currently in place to provide effective verification, the proponents of the treaty place great stock in the contribution of the verification mechanisms contained in the treaty. 
For example, the creation of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], and the ability of OPCW inspectors to carry out challenge inspections of suspected violations, are cited as evidence for a mechanism of effective verification. 
Yet in an unclassified excerpt from the 1993 NIE on verification, the intelligence community states that: 
The key provision of the monitoring regime--challenge inspections at undeclared sites--can be thwarted by a nation determined to preserve a small, secret program by using the delays and managed access rules allowed by the convention. 
Those, Mr. President, are not my words. Those are the words of the intelligence community describing its ability to monitor compliance with the treaty before us. 
I should point out to my colleagues, in light of the fact that the National Intelligence Estimate from which I have quoted is dated August 1993, that the Acting Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, and other intelligence officials have confirmed on numerous occasions that the key judgments cited above are unchanged.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act. 
With the end of the cold war, we live in a much safer, but still unstable, world. Without the bi-polar domination of two superpowers, we now face a world comprised of many nations that have gained power on the world stage by producing a relatively inexpensive means of war. 
Among the most deplorable methods of war-making known to the world, chemical and biological weapons are horrific tools of mass destruction. 
Long ago, the United States discontinued and dismantled its biological weapons program and is currently unilaterally destroying its stockpile of poison gas. We would hope that other nations would follow suit, and destroy these weapons as well. 
However, there are rogue States that are pursuing dangerous weapons programs contrary to international norms against the use and stockpiling of biological and chemical weapons. 
Some countries are even suspected of pledging to ratify international agreements, while secretly continuing to develop and stockpile these lethal weapons. 
One significant problem in the fight against chemical and biological weapons is the stunning lack of enforcement of existing international protocols. 
International agreements, such as the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, ban the use of poison gas in war and prohibit the acquisition, development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons. However, they have not been used as an effective deterrent. 
For example, as the world watched with horror and disbelief when Iraq used poison gas against its own nationals, the community of nations failed to punish the perpetrators of this act. 
In addition, there is currently no U.S. law which provides criminal or civil penalties relating to the use of these weapons in the United States. 
Therefore, with the hope of reinforcing U.S. international leadership on chemical and biological weapons, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act. 
This legislation demonstrates our firm commitment to destroy U.S. chemical weapons, setting a strong example for other countries to follow. 
Further, this initiative reinvigorates U.S. efforts to enforce existing international prohibitions against chemical weapons, provides strong deterrence, and sends a clear message to nations around the world that the United States will not tolerate the use of these weapons. 
Specifically, the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act sets out civil and criminal penalties for the acquisition, possession, transfer, and use of chemical and biological weapons. 
This legislation mandates the death penalty where the use of these weapons leads to the loss of life and provides for a $100,000 penalty for civil violations. 
The Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act requires enhancements to U.S. chemical and biological defenses to protect our military men and women. Further, it would require U.S. sanctions, termination of foreign assistance, and suspension of diplomatic relations against any country that uses chemical and biological weapons against another country or its own people. 
The Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act provides concrete and achievable measures to reduce the threat of these abhorrent weapons. It is the best thing we can do to protect our country, our allies, and our world from any future atrocities caused by the use of chemical and biological weapons. 
I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to express support for Judge Roy S. Moore. Judge Moore is a judge on the circuit court of the State of Alabama. Judge Moore is a lifelong resident of Etowah County, a graduate of the United States Military Academy, a distinguished veteran of the Vietnam War, and a graduate of the University of Alabama School of Law. Judge Moore has always and continues to serve his community, Alabama, and this country with distinction and principle. 
It is because of his principles that Judge Moore has become an issue. Two years ago, Judge Moore was sued by the Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union because he opened his court with a prayer and because he displayed the Ten Commandments over his bench. A lower court judge enjoined Judge Moore from praying before court sessions and later barred his display of the Ten Commandments. The Supreme Court of Alabama has since issued a stay of the order barring display of the Ten Commandments. 
Judge Moore has refused to acknowledge the orders which stop him from praying and displaying the Ten Commandments. I support Judge Moore in his actions. I do not believe that his convocation prayer or the presence of the Ten Commandments in the courtroom violates the Constitution. 
As the Members of this body well know, a prayer, said from the floor of this Chamber, begins every day in which the Senate is in session. This practice is also followed in the House of Representatives. Furthermore, the Marshal of the Supreme Court, in calling each session to order, implores `God {to} save the United States and this honorable court.' It has also become a tradition for Presidents to conclude their State of the Union Addresses with the simple prayer, `God Bless America.' I believe these are just a few of the many instances where the Lord is invoked during civil ceremonies and occasions. I believe that these examples are entirely appropriate and in line with the provisions of the Constitution. I feel that our history teaches that the Founding Fathers were against government making efforts to promote specific religions at the expense of others. I do not think it was ever the view of the Founders that the government should adopt a position of Godless neutrality. It is constitutional, it is traditionally appropriate and it is just simply right for our leaders to request the assistance of God in their daily deliberations. 
I believe that Judge Moore is also correct in refusing to remove the Ten Commandments from his courtroom. The Judge's display is consistent with other displays involving religious symbols and art in or on public property. In fact, a door to the Supreme Court of the United States bears two tablets numbered one to ten, which I interpret to represent the Ten Commandments. Moreover, there are friezes within the Supreme Court which depict Moses, King Solomon, Confucius, Mohammed, St. Louis and a figure called `Divine Inspiration.' I believe that these symbolic representations, just like Judge Moore's, are appropriately placed within our public spaces. Their very presence provides guidance and inspiration for our Nation's leaders.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, for his many years of effort to reform our campaign system. His commitment to this endeavor is principled and longstanding. 
I have supported the Senator's efforts in the past, cosponsoring and voting for his legislation that would amend the first amendment of the Constitution to allow Congress and the States to limit the amount of money spent on political campaigns. 
Mr. President, with all due respect to his efforts and my past efforts, however, I rise today to speak in opposition to the Senator's proposed constitutional amendment. 
I have supported the Senator from South Carolina's effort in the past because I believed then, as I do now, that we need to improve our current campaign system. But, in my zeal for reform, I ignored what was really at stake. 
Over the past weeks, however, after much thought and consideration--after many discussions with constituents and reviewing the writings of many constitutional scholars, all of who support campaign finance reform--I have come to the conclusion that amending the first amendment would be far worse than the current situation. 
Indeed, if we passed a constitutional amendment to amend the first amendment to solve our current campaign finance problems, the cure would be worse than the disease. 
Mr. President, the proposed constitutional amendment simply takes away too much--the cost is too high and the risks too great. 
The first amendment is properly viewed as one of the most sacrosanct bundle of rights protected under the U.S. Constitution and this proposed resolution would strike at the heart of the first amendment--core political speech. 
Mr. President, to support such a repeal, is to threaten the very breath of every other right protected under the Constitution--and then nothing is sacred, nothing is sure, nothing is protected. 
Without free speech, liberty has no meaning. 
And this amendment would seek to do what the Supreme Court has said cannot be done under the first amendment of our Constitution. 
In 1974, in the seminal case of Buckley versus Valeo, the Supreme Court as the Presiding Officer knows, struck down the Federal Election Campaign Act's expenditure limits on candidates, individuals, and groups on first amendment grounds--finding that the Government's interest in, among other things, reducing the appearance of corruption was insufficient to justify restricting core political speech and expression. 
Mr. President, the question facing the Supreme Court was, at bottom: `whether a person can be prohibited from spending money to communicate an idea, belief, or call to action'? The Court's answer was `no.' 
Since Buckley, the Court has consistently found that the first amendment protects political speech and expression rights from intrusive government restrictions such as campaign spending limits. 
In FEC versus National Conservative Political Action Committee the Court again struck down spending limits. This time, reaffirming that restrictions on independent expenditures by political committees on publicly funded presidential general election campaigns violate the core of the first amendment's protections. 
More recently, in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee versus FEC, the Court found that political party expenditures made without coordination of a candidate were entitled to first amendment protection as independent expenditures. 
The Court rejected the argument that independent expenditures threaten corruption or give the appearance of corruption. 
Mr. President, this amendment is about more than just overturning one Supreme Court case, it is about overruling a whole line of first amendment case law. 
Over the years, the Court has made it clear that the Buckley decision was not some fluke. In fact, Buckley has been reaffirmed many times over. The answer should not be to undo the first amendment because it is viewed as an impediment to reform. 
There are better, perhaps more realistic and more effective ways of addressing the problems in our campaign finance system. 
Mr. President, I believe that changes can be made to improve our current system and I intend to support efforts to reform our current campaign finance system. 
But first, we need to start by enforcing current law, especially in regard to foreign contributions. No foreign contributions should be allowed to influence our political process. 
It is important to remember that adopting this amendment won't do anything to address the abuses that have recently come to light regarding the White House, DNC fundraisers and foreign influence. Existing laws were broken in accepting foreign contributions. 
However, we all know that our current laws are not sufficient. We need to target abusive practices which both parties agree should be eliminated. 
And, Mr. President, I believe that one of the most far reaching and important changes we can make in the system we have today is to demand full disclosure of all campaign contributions and expenditures. 
The public has a right to know where all funds in the political system come from and where they go. 
I also remain fully opposed to any form of public financing of political campaigns and intend to fight efforts to shift the cost and effort of running for public office from political candidates to the taxpayer of America. 
I find it offensive that some would argue that the only way we can purify the political process and eliminate the appearance of corruption is to launder campaign funding through the U.S. Treasury. 
American taxpayers should not be forced to pay for political campaigns. We have public financing of Presidential campaigns now, and you can see how effective that was in reducing corruption or the appearance of corruption in the last election. 
Mr. President, reform cannot and should not come at the expense of the public, and yet the reform proposals now being put forth would first rob American citizens of their first amendment rights under the Constitution and then require them to pay for the cost of political campaigns. 
What a deal. Reform could not be easier--for the political establishment. 
This amendment has serious ramifications beyond the immediate restrictions placed on an individual's rights to free speech and expression. This amendment also threatens the power of the American people over their Government. 
By restricting the right to speak freely and to participate in the political process, we restrict our rights to political debate and reduce our ability to control and check our Government. In fact, we give up even the pretense of 
self-government. 
I would rather be criticized for changing a position than forever limiting the rights of Americans to speak, to argue, and to participate in the world's oldest constitutional democracy. 
Again, I sincerely commend my friend and colleague, Senator Hollings, for his effort and commitment to campaign finance reform, but I wish he would reconsider, as I have, his commitment to change the first amendment. I think it would be a mistake now. I yield the floor.  
Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to give to the Senate the status on the confirmation process in the Intelligence Committee of Anthony Lake, who has been nominated by President Clinton to be the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
As I have said on many occasions, I intend to treat the confirmation of Anthony Lake, President Clinton's nominee to be Director of Central Intelligence in a serious, thorough and fair manner. 
The Central Intelligence Agency and the intelligence community deserve a strong and independent leader to carry them into the 21st century. I believe that everyone in the Senate recognizes that. 
This leader must be able to guide the fine men and women that serve our country and keep watch on our adversaries, sometimes under the most trying and dangerous of circumstances. 
And, this leader must be deserving of the confidence of the President, the Congress, and the American people. 
This is a controversial nomination, we have known this from the beginning. And it is essential that we address all of the issues associated with Mr. Lake's fitness to lead the intelligence community, and his ability to make the transition from White House insider to apolitical provider of intelligence information. 
I'd like to comment on the six areas in which the committee has considerable work to complete as we proceed with Mr. Lake's confirmation hearings which will begin on Tuesday. We want to get the process moving, but it is important that we have the fullest cooperation from the White House. 
These six areas are, among others: First, investigation of the role the National Security Council, under Mr. Lake's leadership, had in questionable DNC fund-raising practices, as well as any knowledge Mr. Lake may have had, if any. 
Second, Mr. Lake's use and interpretation of intelligence provided to him as National Security Advisor, including how he helped translate this intelligence into administration policy. 
Third, the Justice Department's settlement of Mr. Lake's ethics violations and the potential irregularities in this settlement. 
Fourth, the way in which Mr. Lake handled the `no instructions' policy toward Iranian arms shipments through Croatia to Bosnia. 
Fifth, review of Mr. Lake's FBI background investigation. 
Sixth, review of written answers Mr. Lake provided to the committee's questions for the record, many of which require further explanation than was provided.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, these allegations about Ms. Kanchanalak, coupled with her interactions with the National Security Council, are very troubling to me and other members of the Committee. We must fully understand what part, if any, Mr. Lake played. 
And while Mr. Lake has said that the NSC involvement with the individuals in question was `from a foreign policy rather than a domestic political point of view,' the material he provided to the committee gives some indications otherwise. 
For example, Mr. Lake advised the President against a meeting with Chinese nationals set up by Charlie (Tree) Trie, a major DNC fundraiser, based on the recommendation of his staff that it not take place for political reasons. 
And when asked about providing photos of the President with Chinese nationals identified as major DNC contributors, a member of Mr. Lake's staff commented on balancing foreign policy considerations against domestic politics. He did not seem to be bothered by the fact that Chinese nationals were identified as major DNC contributors. Clearly, this is an indication of possible illegal activity. 
Before questioning Mr. Lake about his leadership in these areas, we intend to question his staff further as to the role the NSC played in interactions with and vetting of these DNC contributors and foreign nationals. 
Senator Kerrey, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and I have requested that the NSC staff be available for the interviews on the record prior to the formal hearings, which will begin, as I have said earlier, next Tuesday. We reserve the right to call NSC staff members to testify under oath, if we deem that in order. 
The use of intelligence is another area. 
One of the key responsibilities of the Director of Central Intelligence is to provide unbiased intelligence to the President and to the Congress. Thus, it is very critical that we examine Mr. Lake's record as a consumer of such intelligence. 
How did he translate intelligence into policy at the NSC? 
Did he ignore intelligence estimates, spin them to fit administration policy, or raise the standards of evidence? 
We have concluded our investigation surrounding the administration's use of intelligence in shaping policy toward China, and there are some serious inconsistencies. We are prepared to discuss these with Mr. Lake in the closed session of the committee. 
Mr. President, given the allegations mentioned in every newspaper about Chinese involvement in DNC fundraising, this is an area for some serious questioning about potential influences on policy, and it should be. 
For example, there are still documents we wish to review as to the role intelligence played in our policy toward the Government of Haiti. The administration has consistently refused to transmit this information to Congress. Senator Kerrey and I have requested these documents, and we are still awaiting the National Security Council's response. 
We are also reviewing United States knowledge and assessment of recent events in Iraq and their impact on our policy there and how Mr. Lake used this knowledge in formulating that policy. We are pursuing similar questions in areas relating to Cuba, Somalia, Bosnia, and Pakistan. 
Ethics violations is another area we are pursuing. 
While the Justice Department has reached a settlement with Mr. Lake regarding his failure to sell energy stocks that were deemed to create a conflict of interest for him, resulting in a payment of a $5,000 fine by Mr. Lake, the Committee on Intelligence has been investigating this matter further. 
Although Mr. Lake claims that the failure to sell stocks was a simple oversight, Justice Department investigators interviewed by the committee documented 14 occasions over a 2-year period on which Mr. Lake was reminded that he still owned the stocks. It was only after a White House ethics officer discovered the stocks on his financial disclosure form for a third time that Mr. Lake did divest himself of the investments. Thus, a key question is whether this violation represents financial mismanagement on the part of Mr. Lake or a complete disregard for the seriousness of the ethics standards applied to all Federal employees. 
Additionally, what example does this set for the intelligence community professionals who must be held to the highest standards of personal conduct? 
The Intelligence Committee is also investigating the thoroughness of the Justice Department's investigation into Mr. Lake's stocks, particularly those energy-related stocks which created a conflict of interest and subsequent fine. Given that Mr. Lake garnered a profit of over $25,000 on these investments, I have trouble, as other members of the committee do, understanding the Justice Department's arbitrary fine of $5,000, which is the maximum allowed, I understand, for a potential misdemeanor offense. 
If the case, on the other hand, had been referred to the Justice Department's civil division, a much greater fine of up to $50,000 per offense could have been imposed. Why wasn't this course taken? We do not know, but we will pursue it. 
Iran-Bosnia and the `no instructions' policy. 
A key criterion for a Director of Central Intelligence is the extent to which he or she can gain the confidence of the Congress in keeping Members fully and currently informed of intelligence community actions. Mr. Lake's role in the execution of the secret `no instructions' policy toward Croatia allowing Iranian arms to flow into Bosnia and the decision, Mr. President, not to inform Congress of this action has called into question Mr. Lake's ability to be forthright with the Congress. 
The distinguished former chairman of the Intelligence Committee, my colleague and an expert in the area, Senator Specter, has raised serious questions regarding this matter which we intend to explore fully during our hearings. 
While Mr. Lake has admitted that it was wrong not to inform Congress of the `no instructions' policy, there remains a number of inconsistencies in testimony before both Houses of Congress as to the extent of the policy decision and its implementation. The Intelligence Committee is working with other congressional committees to review pertinent testimony and decide on an appropriate panel of witnesses to pursue this matter during Mr. Lake's confirmation hearings. The Senate confirmation hearings will represent the first time that Mr. Lake will testify under oath on his role in the development and execution of this policy. 
As to the FBI background investigation, there has been no resolution regarding requests made by me and a large number of my colleagues to review Mr. Lake's complete FBI background file. Negotiations between White House Counsel Charles Ruff, Senator Kerrey, and I are continuing. 
A significant number of my colleagues have written the distinguished majority leader stating that they need to review the complete background investigation before they would be prepared to vote on this nomination. Our thorough review of Mr. Lake's background investigation, I believe, is key to a fundamental understanding of Mr. Lake's character and integrity, 
as it would be for anyone else. 
Finally, the committee is reviewing information provided by Mr. Lake in response to questions propounded by the committee earlier. We require some clarifications to Mr. Lake's answers, and therefore additional questions have been put forward that must be addressed. 
There are some areas where we are requesting additional supporting documentation to Mr. Lake's answers, such as his financial disclosures and issues associated with a potential conflict of interest, and we will request for the committee a review of material that was redacted for various reasons. 
I thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity to provide the Senate with a status of the Lake confirmation process and an opportunity for me to lay out some of the concerns that I and some of my colleagues have about this nomination. We intend to work through each of these issues in a fair and a thorough manner and look forward to questioning Mr. Lake and others beginning next Tuesday, March 11.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, thank you. 
Mr. President, as we debate the balanced budget amendment, we would be wise to listen to the words of one of our Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson. Mr. Jefferson once wrote that `the question whether one generation has the right to bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves.' 
Mr. President, I agree with Thomas Jefferson: It is morally wrong for one generation to burden a future generation with its debts. Yet, that is exactly what has happened during the past 27 years in America. The Federal budget has not been balanced since 1969, and as a result, our national debt has grown to more than $5 trillion. In fact, a child born in America today begins life with a $20 thousand share of the national debt. During his or her lifetime, that child can expect to pay $187 thousand in taxes just to cover the interest payments on this debt--debt he had nothing to do with creating, but debt which will substantially limit his opportunities in life. 
Mr. President, just look at the strain current interest payments are putting on our national resources. Interest payments consume about 15 percent of the Federal budget, and they are now the third largest item in the budget--only Social Security and defense are larger. Last year, we spent a record $241 billion on interest payments to service the national debt. That is more than double the amount of money the Government spent on education, training, crime, and transportation combined. 
Mr. President, we cannot afford to continue wasting the taxpayers money in this fashion. This must stop, and the balanced budget amendment will help stop it by ending deficit spending and the growing interest payments on the national debt. 
However, the opponents of a balanced budget amendment have put forth many false arguments to try to confuse the issue. I want to address several of these arguments one by one. 
The most deceptive argument opponents of a balanced budget amendment use is that this amendment will hurt the Social Security system, unless Social Security is specifically exempted from the amendment. Mr. President, nothing could be farther from the truth. If the Social Security system is left as the only area of the budget which does not have to come into balance, then future Congresses will have a tremendous incentive to take the FICA revenues, which currently fund the Social Security system, and use them to help fund all other areas of the budget which must be balanced. That would leave the Social Security system in serious financial trouble. 
Second, exempting Social Security from the balanced budget amendment would further threaten Social Security by allowing Congress to move programs out of the area of the budget which must be balanced and into the exempt Social Security system. This would be a heavy drain on the money originally collected for Social Security. 
Finally, the whole point of the balanced budget amendment is to put an end to deficit spending. But, as the Social Security trustees tell us, there are massive deficits projected in the system in just a few short years. Therefore, while the rest of the budget is balanced, the Government will still be borrowing huge sums of money to pay its liabilities in the Social Security system. Moving Social Security off-budget is just another sham put forth by those who do not want to face the reality that we must stop piling debt on our children and grandchildren. 
The truth is the balanced budget amendment will protect Social Security by reducing its biggest threat--massive interest payments. If left unchecked, these payments will dramatically reduce the money available for Social Security benefits. A balanced budget amendment will keep interest payments from increasing and will allow more money to be spent on meaningful programs, including Social Security. 
Another argument put forth by opponents of a balanced budget amendment is that it will transfer power over the purse strings to the judicial branch of government. This is a serious concern, but one which is misplaced. One of the reasons why the courts will not become unduly involved in the budgetary process is the doctrine of `standing' contained in article III of the Constitution. The doctrine of standing requires that a plaintiff has a direct and specific, personal stake or injury. A `generalized' public grievance, such as a taxpayer adversely affected by macroeconomic decisions, will not be recognized. Moreover, the courts will owe deference to Congress under both the `political question' doctrine and section 6 of the amendment itself which gives Congress the enforcement authority. 
Another objection to the balanced budget amendment is that it does not provide for a capital budget. The argument here is that just as most families need to borrow money for large purchases, such as a home, the Federal Government should also have the ability to borrow money for capital investments. Those who hold that view, point out that if families had to live under the same circumstances imposed on the federal Government by a balanced budget amendment, no one would be able to purchase a home. 
Mr. President, comparing the Federal Government to the typical family purchasing a home is a very misleading comparison. The Federal Government has an annual budget of more than $1.6 trillion and the ability to increase its income at will by raising taxes. There is virtually no project conceivable which the Federal Government could not afford to finance without incurring debt. Just consider that we built the entire interstate highway system on a pay-as-you-go basis. The price of a home can easily be three times as much as the annual income of a family, which is why they need to borrow money to purchase it. By comparison, if the Federal Government wanted to undertake a project three times the amount of its annual income, the project would need to cost $4.8 trillion in 1 year. That is simply ludicrous. The truth is that with the amount of resources at the disposal of the Federal Government, there is simply no need for a separate capital budget. 
The final objection I will address is that the balanced budget amendment will hamper the Government's ability to stimulate to the economy during a recession. Mr. President, the truth is that the Federal Government does not have a very good track record when it comes to trying to stimulate our economy. Bruce Bartlett of the National Center for Policy Analysis, points out that since November of 1948, there have been seven recessions, followed by `anti-recession' legislation. In each instance, the recession the legislation was designed to end was over by the time the legislation was finally passed. In fact, Bartlett concluded that `Without exception, stimulus programs have failed to moderate the recessions at which they were aimed, and have often sowed the seeds of the next recession.' 
Part of the reason for this is that Government jobs are very expensive to create. President Carter's budget director testified before the Joint Economic Committee in 1980 that public works jobs cost between $70,000 and $198,000 per job per year. The truth is, Mr. President, Congress should not be in the business of trying to micro-manage our economy. If Congress cannot even balance its own books, why do opponents of the balanced budget amendment believe Congress can manage the entire economy? 
Mr. President, the decision before us is a simple one. It is a choice of fiscal responsibility or fiscal foolishness. It is a choice of protecting our children's financial future or destroying it. It is a choice of allowing the 50 States to have a say in this matter or denying them that freedom. In the end, Mr. President, it is a question, as Thomas Jefferson said, between right and wrong, and I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and vote for the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
Mr. President, the decision before us today is the most important one that this Senate will make in the 105th Congress. Let there be no doubt about it. Since the last balanced budget in 1969, deficit spending has become a permanent way of life in Washington. The result, as we all know, is a $5.3 trillion national debt. This debt is costing the taxpayers of America a quarter of a trillion dollars each year in interest payments alone. The reality is that without a balanced budget amendment, deficit spending will continue as usual and our children and our grandchildren will be left to pay the bill. 
Mr. President, now that the debate is over and all of the smoke has cleared, we are faced with a simple choice between fiscal responsibility or fiscal foolishness, a choice of protecting our children's financial future or destroying it, a choice of allowing 50 States to have a say in the matter or denying them that freedom.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce what I consider to be one of the most important pieces of legislation that will be offered this year. It is the Language of Government Act of 1997, which designates English as the official language of the U.S. Government. I have as original cosponsors on that legislation Senators Byrd, Coverdell, Craig, Faircloth, Gregg, Helms, Hutchinson of Arkansas, Inhofe, Lugar, Santorum, Thurmond, Cochran, and Sessions. 
Mr. President, language, as we all know, is a powerful factor in society. As de Tocqueville observed more than a hundred years ago, `The tie of language is perhaps the strongest and the most durable that can unite mankind.' That was true then, and it is true today. 
Just as surely as language has the power to unite us, it has the power to divide us. One year after French-speaking Quebec rejected by a razor-thin margin the referendum to secede from Canada, our neighbor to the north is still grappling with the repercussions of the vote. English-speaking residents of Quebec have threatened to secede if Quebec proceeds with another referendum. There are many examples in the world of what happens to nations that are divided among language and ethnic lines. Bosnia, as we all know, has been decimated by ethnic strife. The countries of the former Soviet Union are in constant internal conflict and turmoil. 
Today, more than 320 different languages are spoken in our country. We should respect each of these languages and those individuals who speak them. But in order to assimilate the various cultures and ethnic groups that comprise our great Nation, I believe we must use English. Furthermore, the Federal Government should not, in my opinion, be expected to administer its official business in all of these languages. Yet, the Federal Government continues to expand the number and types of services that it administers in foreign languages. 
Layers of bureaucracy have been added as these governmental agencies have evolved into permanent multi-language service providers. In light of this fact, Mr. President, I believe it is imperative that we establish in America a responsible, coherent language policy for all of us. 
The legislation that I offer today, on behalf of myself and the colleagues I mentioned earlier, is simple and straightforward. It designates English as the language of the Federal Government and requires that most Government functions be performed in English. There are exceptions to that rule, Mr. President, for safety, emergencies, and health-related services. 
I want to emphasize that `official English' is directed at the Federal Government and its agents, but does not cover private citizens. In no way, Mr. President, does the bill limit an individual's use of his or her native language in home, church, community, or other private communications. 
Mr. President, since last December, the Nation has engaged in a heated debate over using `ebonics' in public schools. We are all familiar with that. I do not intend to join that debate today. Instead, I raise this in order to mention a fundamental point. In the words of Maya Angelo, `The very idea * * * can be very threatening, because it can encourage young men and women not to learn standard English.' Without mastering English, our children and grandchildren cannot succeed. Indeed, as so many Americans know from their own experiences, proficiency in English propelled them from a life of poverty to a future full 
of opportunity. 
A substantial body of evidence supports that notion and confirms that there is a direct correlation between an individual's ability to speak English in America and that person's economic fortunes. 
A recent Ohio University study concluded that if immigrant knowledge of English were raised to that of native-born Americans, their income levels would increase by $63 billion annually. In 1994, the Texas Office of Immigration and Refugee Affairs published a study of Southeast Asian refugees in Texas. It conclusively demonstrated that in that population, individuals proficient in English earned over 20 times the annual income of those who could not speak English. Analysis of 1990 census data shows that immigrants' incomes rise 30 percent as a result of being able to communicate in English. 
So, without question, fluency in the English language will do more to empower people coming to America than all Federal Government services combined. The Federal Government, however, is offering more services and producing more publications in a multitude of foreign languages, at a cost of $14 billion annually. Conducting official Government functions in a foreign language supposedly facilitates assimilation into our society. What began in a piecemeal fashion to facilitate assimilation has mutated into institutionalized and permanent multilingual programs and services. 
The effect, Mr. President, is that it destroys the incentive to learn English, which undermines one of the key objectives of integration in this country. As I stated earlier, the plain truth is that immigrants who do not develop proficiency in English will almost always be relegated to a lower rung on the economic ladder, often far below their earnings potential. 
By designating English as the official language of our Government, we send a clear and unmistakable message that English is a necessary part of life in America. But it is not just a symbolic gesture. If most communication with the Federal Government is conducted in English, it encourages fluency in English. At the same time, establishing a language policy will stop the frivolous expenditure of printing Government documents in foreign languages. There is no justification for the money wasted to produce, for example, `The Reproductive Behavior of Young People in the City of Sao Paulo' in Portuguese or publication on the U.S. Mint in Chinese. The money squandered on those documents would be better spent teaching English to those who cannot speak it. My bill states that the savings from this initiative be used to teach English in America. 
Mr. President, national polling indicates that 86 percent of Americans support making English the official language of this country. In fact, Mr. President, 8 out of 10 first-generation immigrants in America support this legislation. As our Nation becomes more diverse, it becomes more and more important for Congress to deal with the establishment of an official language policy. Our consideration of this bill shows that we take our national heritage and democracy seriously.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the Tuition Tax Elimination Act, which will help make college more affordable for thousands of young people all across America. I am pleased that Senators Sessions, DeWine, Hutchinson, Faircloth, Cochran, and Smith of New Hampshire have joined me as original cosponsors. This bill will eliminate a new Federal tax on the tuition expenses of students participating in State prepaid tuition programs. Here is how the tax came about. 
It is no secret that many families in our Nation are struggling to finance their childrens' education. College tuition costs have skyrocketed in the past decade increasing 95 percent at private institutions and 82 percent at public institutions. Newsweek magazine reported last year that some families will spend more than $100,000 just to send one child to college. 
To combat the high cost of a college education, many States, including Alabama, have set up prepaid tuition funds. These funds allow parents to make a tax-free investment, years in advance of their child's enrollment in college, with the guarantee that the child's tuition will be paid for by the State when he or she enrolls in college. 
Last year, the IRS attempted to impose taxes on States operating prepaid tuition funds by claiming that the funds were not legitimate functions of the State and thus not exempt from Federal taxation. If the IRS had been successful in their attempt, many States would have been forced to terminate their prepaid tuition programs. 
Fortunately, Senators McConnell, Graham, and I were able to get a provision in the Small Business Job Protection Act which clarified that prepaid tuition programs should not be subject to Federal taxes, since they are a legitimate function of State governments. 
At the same time, the IRS was also attempting to impose a tax on the parents' contributions to these State prepaid tuition programs. What the IRS wanted to do was to count the annual increased value of the parents' contribution as income and tax it. Again, Senators McConnell, Graham, and I put a provision in the minimum wage bill last year to prevent the IRS from taking those actions. 
However, there was a provision of that bill which I did not support. It provided that when a student enrolls in college under a prepaid tuition plan, the student must pay taxes on the difference between the value of the tuition costs, which are paid by the State, and the amount his or her parent paid for the contract. Essentially, this provision is a new tax on students. I attempted to offer an amendment to strike this provision, but unfortunately, no amendments were in order. 
Mr. President, prepaid tuition programs are a creative way many States all across the country have developed to help more young people afford a college education. We need to do everything we can at the Federal level to encourage these types of programs. 
The Tuition Tax Elimination Act will do that by relieving students from Federal taxes on their tuition expenses. This legislation will provide that distributions from qualified prepaid tuition funds are not to be counted as taxable income for the student, as long as the money is spent for the designated purpose. 
This legislation is fully paid for with a provision which would suspend the automatic inflation adjustments used to award the earned income tax credit to individuals without children. President Clinton's 1993 tax bill expanded the EITC to cover individuals without children, and currently, a childless individual earning between $4,220 and $5,280 is eligible for a maximum EITC amount of $323. Each year, these income levels are adjusted upward for inflation. Many people have questioned whether we should even be providing the EITC to individuals without children. However, that is a question which can be addressed in other legislation. This offset does not eliminate the EITC for individuals without children; it simply eliminates the annual increase in the EITC calculation for individuals who have no dependents. This provision passed the Senate last year as a part of welfare reform, but it was dropped in conference. 
Mr. President, the cost of going to college is now more expensive than ever, and is growing much faster than inflation. Eliminating the tax students will face on their tuition expenses is a real step toward making college more affordable for thousands of young people all across America, and I hope my colleagues join me in support of this legislation.

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation--along with Senators Grassley, Cochran, Roberts, Abraham, and Hutchinson--which will restore to American farmers an important tool in meeting their Federal income tax obligations. 
Mr. President, America would not be what it is today without the dedication, sacrifice, and hard work of the American farmer. The American farmer is the most efficient farmer in the world. Each farmer in America provides food and fiber for 94 people in our country and an additional 35 people abroad. As a result, Americans enjoy the most affordable, healthy, and stable food supply of any country in the world. 
Yet, despite the successes of the American farmer, they are faced with unique and difficult barriers, they must overcome, including unpredictable weather, natural disasters, plauges of insects and diseases, and excessive Government regulations. All of these result in substantial income fluctuations for the average farmer. 
Wide swings in farmers' income from year to year, result in a tax burden much higher than individuals with a stable source of income because surges in income are taxed at a higher rate than is a steady flow of income. This problem is compounded when a farmers income is exaggerated by the sale of land or other assets. 
Prior to 1986, farmers were allowed to average their income over a 2-year period in order to give them some sense of regularity and predictability in their payment of Federal taxes. This provision was repealed as part of the 1986 Tax Act, which reduced the number of tax brackets and lowered the top rate of 28 percent. However, since 1986, Congress has added two new tax brackets, and increased the top rate to 39.6 percent. 
This change, along with the move to a more market-oriented farm program, makes it imperative that Congress restores to farmers the ability to average their income, and the legislation I am introducing today will do just that. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last year that this bill would cost about $90 million over 5 years. 
Representative Nick Smith has sponsored an identical bill in the House, and it has the broad support of the farming community. Groups endorsing this proposal include: Alabama Farmers Federation, American Farm Bureau Federation, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Farmers Union, National Grain Sorghum Producers, National Grange, National Pork Producers Council, and Women in Farm Economics. 
Mr. President, the success of our Nation depends in large part on the success of the American farmer. Until we can enact broad-based tax reform, we should provide farmers with some sense of regularity and predictability in meeting their Federal tax obligation. This legislation will do that, and I hope my colleagues will support it.

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. This is the same amendment which I have introduced in every Congress since the 97th Congress. Over the past 20 years, I have devoted much time and attention to promoting this idea because I believe that the single most important thing the Federal Government could do to enhance the lives of all Americans and future generations is to balance the Federal budget. 
Mr. President, Alexander Hamilton once wrote that `* * * there is a general propensity in those who govern, founded in the constitution of man, to shift off the burden from the present to a future day.* * *' 
History has proven Hamilton correct. We have seen over the past 27 years, that deficit spending has become a permanent way of life in Washington. During the past three decades, we have witnessed countless `budget summits' and `bipartisan budget deals,' and we have heard, time and again, the promises of `deficit reduction.' But despite all of these charades, the Federal budget has never been balanced, and it remains severely out of balance today. The truth is, Mr. President, it will never be balanced as long as the President and the Congress are allowed to shortchange the welfare of future generations to pay for current consumption. 
A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is the only way possible to break the cycle of deficit spending and ensure that the Government does not continue to saddle our children and grandchildren with this generation's debts. 
Mr. President, everyone in America would benefit from a balanced Federal budget. The Congressional Budget Office has stated that a balanced Federal budget would lower interest rates by up to 2 full percentage points. That would save the average American family with a $75,000 mortgage on their home, about $2,400 per year. It would save the average student with an $11,000 student loan about $1,900. That is real money put in the pockets of hard-working Americans, simply by the Government balancing its books. 
Moreover, if the Government demand for capital was reduced, that would increase the private sector's access to capital, which in turn, would generate substantial economic growth and create thousands of new jobs. 
On the other hand, without a balanced budget amendment, the Government will continue to waste the taxpayers' money on unnecessary interest payments. In fiscal year 1996, the Federal Government spent about $241 billion just to pay the interest on the national debt. That is more than double the amount spent on all education, job training, crime, and transportation programs combined. 
Mr. President, we might as well be taking these hard-earned tax dollars and pouring them down a rat hole. We could be putting this money toward improving education, developing new medical technologies, finding a cure for cancer, or even returning it to the people who earned it in the first place. But instead, about 15 percent of the Federal budget is being wasted on interest payments because advocates of big government continue to block all efforts to balance the budget. 
Mr. President, a balanced budget amendment will change all of that. It will put us on the path to begin paying off our national debt, which is currently more than $5 trillion. This amendment will help ensure that taxpayers' money will not continue to be wasted on interest payments. 
Opponents of a balanced budget amendment act like it is something extraordinary. Mr. President, a balanced budget amendment will only require the Government to do what every American already has to do: balance their checkbook. It is simply a promise to the American people that the Government will act responsibly. 
Mr. President, we do not need any more budget deals. We do not need any more `bipartisan' summits resulting in huge tax increases. What we need is a hammer to force the Congress and the President to agree on a balanced budget, not just for this year, but forever. Mr. President, a constitutional amendment to balance the budget is the only such mechanism available.
