 Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, on Friday, October 10th, I became a cosponsor of legislation introduced by Senator McCain that would reauthorize the Older Americans Act. This Act, established in 1965, established a series of programs to benefit older Americans. Services provided include nutrition, transportation, nursing home ombudsmanship, and other senior's rights programs. Needless to say, Arkansas, which has over 200,000 senior citizens, has benefitted greatly from the services provided through the Older Americans Act. In addition, the organizations in Arkansas that have received funding through the Act have done an incredible job in reaching out to our seniors. 
While the Older Americans Act expired in 1995, its programs have widespread support, which has resulted in continued funding. Nonetheless, authorization is critical for the long-term stability of these programs and for the peace of mind of senior citizens. the McCain bill renews the act, without any changes, for a period of 3 years. Let me say that, as with any reauthorization, I strongly believe in the need for congressional hearings to examine the programs contained within the act to ensure that they are working well, efficiently serving the needs of seniors, and that any appropriate adjustments in funding are made. Regrettably, the Senate Labor and Human Resource Committee, on which I serve, has not taken action on any reauthorization legislation this year. Until the committee does so, and as an indication of my very strong support for the programs contained in the Older American Act, I am cosponsoring the McCain bill. 
The Older American Act has improved the quality of life for so many of our Nation's elderly, and it will continue to provide vital services as the aging population grows. I sincerely hope that the Senate will act on legislation to reauthorize this important act soon.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor, I rise in strong support of the International Religious Freedom Act and hope for the persecuted everywhere. I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the Senate and House for their dedicated efforts in crafting this legislation. 
Mr. President, the desire for religious freedom is not uniquely American. But as Americans we are in a unique position to advocate it. As a superpower, we have the resources. As a nation of free people, we have the responsibility. Religious freedom is at the core of our country and enshrined in our Constitution. Our nation's founders fled from religious persecution in search of a land where they could freely exercise their ideal of religious freedom They stood recognizing that the suppression of their faith was tryanny over their hearts and minds. They knew that without the freedom to gather, to worship, to speak about their God, there would be no freedom. So they laid a cornerstone for our democracy, establishing freedom in law. And from that day, the protection of religious freedom has become part of our legacy, part of our identify as a nation. We must exercise this identify or one day realize that we have lost it. For the fruits of democracy, hoarded in the hands of the few, become bitter and rotten. 
Mr. President this legislation takes concrete steps to promote the basic right to religious freedom. It establishes three entities to cooperatively guarantee that combating religious persecution is a priority in U.S. foreign policy. Within the State Department, an Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Liberty will serve as a high level diplomat, raising issues of religious persecution in bilateral meetings and heading up the Office of International Religious Freedom at the State Department. A Special Advisor on Religious Persecution at the National Security Council will monitor incidents of persecution and act as an advisor and resource for the executive branch. The Commission on International Religious Liberty, a ten member, bipartisan commission, will investigate religious persecution and provide an outside voice for policy recommendations to both Congress and the White House. Under this legislation, the U.S. government collects information on religious persecution, through the compilation of an Annual Report on Religious Persecution, and responds to these violations through a broad range of options, ranging from diplomatic protest to economic sanctions. The apparatus under this legislation is not simply reactive, however. It also provides for active promotion of religious freedom through international broadcasts, Fulbright exchanges, and training for Foreign Service Officers and refugee and asylum personnel on these issues. While the apparatus may seem extensive, it only reflects the magntitude of the problem. I believe that is the least that we can do to lay a concrete foundation for religious freedom. 
Religious persecution around the world may go unnoticed in the hectic run of our daily lives, but for millions of people it is a horrifying, incessant reality. They live in fear of arrest, imprisonment, torture, and death for simply exercising their faith. In Pakistan, fear reigns under the constitution, which stipulates the death penalty for blaspheny against Mohammed. Ayoob 
Masih, a Christian, was beaten by a mob for reading his Bible, arrested, imprisoned, fined, and sentenced to death by hanging for blasphemy. Local police have failed to control angry mobs destroying the homes and churches of Christians in Pakistan. Ahmadis, Hindus, Zakris, and other minority religious groups have also been targets of lynching. In Egypt, Coptic Christians are routinely denied permits to build or repair churches. In Cairo's Tora district, security forces forcibly closed the doors of the Church of St. Bishoi, waxing its windows and preventing any further entry and any freedom to worship there. An eighteen year old girl in Laos was thrown into prison by government forces for teaching Bible classes to neighborhood children. In Iran, a man was shot in the street for not being in the mosque during prayer time. Bahai's have also been subject to a rash of executions. In Sudan, where civil war has ravaged the land and claimed over a million lives, Christians and Animists are subject to abduction, imprisonment, torture, enslavement, forced conversion to Islam, and execution. Christian children are abducted, forced into reeducation camps, given Arab names, and raised as Muslims. A Muslim sheik who Christianity was arrested, charged with apostasy, and faced with execution unless he returned to Islam within two months. Only government-certified clergymen are allowed to talk about religion in Uzbekistan. Private religious instruction is also formally banned under pains of stiff fines and labor camp sentences. 
This type of insidious government control is also present in China, where Article 36 of the Chinese Constitution guarantees religious freedom, but religious repression is carefully meted out through an apparatus of government registration, intense scrutiny, unrelenting intimidation, and brutal punishment. Only five religions are permitted and control is exercised over these official churches in matters such as personnel selection, sermon themes, congregation size, and dissemination of religious materials. Unofficial, or illegal, religious gatherings are forcibly broken up, its participants arrested, victims of extortion, torture, and even fatal beatings. Zheng Muzheng, who was active in sharing his faith, was beaten to death in a jail in Hunan Province. His grieving widow has been repeatedly interrogated and held without arrest. Members of unofficial churches fortunate enough not to be imprisoned live under the glare of government surveillance. They are arbitrarily and repeatedly detained without formal charges, threatened with loss of property and employment, subject to heavy fines--all for believing in and worshiping an authority higher than the Communist Party. Under their reign of terror, Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and temples cannot be constructed and are often destroyed. Monks and nuns are restricted in numbers and tortured. Palden Gyatso, a Tibetan Buddhist monk, testified before the House International Relations Committee about the routine use by the Chinese government of electric shock guns, serrated and hooked knives, handcuffs and thumbcuffs on those who would dare to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed freedom of religion. 
The grim and disturbing reality is that religious persecution is not limited to a particular region or a particular faith. It beats on the backs of Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Baha'is. It scourages over half the world's population in over seventy countries. 
Mr. President, this legislation takes comprehensive action against this alarming trend of oppression. Through its reporting provisions, it sheds light on the dark practices of persecution-- 
a radiant ray of hope for those languishing in prisons. By requiring the President to use those means deemed necessary to not allow these atrocious acts to persist, this legislation cracks the heavy yoke of persecution. In its active promotion of religious freedom, it sweeps open the gates of suppressed faith, preparing the way for the liberty. 
Mr. President, I am aware that detractors of this legislation claim that it establishes a false hierarchy of human rights abuses. But I suspect that for those same critics, treating all human rights abuses on an equal basis means voting against all human rights provisions on an equal basis. Others claim that it binds the hands of the President, propelling him on a course of self-defeating foreign policy, forcing him to ultimately `fudge' sanctions. This well-crafted legislation has taken this concern into consideration, incorporating the views of its sponsors, the Administration, and the business community. It focuses on specific and particularly egregious instances of religious persecution. While it requires the President to act, it also presents the President with a wide berth of options and requires a review of the potential impact on American security and economic interests and its intended efficacy. 
Still others claim that we should not be moralizing or imposing our values on other countries. Those suffering in prison for practicing their faith would certainly disagree. Freedom of religion is a universal right and aspiration, recognized and articulated in a number of international instruments including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that `Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion . . . to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance.' The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes that `Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching.' By advocating this freedom, we are not imposing our values on others but reaffirming a universal right. 
We must not cower under the covers of complacency. We must not be complicit actors, carried away in a current of oppression. We must not, for fear of taking a false step on the path of justice, refuse to walk at all. We must be the voice of those muted by their oppressors, crying out for a land of the free. We must, in the words of Ronald Reagan, `. . . be staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky few, but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings.'

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my retiring colleague from Arkansas, Senator Dale Bumpers. Arkansas is a State with a small population, and it is a State where politicians of even opposing political parties and philosophies find their lives and careers intersecting and intertwining. 
As a high school student, I followed Dale Bumpers' meteoric rise from an unknown country lawyer from Charleston, AR, to the Governor of the State and a man who became known in Arkansas politics as the giant killer, defeating such luminaries of Arkansas politics as Win Rockefeller and J.W. Fulbright. 
I worked for Dale's opponent in 1980, not because I was enamored by his opponent, but because I was upset with some of Dale's votes. That has always been the way with Dale Bumpers; you either agreed with him passionately or you disagreed vehemently. 
While Dale has always been as smooth as honey, he has never tried to varnish his views or dilute his positions to make them more palatable to the general public, whether it was the Panama Canal or the space station. 
Mr. President, I mentioned that in Arkansas, political lives and careers intersect frequently. In 1986, my brother Asa, then a U.S. attorney and now serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, ran against Senator Bumpers in his second reelection campaign. 
I worked in Asa's campaign, and I encountered and experienced firsthand the high esteem in which the people of Arkansas hold Dale Bumpers. After Senator Bumpers won that race resoundingly, delivering a good old country thumping to the Hutchinsons, I returned to my service in the Arkansas legislature and Asa became the State GOP chairman. We continued to follow Senator Bumpers' career from afar, occasionally bumping into him at events in the State. 
In 1990, Asa ran for attorney general of Arkansas. It was a politically tough, mean, even nasty race. It was hard fought and a very close race. I remember one day as I was working in Asa's headquarters in Little Rock, Dale Bumpers walked in off the street unannounced. He came by, he said, to wish us well and to say that he always respected us and thought well of us. I saw a side of Dale Bumpers that those who know him well see all the time. He knows well that there is life beyond the political arena and that politicians are, first and foremost, human beings. 
I saw this again in 1996 when I was running for the U.S. Senate. It was the closing days of a very close race. Dale and my predecessor, Senator David Pryor, were campaigning for my opponent in a fly-around of the State. I suppose Dale was returning the favor from a decade before when I was campaigning for his opponent. 
In the closing days, my son Timothy was involved in a tragic and terrible automobile accident. Timothy was seriously injured, and I was in the hospital room, not sure whether he was going to make it or not. The phone rang, and it was Dale Bumpers. He called to assure me of his thoughts and his prayers and to tell me that he and David were suspending campaigning until it was clear that my son was going to be OK. 
Dale, we will miss you around this place. I won't miss your votes, but I will miss you. I will miss your stories, and I will miss your humor. I will miss your eloquence, and I will miss your passion. I am grateful that our Senate careers overlapped for these 2 years. Thanks for your advice and counsel, and best wishes on this next phase of your life. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, this amendment amends the McCain first-degree underlying amendment to allow the commission to establish by the Internet Tax Freedom Act a study of the effects of taxation on interstate sales, or the lack thereof on retail businesses and State and local governments. 
I can think of nothing more reasonable and nothing more common sense than saying that the commission that we are creating should conduct a study to look at and examine the implications upon retail businesses and the implications upon local and State governments that this moratorium and this bill would have. 
The Senate rejected an amendment last week which would have immediately authorized States to require out-of-State sellers to collect sales taxes and remit them to the State in which the purchase was made. My colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, offered that amendment. I think that many of my colleagues who joined me in voting against this amendment would agree that this issue warrants further study. 
Why not have the commission establish by this bill conduct a study and examine the issue that is so important to State and local governments and which is so important to local businesses that are trying to survive and who are remitting those sales taxes. This issue, which is so critical, ought to be, I believe, examined and studied. For the sake of small mom-and-pop businesses who find themselves in competition with Internet entities and other out-of-State sellers who do not have to collect State sales taxes from out-of-State buyers, we should allow the commission to study the impact that the lack of taxation on these transactions has on small businesses. 
For the sake of out-of-State sellers who do collect and remit sales taxes while their competitors do not, let's allow the commission to study this issue. This is, in fact, a commission study. 
It should be noted that Congress and Congress alone can either accept or eject the recommendations that the commission might make. The Supreme Court decided in the case of Quill v. North Dakota that States cannot require out-of-State sellers to collect and remit sales taxes on goods purchased for use in a particular State, unless Congress authorizes them to do so. 
My amendment does not overturn Quill. I want to emphasize that. This amendment does not overturn the Quill decision. It simply allows the commission to study the implications, to study the ramifications of Quill on small businesses and State and local governments. 
Electronic commerce is estimated to reach $8 billion in 1998. And by the year 2002, electronic commerce is expected to reach $300 billion. 
Let me say that the Internet is an incredible tool both for education purposes and business promotion. My amendment in no way is intended to thwart the growth of the Internet. Again, it merely says that in light of the incredible growth in electronic commerce that we have witnessed over the last 5 years and that we anticipate in the next 5 years that this commission that we are about to create should have the right to examine its impact on businesses serving local markets. 
We will have an argument that my good friend from Arizona has argued--that this Internet Tax Freedom Act should focus solely on the Internet. But I argue that the Internet is a form of interstate commerce just like mail order, just like catalog sales. And when we talk about the impact of such interstate sales on local businesses, there is no distinction between the three. We should not address this issue in a vacuum. 
So the commission that is created ought to have the right to examine all of the implications of what we are doing and its impact upon that small businessman, that small businesswoman, that city, that county, that State government, and the effect upon their revenue stream. 
So the amendment I propose is a compromise. It is, I believe, one that is worthy of support. 
I ask my colleagues to support this second-degree amendment.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
In the early part of your remarks, you emphasized and read from the bill that the commission would be authorized to conduct a thorough study. You emphasized the word `thorough.' I think you found a couple places where the term is used. It seems you are implying they will look at all issues affected by this legislation and by Internet sales. 
My question is, why, if in fact it is to be a thorough study looking at all issues and all the implications and ramifications of Internet sales on retailers and on government, why then would the Gregg amendment exclude, in effect, say this is off the table, this is one area of issues you cannot look at? When the Finance Committee, by a vote of 19-1, said this should be included, this should be an area that should be examined, this should be the purview of the commission, why then, if it is to be a thorough study, would this amendment, the Gregg amendment, exclude this particular area from study?

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair. I just want to make a few closing observations of my perspective on this second-degree amendment and clarify a few things that I think are not representative at all of what this second-degree amendment does. 
May I just say also, being the Senator from the State of Arkansas and being from the hometown in which Wal-Mart stores are nationally headquartered, world wide headquartered, and Wal-Mart has been disparagingly mentioned several times----

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Not at this time. In my office in the Dirksen Building I have a hanging portrait of the 5-&-10-cent store where Sam Walton started the Wal-Mart stores. There is nothing in this amendment that is antientrepreneur. The fact is that Wal-Mart, with their huge advertising budget, as it was alluded to, started as a little 5-&-10-cent store, as a mom-and-pop store in Arkansas. That is an American success story which ought to be applauded, not disparaged. Every American ought to have that opportunity, to have that dream. We ought not with legislation undercut that little Main Street store that cannot be replicated, cannot be replaced. No matter how great the Internet is, no matter how great catalogs are, they cannot replace that store on Main Street giving to the little league and supporting the local efforts and local initiatives. 
A couple other things. It has been implied that somehow this amendment, this second-degree amendment would mandate that they focus the study, the commission focus their study on interstate sales. Nothing could be further from the truth. If you look at the bill, it says, and I quote, `may include in the study *under subsection,' may include a study of. It is, in fact, the Gregg amendment, the McCain-Gregg amendment that excludes even their authorization to study the impact, the obvious impact of remote sales including catalog, including Internet, all of the Internet remote sales, its impact upon small businesses and upon local and State government. 
It simply says `may.' It is simply authorizing, permissive language. It is, in fact, the House bill that mandated that they study this area and its impact, because it is so obvious the impact that it could potentially have, and that any study that should be done, if it is in fact to be a thorough study, must include this area. 
It is the proponents of the Gregg amendment who would say what the Finance Committee did by a vote of 19 to 1 should be overturned. The Finance Committee, led by Senator Roth, included a study of these issues--and they should be included. They should be studied. The language in the bill says `thorough study.' How can you have a thorough study and then delete the area of interstate sales? It puzzles me. How can anyone object to having a broader study that would include all of the various issues involved in a very complex subject? 
It has been implied that somehow this second-degree amendment, which would say this issue ought to be studied, is protax. My goodness, anybody who has ever looked at Tim Hutchinson's record in the statehouse in Arkansas, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate, would have a hard time believing this amendment I am offering is protax or somehow a roadmap to higher taxes. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are not prejudging any kind of conclusions or any kind of recommendations that this commission might make. And, I remind my colleagues, it requires a two-thirds vote of the members of the commission to make any recommendation, and that is all they can make, is a recommendation. The final say remains with the Congress. 
How in the world can you say this somehow is going to lead to higher taxes or somehow thwart the growth of the Internet? And that, may I say, has been another mischaracterization of this amendment--that it is somehow not only protax but anti-Internet. 
We have applauded, and I applaud, the growth of the Internet. I quoted the statistics, from $8 billion in 1998 to the estimated $300 billion in sales in the year 2002; that is a good thing. But while it is a good thing, we should not be so blind as to think it is not going to have serious consequences, serious impacts, that ought to be examined in advance. 
I support the bill. I support the timeout. I support the pause. I support the moratorium. But I also believe, if we are going to have a study, it ought to truly be a thorough study. It ought not say look at everything but don't look at the impact upon business, don't look at the impact upon the city government or the State government. It ought to truly be a thorough study. You cannot deal with these issues in a vacuum. They are interrelated, all of these, and they need to be, in fact, thoroughly studied. 
Let me just conclude by saying I thought Senator Enzi's comments were moving. I, like Senator Dorgan, did not realize that he and his wife operated a little Main Street shoestore for over 20 years in Gillette, WY. I did not know that. I had a great appreciation for Senator Enzi. I have a greater appreciation now. But I think also that, as he paid those sales taxes day in and day out, as he made the struggles that any small business person makes in order to stay in existence, as he contributed to the Little League, as he contributed to the United Way, as he did everything that only a physical entity actually being right there in the community can do--irreplaceable--that we need to consider them, we need to think about them, as we pass this needed legislation. 
I believe if they will simply look at the language of the second-degree amendment restoring what the Finance Committee did by a 19-to-1 vote and saying this is an area that ought to be examined, ought to be looked at, then I think my colleagues will realize that in fact it does make good sense and they will support it. I ask for their support. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of tax relief for the American people and in support of the House-passed legislation that will provide taxpayer relief today. 
Tax collections, it is estimated, will exceed over $8 trillion in the next 5 years. An $80 billion tax cut--that is what the House of Representatives cut--an $80 billion tax cut amounts to about one penny savings on every dollar paid in to the Federal Government. I don't believe that is too much out of this surplus that we are realizing because of a robust economy and because of restraints on spending, as much waste as therestill is. We have slowed the growth of Federal spending and, as a result of that, for the first time in 29 years, we have a balanced budget, we have a surplus, and it is only right and it is only proper that a portion of that be returned to the American people. 
I think the only problem with the House-passed tax cut is that it is too little, but we should at least bring it forward, and we should at least have that debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
Under the Clinton administration, taxes have risen to the highest level in peacetime history. If Ben Franklin was right, that the only thing that is certain is death and taxes, this administration has made it equally true that nothing is as certain as spending and overtaxation. We have the highest tax rate in peacetime history. Taxes are at a historic high at a level of 21 percent of the gross domestic product. 
According to data from the OMB, total Federal receipts will amount to 19.9 percent of the GDP in 1998 and 20.1 percent of the GDP in 1999. That tells me one thing. That tells me that even under a Republican-controlled House and Senate, Government continues to grow and Government revenues continue to grow as well. 
In my home State of Arkansas, this amount of taxation translates into $7,352 in taxes per capita in 1998. That is an onerous burden to put on a low-income State. It is a heavy burden to place upon people anywhere. 
In Connecticut, the tax burden is $15,525 per capita. 
The typical American family sees 38 percent of its income going to pay for taxes, as opposed to 28 percent for food, for clothing, for housing and only 3.6 percent going to savings--38 percent for taxes--Federal, State and local level--28 percent for food, clothing and housing. 
Mr. President, it is time to stop picking the pockets of American taxpayers, and it is time to put money back in their pockets and untie their hands. The Taxpayer Relief Act does just that by giving the American people a tax cut of $80.1 billion. 
Couples today who want to be responsibly married, to share their lives together, have a slap in the face immediately from the Federal Government. Twenty-one million couples pay an average of $1,400 extra in taxes for pursuing the right course of marriage. 
The Taxpayer Relief Act takes away this stinging insult by allowing married couples who file jointly to claim a standard deduction twice the amount of the standard deduction for a single taxpayer. It also increases the basic standard deduction for married taxpayers who file separately to equal the basic standard deduction for singles. Even as they try to raise a family with limited resources and increasing costs, parents strain under this very heavy burden of taxation. 
The House-passed bill protects important tax credits, including credits for children, the $500-per-child tax credit, new credits for adoption and education, and reduces the alternative minimum tax as well. 
All of these are important steps. They are, I believe, the right course for this Congress to take. I regret the President's commitment to veto any tax-cut legislation this year. 
American farmers and ranchers have had to face a terribly hard time with unpredictable and damaging weather trends that have destroyed their harvest and livelihood, only to face income erosion from unpredictable and damaging tax regulations as well. The House-passed bill would provide greater stability amidst this turmoil by income averaging, currently set to expire in the year 2000, and it would make that permanent. Farmers and ranchers would be able to benefit from the 100 percent health insurance deductibility. All of these things would provide relief for the agricultural community. 
Men and women attempting to manage their money wisely find the Government chipping away at their savings, through taxation on interest and dividends, and the Taxpayer Relief Act will exclude the first $200 in interest and dividends that they receive. We say we want the American people to save and invest, and yet we penalize them with our Tax Code. Some say the $200 exclusion is not very much. That exclusion will eliminate all taxation on interest and dividends for 32 million people in this country. 
When taxpayers become senior citizens, their Social Security earnings limit will be increased under this legislation, between full retirement age and age 70, from $17,000 in fiscal year 1999 to almost $40,000 in fiscal year 2008. 
These are important provisions, certainly not the least of which is the accelerated relief that will be provided from the death tax, a heinous provision in our Tax Code that says if you work hard enough, save enough, invest well enough, Uncle Sam is going to reach into your grave, reach into your pocket and take 55 percent of what you own. The American dream is to work hard enough, invest enough, and pass them on to your children and give them a little better start than you had. 
The death tax is just the opposite. It is one of the most anti-American dream provisions in the Tax Code. The bill passed from the House would accelerate raising that exclusion to 41 million. It would be a small step in providing relief from the death tax. 
There are those who say we can't cut taxes this year; we have to give it all to Social Security. It is interesting to me that those who argue that have yet to come forward with a save Social Security plan. They have yet to come forward with a Social Security reform plan, but they have advocated billions of dollars in new spending. 
Mr. President, I wish I had much longer to elaborate on this, but I quote the President when on May 26 of this year, he said:  
We can use these good times to honor those who've put in a lifetime of work and prepare for the future retirement of the baby boomers by saving the Social Security system for generations to come. Or we can give in to the temptation in this election year to squander our surpluses the moment they start coming in. 
Do you get the picture? If you take the surplus and spend it on new spending programs, that is good, but if you return it to the American people in the form of tax relief, that is squandering. The very President who made that statement has advocated billions of dollars in additional spending--$5.8 billion already spent--and a request in supplemental funds for $14.148 billion, including almost $2 billion for Bosnia. That is coming out of this sacrosanct untouchable surplus. 
The Taxpayer Relief Act just says let's return $7 billion of that surplus in the first year, 1999, to the American people. I believe that is what we should do. Instead of enacting $150 billion in new spending programs, we should return one penny on the dollar, which is what the Taxpayer Relief Act does, out of what they are paying into the Government back to them in the form of tax relief. 
The debate hasn't changed: higher taxes and more Government; lower taxes and less Government. We were given that mandate by the American people, and we should enjoin that debate by passing the Taxpayer Relief Act this year, sending it to the President and letting him decide whether or not he will give the American people the relief they so much deserve. 
I thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the fiscal year 1999 Strom Thurmond defense authorization conference report. I congratulate the managers of this bill for their exemplary work. In particular, I would like to express my most sincere gratitude and appreciation to Chairman Thurmond for his service to the Senate and for his service to our country. 
Mr. President, I know that this was one of the most contentious conferences in the past decade, particularly because of the U.S. satellite licensing provisions. However, I am pleased that this conference report contains a provision shifting the jurisdiction for U.S. satellite licensing from the Commerce Department back to the State Department, where I believe the national security of this country can best be protected. This action is a step away from the controversial policy that President Clinton established in 1996 and it is a step toward enhanced national security. I hope the President, in signing this bill, will walk forward with us. 
In addition, I am very pleased by the addition of several China-related provisions that I spoke in behalf of--sponsored some of those--that I believe will limit the role of the oppressive Chinese regime and United States complicity in their actions. 
In particular, this conference report includes a provision requiring the Departments of Defense and Justice, FBI, and the CIA to compile a list of known PLA commercial fronts operating in the United States. This provision also authorizes the President to monitor, to restrict, and to seize, if necessary, the assets of, and ban the operation of, such PLA companies within these United States. 
Furthermore, the Senate adopted and included in the conference report a provision authorizing funding for additional customs agents to enforce the existing ban on slave labor products, an ongoing problem. These products are produced in slave-labor conditions in China and are sold to American consumers, unbeknownst to the consumer. These sections call upon the President to strengthen international agreements to improve monitoring of slave-labor imports. 
There is yet a further provision that I am heartened the conference has included regarding Radio Free Asia. This provision would fund 24-hour-a-day Radio Free Asia broadcasts throughout China in each of the major dialects. This provision will allow the Voice of Freedom to penetrate through the oppressive veil now muting the Chinese people. 
I want to make one final observation. Last week, in declaring the success of his country in combating the floods raging throughout China, President Jiang Zemin compared that success to the success of stemming the tide of democracy and praising their crackdown at Tiananmen Square. I think I need say little more, Mr. President, as to the ongoing problems of an oppressive regime in China. I applaud the chairman and the conference for including these very important provisions in the conference report. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you. 
I thank the chairman for the outstanding work he has done on this bill. I will support the legislation. I think it is a commitment to our Nation's defense. The Senator from Alaska always does a good job on all the appropriations bills, but particularly this defense appropriations bill. 
I am glad for several projects that I think are critical to our Nation's defense but are also critical to the State of Arkansas, including the MLRS system, manufactured in Camden, AR, Fort Chaffee in Ft. Smith, AR, the Pine Bluff Arsenal, and C-130s in Jacksonville. 
I will vote for the bill. I do so with a deep reservation. I am puzzled, discouraged and disheartened by the exclusion of an amendment that passed unanimously in the Senate by a vote of 99-0 --it passed the House of Representatives on separate votes of 415-1 and 366-54--which would have condemned China's policy of forced abortions and religious persecution and would have denied visas to the perpetrators. 
I am just puzzled, and I am discouraged that an amendment that had such bipartisan support, that has no cost and no controversy, would have been dropped in conference. 
Yesterday, President Jiang Zemin in China, according to the Washington Post today, issued a strident defense of the Tiananmen massacre in which hundreds--thousands of students were slain. At the very time that the President of China is defending that horrendous action, this body cannot lift even a timid voice in condemnation of it--even a mild rebuke of those abuses. I am appalled and I find it inexplicable that we remain silent and that the conference would have determined to drop this amendment that had such support in both bodies. 
So while I vote for this conference report, I do so with a deep reservation and with the caveat that this Senator will use his breath, so long as he has the opportunity in the Senate, to continue to raise the issues of human rights abuses in China and to offer these kinds of amendments. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the ban on the partial-birth abortion procedure and in support of the vote to override the President's veto. It is inexplicable to me why that veto occurred, and I think it is unfortunate and tragic. We have an opportunity tomorrow to right that wrong. I join my distinguished colleagues in praising Senator Santorum, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, who has so eloquently put forth the case for banning this procedure and appealing to our consciences as Americans, as human beings, and as civilized people to end the condoning of this procedure in this country. 
I think, as I listened to the Senator from Pennsylvania this afternoon, and as I recall the previous debates on this issue, I was moved, as I know millions of Americans were moved, as we listened to not only the logic but the moral persuasiveness of the need to ban this procedure. I think this evening, as I say those laudatory words about my colleague from Pennsylvania, it is appropriate that we say also that there are many in the other Chamber, the House of Representatives, who have fought this battle over and over to ensure that that veto was overridden in the House of Representatives. 
I think of my friend from Florida, Charles Canady, who is the chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee in the House of Representatives, who has so eloquently and so forcefully argued for this legislation and carried this crusade across this country. 
I think of the distinguished chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who has come under such unfair and scathing attack in recent days and yet who has been, I think, the most eloquent and passionate voice for the unborn that modern America has seen. 
I rise in defense of him and in support of Congressman Hyde this evening and appreciation for all that he has done for the cause of the unborn. On more than one occasion, as I served in the House of Representatives, I saw minds change and hearts change under the persuasiveness of his oratory. 
It is my hope that even as we look at this very important vote in the morning, that, yes, there will be those in this body who will look deep within their soul, who evaluate their own conscience, and examine their own hearts, and that we might even yet see those two or three votes necessary to change in order to see this veto overridden. 
It is often suggested in this debate that government should stay out of the abortion issue. But if the protection of innocent lives is not government's duty, then I ask, What is government's duty? Thomas Jefferson once wrote, `The care of human life--not its destruction, is the first and only legitimate objective of good government. Legislative efforts to protect the weak and defenseless are right and should be pursued.' I can think of none who are weaker, I can think of none in the human family more defenseless, than those who are but inches from enjoying life. 
In fact, in March of last year, my home State of Arkansas joined a number of other States in banning such a procedure when the State legislature passed and the government signed our partial-birth abortion ban in the State of Arkansas. 
This procedure is a barbaric, uncivilized procedure, shockingly close to infanticide, as has been so frequently observed on the floor of the Senate today. It is so close to infanticide that, in fact, no civilized country, no compassionate people, should allow it. Any woman knows that the first step of partial-birth abortion--breach delivery--is something to avoid, not something to intentionally cause. 
During the last debate that we had on this subject, I quoted Jean Wright, associate professor of pediatrics and anesthesia at Emory University. It is a quote that I think deserves being said again during this debate. She was testifying against the argument that fetuses who are candidates for partial-birth abortion do not feel pain during the procedure. She testified that the fetus is sensitive to pain, perhaps even more sensitive--more sensitive--than a full-term infant. She added, and this is the part that is especially striking, and I quote her words as she testified: `This procedure, if it was done on an animal in my institution, would not make it through the institutional review process.' And then she said, `The animal would be more protected than this child is.' 
How tragic that we allow that situation to exist where, in an institution of higher learning in this country, animals have greater protections than do unborn children. 
So I am glad this evening very briefly to rise in support of the Senator from Pennsylvania, to rise in support of this override of the President's veto. As has been said, this is not about choice nor compulsion, it is about inhumane disposal of unwanted babies. 
This legislation does not prevent a woman from receiving medical care or reproductive care. It does not overturn Roe v. Wade. It simply ends an unnatural and unhealthy practice that results in the loss of human life. We must help the helpless, we must defend the defenseless, and we must give voice to the voiceless. 
I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania and my colleague from Ohio, who will speak soon, for giving voice to the voiceless, for standing up and defending the defenseless, and for helping the most helpless and most innocent in our society, the unborn. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill, with Senator Bumpers being recognized to offer an amendment related to mining. 
The Senate will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 to allow the weekly party conferences to meet. Following the conferences there will be 10 minutes for closing remarks in relation to the Bumpers amendment. At the expiration of that time, approximately 2:25 p.m., the Senate will proceed to a vote on or in relation to the amendment. 
Following that vote, the Senate will continue consideration of the Interior bill. Members are encouraged to offer and debate amendments during Tuesday afternoon's session so the Senate can make good progress on the Interior bill. The Senate may also consider any other legislative or executive items cleared for action. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I think we have before us a bill that is very important and well worth the time that we have taken debating it on the floor of the Senate today. This bill deals with the unconscionable practice of some labor unions today to send paid salts or unpaid salts into a business under the guise of working for that employer but when the real intent is to wreak economic damage and ultimately bring a business and employer to his or her knees. 
Salting is the calculated practice of placing trained union agents in a nonunion workplace whose primary purpose is to harass, disrupt company operations, apply economic pressure, increase operating and legal costs, and ultimately put the company out of business. 
Mr. President, the Truth in Employment Act simply inserts a provision in the NLRA freeing an employer from the requirement of employing `. . . any person who is not a bona fide employee applicant, in that such person seeks or has sought employment with the employer with the primary purpose of furthering another employment or agency status.' In other words, an employer is not required to hire an employee whose primary--primary purpose--I emphasize, whose primary purpose in applying for a job is not to work and benefit the company. 
Participation in union activities or an in-house employee organizing committee would not constitute employment or agency status. It simply allows employers to not hire overt salts and to give employers recourse against covert salts--those who would come in surreptitiously. 
The bill also specifically protects the rights of bona fide employees to self-organization, labor organization membership, and collective bargaining. 
Let me just take a moment to emphasize what this bill will not do, because it has been so grossly mischaracterized by those who want to see this practice continue in the American workplace. 
No. 1, it does not undermine legitimate rights or protections. Employers will gain no ability to discriminate against union membership and activities or activities, or activities in other organizations. It only seeks to stop the destructive practice of salting; that is all. 
No. 2, it does not prevent union organizing or other types of organizing, such as women advocacy groups or a day-care program in the workplace. It does not prevent women and minorities from advocating their rights. It does not change the definition of `an employee' and what an employee is. 
It does not overturn the decisions of the Supreme Court. It does not overturn the decision of Town & Country Electric, Inc., which stated that paid union organizers can fall within the literal, statutory definition of `employees.' 
It does not create a system of blacklists. And it does not promote mind reading or mind control, as some of my colleagues would suggest. 
Salting is not a product of my imagination, it is a very great reality in the workplace today. 
Jack Allen, previously of Thomasville, GA, provided an account of his experiences to Representative Allen Boyd of Florida, where he currently is employed. Allen Electric was founded by his father in 1947. He eventually took over the company. 
Mr. Allen's family-owned business, passed down from his father, eventually sank under the heavy financial weight of legal expenses--expenses incurred because he tried to defend himself against fraudulent discrimination charges by union salts. 
Mr. President, this legislation will prevent others from suffering the injuries that Mr. Allen suffered--the loss of his family company, the loss of all his hard work, the loss of his reputation. 
I think it is wrong for us, under current law, to compel 
employers to hire someone who comes into the workplace with the goal of disrupting, destroying, and eventually bankrupting their employer. That is wrong. This is a modest piece of legislation that takes a small step in restoring balance and fairness in employee-employer relations. I ask my colleagues to support this motion to invoke cloture. 
I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

As often as somebody wants to get up and yell and scream and have a tirade about this being disruptive of workers' and union members' rights and the rights to organize, if you simply read the bill, it says unambiguously and very forthrightly that there is nothing in this bill that will interfere with `. . . a bona fide employee applicant, including the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representation of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.'

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, we likewise have scores of letters that have been submitted for the Record--small companies that are being destroyed by the terrible practice of salts. We have literally tens of thousands of names that have come in on petitions saying please pass something to protect small employers. 
The Senator from Massachusetts has questioned the logic. Why would somebody go in to destroy a company? Why not organize the company? That is the whole point. These are companies that have not been willing to organize, or they could not get the support among the employees of that company to organize. So in desperation they go in not to organize, not to legitimately persuade employees to join a union and to collectively bargain, but to economically ruin and devastate the viability of a small company. Why are we compelling employers to hire people who do not want to work but want to destroy their company? 
Imagine that salt who comes home at the end of the day, hired by the labor union to go in and economically destroy by filing frivolous complaints, to file OSHA complaints, or cause OSHA complaints, at the end of the day facing their wife who says, `Honey, how did your day go?' `My day went great. I went out and helped to destroy the livelihood of my employer'--the American dream of what he has worked for for a lifetime. Imagine the employer going home at the end of the day, a small businessman, and his spouse says, `How did your day go?' `Oh, great. I spent my day in court trying to defend myself against frivolous complaints that have been filed.' 
It is not good for the employee or the employer. Many salts have come out of it and have said, `I will not be involved in that kind of practice any more.' 
I ask my colleagues this simple question, because I think it is simply an issue of common sense. Would you hire someone in your office, would you hire someone for your staff, who came in with the conscious, primary purpose of undermining everything you are working for--every legislative goal, every legislative agenda, every project in your State--and they are coming in for the purpose of undermining your role as a U.S. Senator? Would you hire that person? I think the obvious, commonsense answer--and the answer that we employ every day when we interview applicants--is no, we wouldn't do that. And yet, we are compelling small businessmen and women across this country to hire those who, they know in their heart when they come in, are going to disrupt the workplace and undermine the economic viability of the business and ultimately destroy them. 
This legislation is modest. It is appropriate. I ask my colleagues to invoke cloture so that we can pass this bill for the benefit of small business men and women across this country.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the S. 1981 legislation. This legislation will enable thousands of businesses in Arkansas and across the Nation to avoid the insidious and unscrupulous practice known as salting which is literally crippling thousands of small businesses across this country. 
The Truth in Employment Act inserts a provision in the National Labor Relations Act establishing that an employer is not required to hire a person seeking employment for the primary purpose of furthering the objectives of an organization other than that of the employer. This measure is not intended to undermine the legitimate rights or protections currently in law for workers in this country enabling them to organize. Employers will gain no ability to discriminate against union membership or activities. This bill only seeks to stop the destructive practice of salting. In fact, I will just read the last provision in the bill itself, which guarantees the protections for workers to organize, because the argument will be made, opponents of this legislation will say, that this is somehow trying to undermine the right of workers to organize. 
So this provision says: 
Nothing in the bill shall affect the rights and responsibilities under this Act of any employee who is or was a bona fide employee applicant, including the right to self-organization, to form, join or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid protection. 
So this bill is clearly not designed to harm workers or to undermine their ability to organize. That provision passed the House of Representatives unanimously, incidentally. I believe it has broad support in the Senate as well. But there is a practice that is becoming all too common across this country, that is both immoral and insidious and is not a legitimate organizing tactic, and it needs to be outlawed. The bill does not change the definition of `employee.' It does not overturn the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue that I think is of common sense and fairness. Would any person intentionally bring wanton destruction upon his or her own home? Would a homeowner spend hard-earned money for a colony of termites and let them loose in his or her house, leaving them free to gnaw away at the equity he or she had spent years building up in a home or property? Certainly no one would commit such an irrational attack of self-destruction. No one would willfully and deliberately bring thousands of dollars of damage on himself. Instead, the homeowner would take every precaution to preserve the structure of his home, keeping out ruinous influences. Yet, today, in a similar situation, small business owners nationwide are prevented from defending their own companies from pernicious attacks known as salting. 
What is salting? Paid and unpaid union agents infiltrate nonunion businesses under the pretense--the pretense of seeking employment. And then, at that point, employers are caught in a dilemma, facing charges if they refuse union labor and facing charges if they hire these salts. So if they don't hire, unfair labor practices are filed, discrimination claims are filed against the employer. If they do hire them, they then face, in effect, termites in their own business, eating away at the solvency of their own enterprise. Once on the job, these salts set about sabotaging the company through workplace disruptions and a battery of frivolous charges to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, or by creating OSHA violations 
and then reporting those violations to OSHA. 
Employers who try to fire them face yet another litany of false charges. Defending against these charges costs money in legal fees, costs time in lost productivity and costs a company's reputation through negative publicity. Yet, to add insult to injury, employers are often forced to pay large damage awards or settlements because they cannot afford the high legal fees needed for justice to be served. 
Employers have little or no defense against these relentless--relentless--assaults. Instead, they are forced to invite destruction into their companies and can only stand by, it seems, helplessly as years of hard work and investment are devoured before their eyes. 
In my home State of Arkansas, George Smith, the president of Little Rock Electrical Contractors, has been the victim of salting campaigns. Let me just tell you his story. 
It is a family-owned business and a merit shop contractor, hiring both union and nonunion labor. Mr. Smith never expected to face charges of unfair labor practices from people he didn't even hire. 
At a company site in Louisiana, two men drove up to Little Rock and asked if the company was taking applications. They were told no, and they drove off. Five months later, Mr. Smith was notified that charges of discrimination had been filed against him by the NLRB. He subsequently hired a labor attorney who assured him that he could win, as the charges had no merit whatsoever, that justice would be served. 
Unfortunately, the cost of the 2-day hearing would be $15,000 in order to have justice served. And since the unions would appeal if Mr. Smith won, additional costs of up to $8,000 could be almost guaranteed. 
On the other hand, the cost of settlement with these two nonemployees who had filed the claim was $3,000 for each man. So, in the end, Mr. Smith chose the less expensive option. I quote what he said: 
The reason that we paid was real simple. It was pure mathematics. [If] it cost me $23,000 to win and $6,000 to lose: I can't afford to win. 
To rub salt into the wounds, so to speak, copies of these settlement checks appeared on one of his worksites in North Carolina with the statement saying that this was the result of employer interference with employee rights. 
Mr. Smith, a hard-working American trying to run an honest business, lost both money and company stature. But this assault was not unique. In 1 year, Little Rock Electrical has faced 72 such charges to the tune of $80,000 in legal fees. 
Mr. President, that is wrong. That is not justice, it is an injustice. This problem is not unique to Arkansas companies. It is happening all across America, from Cape Elizabeth, ME, where Cindy and Don Mailman, owners of Bay Electric Company, suffered 14 erroneous, meritless charges, and $100,000 in legal fees over 4 years; to Modesto, CA, where Jim Blayblock of Blayblock Electric faced an intense barrage of salting; to Delano, MN, where Terrance Korthof of Wright Electric has lost $150,000 in legal fees and $200,000 to $300,000 in wasted time for 15 baseless charges; to Austin, TX, where Randy Pomikahl's company, Randall Electric, has been targeted. 
My point is, from the East Coast to the West Coast, from the Canadian border to Texas in the South we see these salting campaigns. Salts are operating across the country not only in 
electrical companies, but in steel companies, mechanical companies, building companies, and I predict it is going to be expanded and proliferate. We are going to see it targeting small business in every industry unless we address it legislatively. Mr. President, it is very much a national problem. 
I have on the floor of the Senate this morning a chart that illustrates how this is a national problem. Here are some examples of salting cases around the country. Carmel, IN, Gaylor Electric faced 96 charges. Ultimately, the courts dismissed all 96. All 96 of these charges were dismissed without merit, but it cost Gaylor Electric $250,000 annually to defend themselves against this salting campaign. 
Union, MO, 48 charges were filed, 47 were dismissed, one was settled for $200. But in legal fees, $150,000 to defend their company against these frivolous charges. 
In Clearfield, PA, the R.D. Goss Company had 15 to 20 charges. All but one of those charges were dismissed, but it cost that company $75,000 in legal fees plus lost time, and they ultimately were forced out of business, an example of many businesses that have been forced to close their doors because of their inability to pay for the legal help to defend themselves against these kinds of campaigns. This small businessman in Clearfield, PA, had operated for 38 years until finally having to close their doors because of the salting campaign against them. 
These travesties of justice are not simply random acts by a small subversive group. Instead, they are calculated attacks on nonunion companies often, unfortunately, with NLRB complicity. In its most innocuous form, salting consists of gaining employment, not to work, but solely for the purpose of organizing labor. A person has a right, the courts have said and legitimately so, to apply for a job even though they want to go in and help organize for union activity. They don't have a right, I believe, legitimately, morally, or ethically, though it is still illegal, to go in, apply for a job, never intending to work, but simply for the purpose of filing these kinds of frivolous claims. That is in its most innocuous form. The common and prescribed practice is to strike economic pressure points in a company, leaving that company virtually paralyzed. 
In their own words, from the IEBW organizing manual, this is what they say:  
[The goal of salting is to] threaten or actually apply the economic pressure necessary to cause the employer to . . . raise his prices to recoup additional costs, scale back his business activities, leave the union's jurisdiction, and go out of business. 
That is not where the effort is to go in and organize. That is where the effort is to go in, hit the economic pressure points and destroy the company. The international vice president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Tom McNutt, has been quoted as saying: 
If we can't organize them, the best thing to do is to erode their business as much as possible. 
The goal is not to organize. `If we can't organize, let's destroy the company.' 
I have another chart that I think will illustrate this very point, and that is that the procedures for salting are not left to chance, that unions very carefully instruct members how they ought to go about salting. This is a sample checklist for salts put out by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1547 in Anchorage, AK. If you will notice, and we will read some of these points, this is their initial contact, when they make contact with a selected target; in other words, the business that is the target of the campaign: 
If the target doesn't have reason to know that you are a union member you do not want to reflect that on your application. You can change the status of your prior employment to reflect past non-union employment * * * 
Then they actually counsel their salts to lie on their employment application. 
* * * reduce the rate of [your former] pay [your hourly wage] to $12.00 or $13.00 with no benefits [because] if you show a high rate of pay and benefits * * * the target will * * * become suspicious. 
So all through the various points that they make, all through their recommendations, they are urging deception when these salts go in. 
List jobs other than heavy industrial sites such as TVA jobs, government jobs, or jobs known to be union in union areas. 
Deceive the potential employer. 
In listing your electrical education we recommend that you do not list JATC or IBEW. 
Just do not tell them of any kind of--on and on you find this effort to simply deceive in order to get in and perform the insidious and pernicious activity, not of organizing, but of destroying the economic viability of the company. 
There are more union tactics that are described by local 1547: Fabricating employment history and so forth. These tactics are not overt methods of organizing, but rather they are covert methods of deceiving and sabotaging the targeted company. Unfortunately, the NLRB and other Government entities have unwittingly become an accomplice in these salting campaigns, because the charges are brought before them, and Government lawyers defend the salts. 
So we talk about the price tag. It is not just the price tag of legal fees for these companies. It is not just the price tag of lost time and productivity. It is not just the price tag of losing a company's reputation. It is also the price tag that is imposed upon the American taxpayer, because we pay for the lawyers that are defending these salts when it goes before the NLRB. So by extension, the American taxpayers have been made a participant in these guerrilla warfare operations, since who but the American taxpayer pays the salaries of these Government lawyers. 
Mr. President, I think that it is absurd. And in return for their money, the American taxpayers get a return on their investment; and that return is in higher consumer prices for products and services, the costs of which have been driven up by higher operating expenses due to none other than these kinds of salting campaigns and those abuses. Not the legitimate right to organize, but it is these abuses that we have an opportunity to bring a halt to. 
Under current law, employers are fully exposed to the corrosive effects of salting. Mr. President, I emphasize again, I am not opposed to labor organizing. It is, in fact, one of the rights of workers under the law. But I am against the abuse of the system, the abuse of small business owners and the abuse of the American taxpayers. 
The Truth in Employment Act preserves the rights of employees and employers. The provisions are very simple. The Truth in Employment Act amends the National Labor Relations Act so that an employer is not required to employ any person who is not a bona fide employee applicant, meaning that this person wants to be employed with the primary purpose of furthering another employment or agency status. In other words, when they are coming in to apply, they are not coming in primarily because they want a job and they want a paycheck and they want to perform productive labor. They are coming in primarily for the purpose of furthering the goals and objectives of another organization, whether they are paid or unpaid. I think that that is what we must guard against--no destructive salting. 
The bill also specifically protects the rights of bona fide employees to self-organization, labor organization membership, and collective bargaining. It does not change the definition of the employee, and it does not overturn the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The Truth in Employment Act begins, a little bit, to put some balance back into management-labor relations. And it begins to level the playing field of labor relations, protecting the rights of employers and employees while promoting the honest and harmonious hiring of employees. 
I think, Mr. President, the House took a very positive step for the benefit of all Americans by passing their version of this bill on March 26, 1998. This evening we will have a chance to do the same. And the language in the Truth in Employment Act that we will be voting on today is precisely the language passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. 
The question arises, though--I am sure we are going to hear this during the course of debate today--if salts enter into jobs surreptitiously, how can this legislation work? How can salts be detected? Under the Truth in Employment Act, the act of seeking employment in the furtherance of another employment or agency status no longer is a `protected activity.' 
Salting will not be a protected action. In the case against the employer, the general counsel of the NLRB will have to show that the employee is, in fact, bona fide, that the employee did not seek employment for the purpose of salting. In this demonstration, the general counsel will prove that the employee would have sought employment even in the absence of his desire to conduct a salting campaign. 
The employers will have the opportunity to present contrary evidence. Employers will no longer be squeezed in the vices of the law. They will no longer be forced to hire salts or fear dismissing salts for their disruptive actions. Employers will be able to hire job applicants who are actually interested in working and contributing do the company for the salary they receive. 
I know that some of my colleagues do not support this legislation and will try to frame this legislation as being antilabor. It is not. As I mentioned, the Truth in Employment Act specifically protects the rights of bona fide employees to self-organization, labor organization membership, and collective bargaining. It does not in any way undermine that right. But it will stop the proliferation of salting campaigns that have precipitated the need for the legislation. This, frankly, has become the new tactic of choice. 
Others may suggest these unions would not undertake these tactics unless there were something seriously wrong with the system and that salting is like the last gasp of breath from the sea of desperation. But I think if you look at the economy, you find the real answer. 
Apart from the recent ups and downs and antics of the stock market, our economy has been doing very well. Over 13 million new jobs have been created in the last 5 years. Unemployment is at a 24-year low--4.5 percent. The economy is growing. And while the economy is growing, union membership is declining; in fact, it is even plummeting. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported recently that unions lost 159,000 members in 1997 alone. So as a result of strong employment conditions and job satisfaction, labor unions are finding it increasingly difficult to identify workplaces that need and want labor representation. So in that circumstance, in that economic environment, it is regrettable that some labor unions have resorted to disingenuous techniques to cope with their situation. 
Mr. President, in this country we often speak of rights--the right to free speech, the right to free assembly, the right to bear arms, the right to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. But with each right that we enjoy in this great country, we also face some responsibilities. People who assemble for a cause have the responsibility not to be violent or to be destructive. Journalists have a responsibility to print what is true and newsworthy. 
When a parent grants a child the freedom to use the phone or to use the car, he expects the child not to make lengthy long distance calls to far out-of-the-way places, or to drive the car at high speeds or under the influence of alcohol. It is this responsibility that we exercise with each freedom, with each right that allows us to have these very same freedoms. Mr. President, the right of laborers to organize must not be abused. 
Salting is a costly--costly--abuse of legal technicalities. It rarely ever results in actual organization. Instead, it costs small business owners time, money and oftentimes its reputation that has been built and earned through a whole lifetime. It costs American taxpayers money in legal costs and higher consumer prices. It is dishonest. It is unjust, and it penalizes the innocent. 
Mr. President, the Truth in Employment Act calls for just that--truth in employment. It calls for common sense and honesty in labor relations. It calls for job applicants to be honest about their intentions and to apply only if they actually want to work for the company. It stops only dishonesty. It stops only injustice. It stops only destructive and unethical practices. It calls for a simple change in the law so that small business owners do not have to shoot themselves in the foot. It calls for fairness. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation when we have the opportunity to vote on it later today. 
Mr. President, 32 different trade associations have endorsed the Truth in Employment Act. I will not read them all, but some of the major trade associations supporting this legislation include the American Trucking Association, the Associated Builders and Contractors, International Mass Retail Association, the National Association of Convenience Stores, the National Association of Home Builders, the National Association of Manufacturers support this, as well as the NFIB, National Federation of Independent Business, the National Grocers Association, the National Mining Association, the National Restaurant Association, the National Retail Federation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--32 different associations have said, `We realize this is an insidious, unscrupulous practice that will proliferate unless we stop it legislatively now.' 
While it may now be electrical contractors, small builders and small businesses facing this, unless the insidious practice is stopped, we will see it used in a calculating way against targeted industries and targeted businesses across the economic spectrum. 
This is a great opportunity for us, as we seek to invoke cloture on this, this evening. We need 60 votes. I ask all of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to carefully consider the simple change that this will make in the law, but the profound change it would have in restoring fairness in the workplace. 
Mr. President, how much time remains?

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, while the clock is burning, I think it is an appropriate time for me to take a few moments here and relate and include in the Record some of the correspondence I have been privy to concerning what small businesses are facing under the salting campaigns aimed against them and targeting them. These are only samples, but I think they are good samples of businesses across the country. I hope the Senators from these various States we are looking at will think seriously about what their constituents are facing in these targeting campaigns. 
This particular letter is from Kenny Electric Service and was addressed to the Honorable Dan Schaefer in the State of Colorado. Colorado, of course, like all States across the country, is facing these kinds of campaigns. And because of the building movement in Colorado, I think they have been a particular target. They have many electrical contractors, building contractors, and small business people of various sorts who are facing this and are involved in the building trades industry. 
I will read the last paragraph in which the letter states: 
Kenny Electric Service, Inc. has experienced financial losses of over $1 million as a result of union tactics and harassment. Attached are examples of harassment which caused these losses. Your help with the legislation will sincerely be appreciated. 
Then they stipulate some of the expenses that they have incurred. He said: 
We had a van with 7 union members arrive at our office to respond to an ad that we ran for an electrician. They were followed by the director of organizing, who was video taping the whole process. 
The above resulted in an NLRB charge, even though some of them were indeed hired. The NLRB charge was ultimately removed [and dropped] by the union [itself]. 
The union members filed frivolous and sometimes false OSHA claims. For instance, one day the contractor's office trailer was locked up at 7 a.m. The trailer had the drinking water in it for the job. The contractor arrived at 7:15 a.m. and opened the trailer. The union member had already called OSHA and filed the complaint because water was not available for 15 minutes. It took me 3 hours to file the appropriate OSHA report to avoid a fine and a claim. 
Then he goes on with another full page of similar examples of the frivolous claims that were filed against their company and the over $1 million in costs that were incurred.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have a letter from Manno Electric, Inc., from the president of that company to his Congressman, regarding forced unionism, or salting. I will read only one paragraph: 
My company, Manno Electric, Inc., became a target for salting in July 1992. We are a small firm, founded in 1972, and based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Our business has been family-owned and operated for the past 24 years and now has annual sales of approximately $1 million and an average work force of 25 employees. 
In July 1992, I hired five union members during a peak work time and laid them off when their jobs were completed in mid-August 1992. Immediately, the union filed a ULP charge claiming they were laid off because of their union affiliation. 
I will not read it all, but it concludes: 
To date, I have paid my attorney over $75,000 for my defense and have been ruled guilty on all charges by an administrative law judge who proudly professed he formerly represented the auto union and touted the high percentage of success in union litigation. 
Once again, he is continuing to appeal. But these are the kinds of situations that these small companies are facing. That is from the State of Louisiana, Baton Rouge.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Then I have a letter written by Betty Tyson at T&B Metal Works, Inc. I believe it does sheet metal duct work in Jacksonville, FL. This was addressed to the Honorable Tillie Fowler, a Congresswoman from Jacksonville, FL, regarding the Truth in Employment Act in 1996 in the House of Representatives, H.R. 3211. 
Once again, I will not read all of this correspondence. But part of what Betty Tyson writes is the following:  
T&B Metal Works, Inc. has been in business for 10 years and is a sheet metal company which fabricates and installs duct work in commercial buildings. Presently, it is unlawful for a business to refuse to hire a job applicant because he is a union organizer or union member. Therefore, we have hired several `organizers' from Sheet Metal Local 435 over the past 10 months (since the organizing campaign began). The problem is, these people are not trying to organize our employees--they simply do everything they can think of to disrupt our business by filing false charges, and are hiding behind the labor laws which were created to protect employees. 
Then there are a number of specific details that are provided regarding the situation that T&B Metal Works face in Jacksonville, FL. I have a binder with similar letters and examples from all of the States of the Union. This is something that is becoming very broad-based and is becoming a widespread problem for small businesses struggling to survive and provide jobs for working people of this country.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Then I have before me an editorial that appeared in the Anchorage Times on December 17, 1996. You will notice that most of the correspondence and editorials that have been written have occurred within the last 2, 3 years, because it is during this time period that this problem has become so exacerbated, become so widely used by union organizers who are having little success in organizing otherwise, and they are going to these very destructive tactics. 
This was written December 17, 1996, in the Anchorage Times, and I think the title of the editorial is significant: `Do Bad Real Good.' In this case, it was actually a city that was facing a union salting campaign, and the threats that were made by the IBEW representatives were so egregious that it received widespread attention. I will read part of that editorial: 
In a meeting with Mayor Margie Johnson in November, according to City Manager Scott Janke, the IBEW representatives threatened the community with great financial harm. 
The IBEW representative said: 
By the time we get finished with this town, it will make the open meeting lawsuit your town was in look like chicken feed. 
That cost the town over a million dollars in legal fees. So the union organizer representative said it was going to be `chicken feed' compared to what they were going to do. 
He said: 
Your town can't afford it, but we can. We will take out advertisements in the paper. We will ruin you. 
* * * What we will do is rip this town apart. 
Then he said: 
We do bad real good. 
It is that abuse, which is so often explicitly and blatantly stated, which this legislation would address.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, while I continue to have the floor, I just want to point to this chart, which is an editorial that I think very well frames the issue that confronts the Senate today in this cloture motion. 
It is entitled `Harassing Job Providers.' It appeared recently in the Detroit News. I think, once again, it frames this issue quite well. I will read part of it. 
One form of the tactic is called `salting' in which union agents take a job at a nonunion firm and attempt to organize workers. They also file endless and often frivolous claims of labor law violations against the companies. Another tactic is simply to file the claims on behalf of other workers, whether or not the workers are actually aggrieved. 
These tactics, as well as `salting,' are known as corporate campaigns and are designed to give unions more leverage when they are at a low ebb. Only 10 percent of private sector workers are in unions. One prounion handbook quoted by Investors Business Daily observes that `Every law or regulation is a potential net in which management can be snared and entangled. 
I think they rightly conclude that: 
Regulations ought to be about protecting people, not `ensnaring and entangling' anyone. Part of the problem is addressed by legislation introduced by Republicans Harris Fawell of Illinois in the House and * * *.' 
And it goes on and speaks about that legislation. 
But here is the point I would make; I think the editorial made it well: Regulations, labor laws, and labor regulations implemented by the NLRB exist not to ensnare and entangle small business men and women who are trying to survive, trying to provide jobs and trying to make a living. They exist to protect both employer and employee and have always been intended to provide and to maintain balance. The fact is that when the National Labor Relations Act was passed no one could have envisioned that these kinds of tactics would become so commonplace. 
So when the opponents of this legislation stand, as they surely will, and say, `This is just an effort to undermine and to hurt organizing efforts, this is antiworker and antilabor,' I once again remind those Senators that the only thing this legislation targets are the abuses of existing law. The only thing this legislation targets are the insidious and absolutely indefensible tactics of going in with the explicit purpose of destroying a business, destroying a businesswoman, of ruining their financial viability with a truly scorched earth policy, a term that has been used frequently of recent. This is truly scorched earth. If you can't organize and destroy them, that is what `salting' is all about. That is why it is incumbent upon us to restore balance and to restrain these kinds of unethical tactics that are being more and more widely used. 
Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time under the quorum call be equally divided.

<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, after listening to Senator Kennedy, I feel I should start by checking to see if I have horns that ought to be removed. I wasn't sure, frankly, whether we were debating minimum wage, family and medical leave, Davis-Bacon, comp time, OSHA, campaign finance team or summer jobs program. 
I know that while there is concern about the amount of time we are spending on what Senator Kennedy feels is an inappropriate bill, the total amount of time designated and agreed upon is 2 1/2 hours equally divided on this cloture motion. I think to the thousands of small businesses across this country, their owners and their families, this is certainly worth 2 1/2 hours on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I know that many businesses in the State of Massachusetts are certainly worth the time we are devoting to the subject today. 
While Senator Kennedy may be concerned that people have not read the bill, it is 3 1/2 pages long. I suspect that any Senator, between now and this evening, will have time not only to study it and to study its impact, but also perhaps to read some of the hundreds and hundreds of letters that every Senator in this body has received on this subject. 
For the sake of those who may not have time to read what I think is very important in this bill, I want to read it for the sake of my colleagues and the sake of the manager of the other side, because while part of the bill was quoted, a big part of the bill was not cited. It is this:  
Provided, That this sentence shall not affect the rights and responsibilities under this Act of any employee who is or was a bona fide employee applicant, including the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protections. 
That is language directly from the National Labor Relations Act. We say there is nothing in this bill that can possibly infringe upon the right of a worker to do what they have always done. Salting has not been an accepted practice. Disrupting the workplace, causing economic damage, seeking to destroy one's employer, has never been an accepted organizing strategy in this country, nor should it be. That is all this legislation would restrict. 
I suggest that when we talk about families, that we realize that small business men and women in this country have families, too. That they are workers, too. To invest a lifetime building a small business, building jobs and an economic future for their employees, to have that destroyed by this insidious practice is indefensible. I am amazed that anybody would stand and defend the practice of salting. 
Now, we heard a couple of examples, I think, that mischaracterize what salting is. They say it is organizing. There is nothing in this bill that would prevent organizing. In fact, it specifically says that. So, please, let's not have red herrings thrown in. A small contractor in the Boston, MA, area has experienced numerous cases of union salts coming into the company under the presumption that at the open-shop company they would have low wages and no benefits. That is what they were told. 
Every union salt came to realize that not only had the working conditions at the open shop been mischaracterized, but they were subjecting the company to an immoral and unscrupulous practice designed to harm the company. These employees and their families were later threatened by union members. Some compelling letters were received from employees to their union representatives saying they will quit the union and expressing disgust with the unscrupulous tactics they were put up to. 
Let me read from one, and I will not use the names because I think that would be unfair. This letter is very moving. She mentioned the name of the company: 
. . . doesn't deserve the disgrace and shame local 12 wants me to bring upon them. Every one at [the company] has worked too hard to have this done by me. I can't do it. I have been raised different. How can I raise my kids by setting an example like this. 
I have decided to sever my time with local 12 [in Boston, MA.] After 2 years, I'm finally there. If this is how I have to get it, I don't want it. 
And then she mentioned her employer's name. 
Please do not contact me by phone, mail or in person. 
I would like to remain an employee of [this company] but I understand and deserve termination. . . . Do as you see fit. 
I would strongly recommend to anyone involved in local 12's program, [that is referring to the salting program] to get out. 
I don't know how I could face you and do what they want me to do. I'm sorry I've betrayed you. I would like to apologize. 
There are many salts we heard from, former salts who said, `I got out. It was too dirty. It was too much of an unscrupulous business to be part of it. I got out.' 
That is what we want to ban--not legitimate organizing, but this destructive tactic to go only to destroy the company. In their own words, from the State of Massachusetts, the organizing report of the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades, Roslindale, MA, this is what they wrote: 
This is the opportunity to strip these nonunion contractors of their most skilled workers and put the nonunion contractor in a situation where they won't be able to fulfill their contract obligations. 
That is not me. It is their own words. Not their best workers, but to strip them of skilled workers. 
They say: 
We are stripping quality workers from these shops, weakening their ability to man their jobs. Our intent with this company and companies like them is to put them out of business or have them sign on the bottom line and become a union shop. Our efforts at this major nonunion shop have resulted in a victory from the council. We stripped away the best of their workers so far. They stopped advertising for help, and in fact, they put a freeze on all hiring. This has impeded [the Company's] day-to-day running daily. They need workers at this busy time of year, but they cannot hire. The word from our sources in the company is they will use a temp agency to hire workers. This will result in their having difficulty getting quality, long-term workers and will drag down their standard of worker. We know [the Company] has already been kicked off from one job for not getting it done on time. The less work this painting contractor does, the more there is for our signatory contractors to take on, and the stronger we get. 
That is in their own words. 
You can either accept salting is legitimate, salting is just an organizing tactic, or you could listen to their own manual and to their own reports that their goal is to destroy small businesses. And that's wrong. 
It isn't impinging upon the rights of workers to organize, to collectively bargain. It is saying there is a right way to do it and there is a wrong way. This was never envisioned when the National Labor Relations Act was passed and it should be prohibited. 
In 1996, there were over 17,000 complaints to the NLRB. This isn't a rare, isolated thing. There are thousands of frivolous complaints. The cost when they are investigating, $17,500 of taxpayers' money just to investigate these frivolous charges. That is what we are dealing with. 
May I inquire as to how much time remains?

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, sometimes when I hear debate on the floor of the Senate, I wonder what bill we are debating or whether the bill being spoken of is actually reflected in the specific provisions. 
I remind my colleagues once again that this bill does not overturn the Supreme Court decision, the unanimous Supreme Court decision. It does not infringe whatsoever on the rights of employees to organize. It specifically states in a provision added on page 4, the last part of the last statement in the bill, that nothing in this shall infringe upon or affect the rights and responsibilities of the employee. It comes straight from the Labor Relations Act that says nothing in this can infringe upon that. It says that an employer doesn't have to hire someone whose--it doesn't infringe if they want to organize, for whatever reason, whatever the cost, or whatever thought. It says that if your primary goal in taking that job is not to fulfill the responsibilities of the job but is to further the goals of another organization or another agency, that employer is not bound to hire you. And, yes, they can file a discrimination suit. But now the burden would be upon the NLRB lawyers to demonstrate that, in fact, this person was a bona fide employee applicant. 
So the employees' rights are absolutely and totally protected under this legislation. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Gorton of Washington and Senator Kyl be added as cosponsors to this bill.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Once again, we get this impression that has been presented this morning that somehow these are legitimate organizing efforts. Yet, I have read quotation after quotation from the IBEW and other unions' own organizing manuals that make it very clear that the goal is, in fact, to economically destroy the company and the employer. 
So I will throw one more in. This is the IBEW Organizing News Letter, volume No. 1, March 1995, on page 4: 
These companies know that when they are targeted with stripping, salting, and market recovery funds, it is only a matter of time before their foundations begin to crumble. The NLRB charges the attorney fees, and the loss of employees can lead to an unprofitable business. 
That is what they want. If they can't organize, they destroy them economically. But it not only destroys them economically, it costs the taxpayers, because we are paying the NLRB attorneys, and it ruins the reputation of good, hard-working Americans who have invested their lives in building businesses. I can't think of anything more tragic than to spend your life building a business--spending 30 years out there starting as a mom-and-pop operation and gradually adding employees, providing a good place of employment for workers--and then, through this pernicious tactic, see your business destroyed and have to close your doors, to see those jobs lost, and to say that somehow this is antiworker. 
I will tell you what is antiworker. It is those who would use that kind of an unconscionable tactic to destroy the economic viability of a business. Yes, it ought to be legal to organize; that is something that ought to be protected by law; it is a precious right of workers in this country. But it is not a right to go in and destroy the economic viability of a company or business of a small business owner. That is wrong. I find it amazing that anybody could come down and defend that kind of tactic. All in the world this legislation would do is stop those kinds of tactics. 
Mr. President, when a union salt goes home to his family, his wife, his son, his daughter, and his wife says to him at the end of that day, `Honey, how was your day?' or that child says, `Daddy, how was your day?' can he look his wife or child in the eye and say, `Oh, I had a great day. I participated in the destruction of a hard-working American's life dream and his livelihood'? 
I hope my colleagues will support this legislation. 
I yield the floor.

If you will look at the language in the bill, clearly the primary purpose is to go in to further the goals of an organization or agency. If we go to apply for a job--I ask for the Senator's opinion of this--it is my understanding that if you apply for the job, the primary purpose would be to fulfill the job, and it is not the primary purpose to fulfill the goals of the organization. That is why the employer would not be required to hire the employee under that. He would not fit the definition of a bona fide employee.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. You were speaking very positively about the changes in China. My question is, How do we reconcile the recent round of arrests that occurred in the 2 weeks--actually, the week subsequent to the President's visit--headlined in all of the newspapers across the country? Those who had attempted to register as an opposition political party and were arrested, some of whom are still incarcerated, as well as the tests of rocket engines that occurred even while the President was in China, how do we reconcile that with this supposed great reform that is taking place in China? And then also, the question I would pose is, The amendment that you are opposing simply says that visas should not be granted to those who are involved in forcing--compelling--abortions on women against their will and those who are involved in persecution of religious believers of various faiths. Do you oppose denying visas to those individuals who are involved in forced abortions and religious persecution?

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, coerced abortion and religious persecution are two practices that the Chinese Communist Government denies take place in China. 
How, then, would denying visas to Chinese officials in which we have credible evidence that, in fact, they are doing--how would that impede the kind of positive relationship that you want to see? 
I again reiterate the questions: How do we reconcile the most recent rounds of arrests of those who tried to form a democracy party in China when they were detained and incarcerated? And the test of the rocket engines while the President was in China, how do we reconcile that with this supposed breeze of freedom that we now have blowing through China?

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Abraham amendment 2964 to the Defense appropriations bill. The Abraham amendment would authorize additional human rights monitors at the embassy in Beijing, China, as well as our other consulates around China. I think it is exceptionally warranted. It is very, very much needed. 
The Chinese Government has repeatedly flaunted its lack of respect for human rights. We have seen how the Government controls its people through registration, through coercive and repressive practices. We have seen how the Chinese Government punishes those who would dare to worship by the dictates of their conscience. We have seen how the Government punishes those who would speak in the name of democracy, those who would seek to register an opposition political party. They punish those who simply seek to fulfill normal human aspirations, aspirations that we too often take for granted. 
We have seen that in the last two, at least the last two annual State Department reports on human rights that China was found to be one of, if not the worst human rights abuser in the world today. I think that fact alone, the fact that our State Department, in monitoring the countries of the world, the nations of the world, issuing reports on human rights conditions in the various nations of the world, found China as the greatest abuser of human rights justifies the Abraham amendment in establishing additional human rights monitors, additional personnel in the embassy to monitor situations like this: `Chinese Resume Arrests,' so that we will have the kind of knowledge about what is going on in the area of human rights within China that will allow us to, I think, engage China in the correct way. 
Mr. President, we do not expect that China will change overnight, nor do we expect that the amendment that I have offered dealing with forced abortions and religious persecution, or the amendment that Senator Abraham has offered will magically produce the change that we all desire. But it is essential that we shed light on the kind of human rights abuses, the dark practices that have become too evident for too many years. And it is essential that we engage those abuses with a substantive response. 
This is part of that substantive response. The question before us is not whether we contain and isolate China. We cannot do that. We should not do that. We would not want to do that. The question before us is whether or not we will engage them on issues of human rights, as well as trade, as well as national security issues, whether we will actually engage them, and in so doing support the cause of freedom. 
Frankly, I am puzzled by those who would excuse themselves and pardon themselves by saying that they, too, are opposed to the human rights abuses in China but then would oppose any effort to have a substantive response to those human rights abuses. 
So I believe that this is not only a well-intended but a well-drafted amendment. It is, once again, part of the package that passed in the House of Representatives now almost a year ago with overwhelming bipartisan support, and it is long past time for the Senate to weigh in on that; to support the monitoring of human rights abuses in China, as we seek to do throughout the world; to give the kinds of personnel to our State Department, to our diplomatic people to assure that we have the best intelligence, the best reporting possible. 
It is, I think, evident that this is needed in light of this latest round of arrests of political dissidents in China. It is puzzling to me that we can talk about the great improvement in China and the reforms that are taking place, and that this administration could put so much faith in President Jiang and his regime in Beijing when all of the evidence that is forthcoming, whether it is in the media, through our intelligence agencies, or the State Department itself indicates that, in fact, those abuses are as bad as ever, and that the crackdown on religious believers is now only most recently exceeded by the crackdown on political dissidents. I do believe, as the President has expressed, that eventually China will be free. I believe that. I think someday China will be a country in which free expression is tolerated and the freedoms that are not American values, but are fundamental human values, will exist in China. 
But I think it will not be through the regime that rules with an iron fist in Beijing, China, today. So, let us engage, but let us engage thoroughly and on all fronts. 
The package of amendments that is before the Senate today will enable us to do that. So it is essential that we not table the China amendments, that we support them, that we agree to them as part of the appropriations bill. I believe, because the House passed these measures by such an overwhelming vote, they will be preserved in the conference and we will be able to give the President an opportunity to truly involve this administration in an engagement policy that will reflect the values that are precious to us and help to bring about the change that we desire to see in China and to give support to the freedom fighters, freedom lovers in China today who risk the limited freedom that they have to go about their daily activities by speaking out, by seeking to form an opposition political party, by seeking to worship according to the dictates of their conscience. 
I think it is so imperative that we go on record with these amendments, to stand shoulder to shoulder with those who are putting their lives and their limited liberty at stake by taking a far more dangerous stand there, in China, today. 
I applaud Senator Abraham for bringing the human rights monitors amendment to the floor of the Senate, and I look forward to casting my vote against tabling and for the amendment. I ask my colleagues to do likewise. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, thank you for bringing the Senate to order. 
This is an amendment that would simply deny visas and travel to those in the Chinese Government who the Secretary of State finds, by credible evidence, are involved in either forced abortions or religious persecution. It is not MFN, it is not IMF, it is not sanctions, but it would deny visas. China denies these practices are taking place. If that is the case, there would be no obstruction at all in diplomatic relations. 
We provide in the amendment, and I hope everybody will look closely at the amendment, a Presidential waiver if it is in the national interest. This amendment passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives. I think, since the President returned, the most recent round of arrests of democratic dissidents underscores the need for this amendment. 
It is a rifleshot, not a shotgun. We want to go after the bad guys, and that is all. It is not against trading. It doesn't deal with trading. A vote against tabling this amendment is a vote for freedom in China. 
I ask my colleagues to oppose the tabling motion.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the Senators on the other side of the aisle who, I think, have made very positive and productive suggestions to improve the amendment that I have offered regarding human rights abuses in China. 
The simple explanation for the changes that are made, we have made the bill generic in nature rather than country-specific. I have some reservations about that because I don't want to in any way dilute, I think, the proper attention that should be placed upon what our State Department says is the greatest abusers of human rights in the world today. But at the same time, I think this makes this a very, very powerful human rights amendment applicable to all nations of the world. The `finding' section of the amendment remains in which we are able to outline some of the abuses evident in China today. 
We would add, I think, a positive suggestion, that the genital mutilation issue be added. So in addition to religious persecution and forced abortions, genital mutilation and those who would condone it would be added as criteria for those countries that would be denied their visas for those condoning that practice, the terrible practice that human rights advocates the world over and all people, I think, condemn. 
I want to thank Senator Biden for, I think, some very good suggestions regarding the `definitions' area on the Secretary's obligations in determining who would be denied these visas. The addition to the phrase `credible information,' adding `and specific information,' and adding to the phrase `has been involved in the establishment or enforcement,' the word `directly'; so, `has been directly involved in the establishment or enforcement of population control policies.' I think that is a very helpful change that will make this much more enforceable and make it much more clear. I am grateful for that suggestion, as well. 
We have struck section 9012, which simply lists a number of associations and organizations which are agents of the government in carrying out some of these abuses. It is really unnecessary, an unnecessary provision that has caused confusion, because anyone, any individual, any official, who is involved in perpetrating persecution of religious minorities, coerced abortions or the genital mutilation would be covered by the amendment, without what is really extraneous language and unnecessary language. 
So I think these are all very positive changes and that is the content of the second-degree amendment. I think this is relevant. I think it is a very positive improvement to the appropriations bill. I appreciate the support of those on both sides of the aisle in the defeat of the motion to table.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I turn, I believe, to an issue of great, great importance to this body and to the Nation. In defending his policy before he left for China, President Clinton said: 
We do not ignore the value of symbols, but in the end, if the choice is between making a symbolic point and making a real difference, I choose to make a difference. 
I say to my colleagues, today we have a chance to make a difference. The President went on and said: 
When it comes to advancing human rights and religious freedom, dealing directly, speaking honestly with the Chinese is clearly the best way to make a difference. 
While in China, President Clinton was allowed to make some tempered remarks on human rights abuses in China, though, unfortunately, he was quick to equate them with problems in America. He came back from China hailing his trip as a success and praising President Jiang and saying--I quote again-- `feeling the breeze of freedom.' 
Only a week after President Clinton's return from China, China demonstrated the impact of this rhetoric on their attitude and their policies by arresting 10 democracy advocates. There their crime was not rape. It was not theft. It was not burglary. It was not grand larceny. It was not fraud. Their crime was that they dared to start a democratic opposition party. 
The Washington Post reported--it is obvious in the headline--on Sunday, July 12, on the front page, `Chinese Resume Arrests, 10 Detained a Week after Clinton Visit.' 
Fortunately, five of these activists were subsequently released. But when the supporters of democracy protested these arrests in an open letter to the Communist Government, it was no surprise the Chinese Government kindly responded by arresting yet another dissident, Xu Wenli. 
According to the Associated Press, on July 24, 1998, the Chinese Government detained four more dissidents, bringing the known number of detained dissidents since the President returned from China to 21. Twenty-one dissidents have been detained since July 10, and three remain in custody at this moment. 
On July 29, the Associated Press reported that the Chinese Government detained the democracy activist Wang Youcai for the second time this month. I will simply say, this is not the `breeze of freedom,' but it is rather the draft of repression. 
Some would like to argue that President Clinton's televised comments in China were a historic breakthrough in emboldening democracy activists throughout China. Unfortunately, the President's remarks were broadcast in the middle of the day when few Chinese were watching television. His remarks were not repeated on the evening news and were completely omitted from the next day's state-controlled newspapers. I remind my colleagues also that Chinese activists already had their momentum, and that momentum was of their own creation from the 1989 demonstrations at Tiananmen Square. 
We see that President Clinton spoke directly to the Chinese people, at least some of them. We see the symbolic point that he made, but what we do not see is that there was any difference made in the policy of the Chinese Government. In fact, their response was one of impudence, one of, if you will, a reinforcement of their policy of repression, and I believe the arrests that the Washington Post and all the major media in our country spoke of within a week of the President's return is testimony to the failure of our policy of appeasement. 
As this chart is on the floor of the Senate with that headline, `Chinese Resume Arrests,' it stands as, I think, irrefutable evidence that the current policies failed to bring about the desired changes, the changes that we all desire in China. 
They resumed arrests. A policy of appeasement has never worked, and it is not working today. Today, we, as a body, have the opportunity to move beyond rhetoric into real action with the amendment that I have offered. 
The amendment is composed of two parts: one dealing with forced abortions and one dealing with religious persecution in China. This will have brought most of the House-passed measures last year--the Chinese freedom policy measures sponsored by my good friend and colleague, Chris Cox--this will have brought most of those now to a vote in the Senate. I am glad to say that my friend, Spence Abraham, the Senator from Michigan, intends to offer the human rights monitors amendment later on this bill. 
I am also glad that an amendment that I had filed dealing with satellite technology transfers and moving the authority for that waiver process back to the State Department and away from the Commerce Department is, as I speak, being worked out in the State Department authorization conference committee, and I trust and hope that it will be in that conference report when it is presented to the Senate later. 
I want to provide my colleagues with some background on this amendment. As many of my colleagues will recall, in November of last year, a number of China-related bills were overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives. This is that package of bills sponsored by Congressman Cox, a `policy for freedom,' it was called. Since that time, most of these measures have languished in Senate committees without hearings, without movement and without consideration. 
On the defense authorization bill, we adopted several of these House provisions that I offered at that time. However, the remainder of those were not passed because my efforts to offer them were thwarted by those who did not desire to have that debate on these China provisions before or during the President's trip to China. I simply say the President has returned. This is our opportunity now. 
My amendment, which I am glad to say is bipartisan and that Senator Wellstone from Minnesota, who is on the floor--and I welcome his remarks in support of this--is cosponsoring this amendment, mirrors the language that passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives last November. 
The provision on forced abortions--by the way, the Nuremberg Tribunal on War Crimes condemned forced abortions, rightfully, as being a crime against humanity. This is not a pro-life, pro-choice issue. 
Pro-choicers overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives voted for this provision because this is, in fact, a crime against humanity. 
To compel and to force--to use coercion--take a woman in the seventh, eighth, ninth month of pregnancy and compel her, against her wishes, to have an abortion, that is a crime against humanity. That is why that provision in the House of Representatives passed by a vote of 415-1--415-1. 
The second provision, the `free the clergy' portion, of the amendment passed the House of Representatives last November by a vote of 366-54. 
Now, what does the amendment do? It condemns religious persecution and forced abortion in China. The amendment would prohibit the use of American funds, appropriated to the Department of State, the USIA or AID, to pay for the travel of Communist officials involved in repressing worship or religious persecution. 
So where there is credible evidence that these officials are engaged in these horrendous practices, they would be denied visa approval, they would be denied travel expenses, per diem by the American Government, by the American taxpayer. It would deny visas to officials engaged in religious persecution and forced abortion. 
The amendment would force the Department of State to raise, in every bilateral and multilateral forum, the issues of individuals in prison, detained, confined, or otherwise harassed by the Chinese Government on religious grounds. It simply means that we are going to require our diplomats, when engaging in bilateral and multilateral discussions, to raise these important issues of religious persecution and forced abortions so that that discussion and our concern--the concern of the American people--is reflected by our diplomatic corps. 
This amendment would make freedom of religion one of the major objectives of the United States foreign policy with respect to China. 
And lastly, concerning religious persecution, this amendment would demand that Chinese Government officials provide the United States State Department with the specific names of individuals, the individuals' whereabouts, the condition of those individuals, the charges against them, and the sentence that it imposed against them. 
So individuals who have been arrested and incarcerated because of their faith, because of their religious practice, we would demand that the Chinese Government provide information about the condition, the whereabouts of those individuals and how long the sentence was. The same would be applied to those engaged in forced abortions. 
Mr. President, since the founding of the People's Republic of China almost 50 years ago, the Government has savaged and persecuted religious believers and subjected religious groups in China to comprehensive control by the state and the Chinese Communist Party. 
The head of the state's Religious Affairs Bureau said in 1996--and I quote the head of the Religious Affairs Bureau in China--`Our aim is not registration for its own sake, but control.' Let me say that again. He said, `Our aim is not just registration, but control over places for religious activities as well as over all religious activities themselves.' 
When people say there is religious freedom in China, that they only require registration, please realize, the purpose of that registration is to control religious activities in China, an effort that they have been quite successful at. So religious organizations today in China are required to promote socialism and `patriotism' while the massive state party propaganda apparatus vigorously attempts to promote atheism and combat what they call `superstition.' 
Mr. President, the Chinese Government, the Communist Party, have in recent years intensified efforts to expel religious believers from the Government, the military, and the party, ordering a nationwide purge of believers in January of 1995. 
I am very concerned about the mounting campaign of religious persecution being waged by the rulers of China. I believe this amendment is the least that we can do. Many of my colleagues have said that using trade policy is the wrong instrument in dealing with the repressive practices of the Chinese Government. I understand. In fact, I am sympathetic to that argument. 
I never thought that most-favored-nation status was the best tool that we had, and yet when we come with a proposal like this, one that I have visited with Senator Wellstone about, and many of my colleagues about, when we come with one that denies visas and denies travel and per diem for those involved in these terrible practices, then I hear people saying that is the wrong tool to use, we should not use visas. This is the very least that we can do. If we are not willing to deal with the $60 billion trade deficit that we give China--trade imbalance that we have with that country--then the least we can do is come back on this issue of visas, travel expenses, and raising the issue in our diplomacy and diplomatic efforts with the Chinese Government and make this something more than mere rhetoric. 
I believe that these amendments are modest, that they are temperate, that they are well thought out. They have been repeatedly debated, not only in the House of Representatives but on the floor of the Senate as well. 
I will ask my colleagues to support the amendments and to oppose any effort to table these amendments. I believe that there is clear evidence not only of religious persecution among Evangelical believers, among Roman Catholic believers, but most obviously among Buddhist believers and the followers of the Dalai Lama. The repression ranges from ransacking homes in Tibet in search of banned pictures of the Dalai Lama to the closing and destroying of over 18,000 Buddhist shrines last spring. So the repression is real. And religious faith of all persuasions is in revival in China, but it is in revival in the face of intense persecution by the Chinese Government. 
I will only briefly speak of the practice of forced abortions that are going on in China today. I believe that this is a practice that is indefensible by any civilized human being. In their effort and attempt to reach a 1 percent annual population growth, the Chinese authorities, in 1979, issued regulations that provided monetary bonuses and other benefits, as incentives, and economic penalties for those who would have in excess of one child. 
They subject families in China to rigorous pressure to end pregnancies and to undergo sterilizations. And while the Communist Chinese Government today says that coercion is not an approved policy, they admit that it goes on. They have not provided our State Department any evidence that they are punishing the perpetrators of that terrible practice of coerced abortions and forced sterilizations in China today. 
Even more tragic is their effort to eliminate those they regard as `defective.' China's eugenics policy, the so-called natal and health care law, requires couples at risk of transmitting disabling congenital defects to their children to undergo sterilization. 
So the practices continue in China; the abuses continue in China. This amendment is the very least that we can do in clear conscience. I have faith that my colleagues are going to support this amendment. I think it is something that is so essential that we do. This practice of coerced abortions--and, may I add, the practice of persecuting believers, religious believers --is morally reprehensible and indefensible. 
It is clear, as well, that the desired changes that the policy of so-called constructive engagement has sought has failed. 
I once again point to this headline in the Washington Post, which was, in various forms, the front page story all across this country this month: `Chinese Resume Arrests'--that in the wake of our President's visit to China. 
So please look at the temperate tone of these amendments. Realize that the substance is simply denying visas, travel expenses, if you will, American-taxpayer-subsidized travel, in recognition of those who the State Department, the Secretary of State, has credible evidence indicating that they are involved in these inhumane practices. 
I ask my colleagues to support this amendment when we vote this afternoon. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is with some reluctance that I respond to the comments, because I have such utmost respect for the Senator from Hawaii and his distinguished career, and all that he represents. 
But I just want to clarify the perspective of the authors of this amendment. The issue is not imposing American values. Frankly, we don't and we can't impose anything on another nation. But what we can say is that the values are important. 
I think it is terribly wrong to try to make a moral equivalency argument and say that examples of religious persecution that may exist in the United States can in any stretch of the imagination be compared to the wholesale religious oppression that exists in China today. 
We simply don't have headlines in the Washington Post saying that there were `10 detained in Arkansas' because of their religious beliefs. We don't have that in this country, and we shouldn't. If we did there would be an outrage, and if we did we should be condemned by other nations in the world. 
So the issue is not imposing American values. The issue is whether or not we as a body and we as a nation want to reflect certain fundamental beliefs and fundamental rights. 
I add that these are not American values that we speak of. These are not American values that this amendment is addressing. These are human values. They are basic human rights. 
It was not the U.S. Supreme Court that I quoted in condemnation of forced abortion. It was the Nuremberg War Tribunal that said forced abortion is a crime against humanity. 
These are human values. We cannot excuse a nation by saying they are new at this thing of freedom. No. In fact, it is not that the communist rulers of China don't understand freedom. It is that they understand freedom all too well, and they are determined to repress it. 
The issue in China is control, and the Chinese Communist Government is determined to use whatever means necessary and whatever means at their disposal to insure that they maintain control, even to the point of persecuting those who might say there is a power above and beyond the power of the Chinese Government. 
I say to my distinguished colleague from Hawaii that the issue is not isolation. It is certainly not isolation. There is no way that we could, even if we wished to, isolate the largest, most populist nation in the world. 
It is, though, whether we as a country and we as a people are going to stand for something other than profits. 
That is what this amendment is about. That is why I believe, I have faith, that my colleagues in the Senate will support an amendment that really reflects the best not only of American values but human values. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. The officials that are listed of the various religious organizations that the Senator listed in the amendment are, in fact, Government employees, and Government agents. 
They are those at the head of these associations. These are the registered churches that are used as tools and the agents of the Chinese Communist Government in the repression of those various groups. It does not refer to the pastors, the ministers, the priests of local congregations, but the heads of these associations which, in fact, work for the Communist Chinese Government and are those that are perpetrating the very persecution against those groups. 
So while there are millions of Chinese today underground in unregistered churches, mosques, synagogues and temples, there is also the so-called Patriotic Church, the recognized church by the Government which is strictly controlled, names, addresses of worshipers to be turned into the Government. Messages that are proclaimed are closely censored by the Government. That is why those officials would be included if, in fact, the Secretary of State found credible evidence that they were practicing perpetrating religious persecution.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Colorado for his leadership on this appropriations bill, his leadership on tax reform in this Congress, and his support for the provision sunsetting the Tax Code. The amendment I will be offering on behalf of myself and Senator Brownback would sunset the entire Tax Code, December 31, 2002. I appreciate so much the Senator from Colorado in his cosponsorship of the original legislation that was introduced, and his support of this very, very important concept. 
I also point out to my colleagues, with my appreciation, the various organizations that have endorsed the scrapping of the code, the sunsetting, the terminating of the existing Tax Code. The Americans for Hope, Growth and Opportunity, the National Taxpayers Union, the National Federation of Independent Business, the American Conservative Union, Americans for Tax Reform, and Citizens for a Sound Economy have all lent their support for what I think is an essential step for all of us who believe the existing Tax Code does not work for the American people, and that the first step in replacing it with something that is simpler and something that is more fair and something that is less of a burden upon the American people would be to set a date certain in which we terminate and sunset the existing Tax Code. 
Congress recently took an important step to protect the American people from an overarching IRS. In the House, and in the Senate under the leadership of the distinguished Finance Committee chairman, Senator Roth, Congress passed the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act. Under this legislation, the burden of proof has now been shifted to the IRS. A newly restructured IRS will now be overseen by an independent panel, and I commend the work of the Senate Finance Committee and Chairman Roth for bringing this proposal to fruition. 
But this legislation, which I firmly supported, must not be the end of protecting the American taxpayer. On April 2, 1998, the Senate expressed itself on the need for fundamental change in passing an amendment to the budget resolution, not only to restructure the IRS but also to terminate and sunset the Federal Tax Code by the end of 2001. We passed that sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and we have a list of all of those who voted for that sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying we should sunset, we should set a date certain, and we should terminate the existing Tax Code. I invite all my colleagues in the Senate to look at that list of those who voted, on both sides of the aisle, on a bipartisan basis, to sunset the Tax Code. 
The House took a bold stride beyond this sense of the Senate in passing the Tax Code Termination Act on June 17, 1998. 
Today, the Senate has the opportunity to do the same. The amendment I, along with Senator Brownback and all of our cosponsors, have offered to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, that we will be calling up soon, would eliminate the Tax Code by December 31, 2002. Originally, way back last year, the original bill introduced would have sunset it back in the year 2000. Then there was an agreement among all the cosponsors to move that to December 31, 2001, to respond to those who said that is not enough time and the new Congress would not have enough time to enact comprehensive tax reform. 
Now, in the spirit of being as responsible as possible, and responding to, I think, the misguided and flawed allegations of the administration concerning Tax Code termination, we have moved that date to December 31, 2002. That allows us 4 1/2 years in order to write a new Tax Code. We say, in this amendment, that it should be in place July 4, prior to the sunset date. 
I know the Department of the Treasury, Mr. Rubin, has sent a letter out. Everybody, I am sure, will have seen this letter opposing this amendment, saying the President is going to veto this appropriations bill if the amendment is attached. It is not the first time that those kinds of threats have been made. It is, if you will read the letter, based upon misguided and flawed assumptions, making all kinds of assumptions as to what might be enacted or what might not be enacted at the time of the sunset date. 
So I believe what we are proposing is eminently responsible. So we need to join, I believe, the House of Representatives in passing this sunset date. It would allow the Social Security provisions, Medicare, and the Railroad Retirement Board to remain. But we would say the Congress, the President, the American people would replace the current Tax Code with a lean and honest system by no later than Independence Day, July 4, 2002. 
For too long, the American people have suffered under the chains of the oppressive regime we call our Federal Tax Code. It is just not enough to reform the IRS when the more fundamental problem is the Tax Code that we ask them to enforce. Each year, Americans spend over 5.4 billion hours slaving away to comply with tax provisions, the equivalent amount of time it takes to produce all of the cars in this country, all of the trucks in this country, to manufacture all of the airplanes in this country for a year. That is how much time we ask the American people to spend just trying to comply with complicated, arcane, and inexplicable tax provisions. A humble family of four will spend the equivalent of 2 weeks just for Tax Code compliance. 
Ironically, every year $13.7 billion of the money that taxpayers struggle to pay the Federal Government is spent enforcing tax laws, yet the IRS, the bureaucracy of 110,000 people in over 650 offices nationwide, provides misinformation one-fourth of the time taxpayers call to seek assistance. 
Not too long ago, Money magazine did, as they do every year, an interesting study. They found this: 45, the number of professional tax preparers who came up with different answers when asked by Money magazine, in 1997, to fill out a hypothetical family's 1996 tax return. That was the April 1997 edition of Money magazine. They found that 45 professional tax preparers, with the same information, came up with different answers on a hypothetical family's tax return. I think that is powerful evidence that we have a Tax Code that even the professionals cannot understand. 
They found also that the average hourly fee charged by professional tax preparers who came up with the 45 wrong answers is $81 an hour. That is what the American people are paying professional tax preparers who come up with the wrong answers time and time again. 
Mr. President, 6.4 million--that is the number of taxpayers who visited IRS customer service centers seeking answers to their tax questions in 1996. Over 6 million, according to the General Accounting Office, actually went to the IRS customer service centers seeking answers. 
Another figure, though, is 99 million, because it was 99 million taxpayers who called the IRS hotlines in 1996 seeking answers to questions about how they could comply with this complicated Tax Code; 99 million, one-fourth of them getting incorrect answers from the Internal Revenue Service. 
The Tax Code is not a stagnant creature. This code has mutated from its original form into an 800,000-word, 7,500-page monster preying on the American taxpayer. We in Congress are culpable for this feeding frenzy, for even in our attempts of incremental reform, even in our attempts to help the American taxpayer, we have made the Tax Code more complex. 
In 1997, Congress made serious attempts to ease the burdens of the American taxpayer. It was the first significant tax cut, I think, in 16 years. Yet, even in those efforts to provide tax relief, we unwittingly created new complications. I think everyone in this body would agree if we somehow could just start over and write a tax code, there is not one of us who would say, `Write the Tax Code the way we have it now,' because it has been a creation of these incremental changes made by special interest groups who had enough power to get that change enacted into law. 
We need to terminate, not complicate, the Tax Code. If you look at this chart, it says:  
The number of new sections in the Tax Code created by the 1997 Budget Act-- 
This was our Tax Relief Act--we created 285 new sections. 
The number of changes in the Tax Code accompanying the 1997 tax cut, 824, and the number of pages needed by the Research Institute of America to explain the changes in the tax law of 1997 was 3,132 pages. It was a lawyer's dream and tax accountant's dream when we passed that Tax Relief Act. 
While the American people were glad to receive some tax cuts --the $500-per-child tax cut, the change in the estate tax laws, change in the capital gains tax laws--the fact is, the great winners were the tax lawyers and the accountants--3,132 pages just to explain what we did in cutting taxes. 
The American people have called for this termination, this comprehensive reform of our tax laws. A recent poll that was conducted by the Americans for Hope, Growth and Opportunity discovered several things. In asking the question, `Do you approve or disapprove of a new Federal law to abolish the current tax system and require that a new Federal tax system be approved by Congress by July 4, 2001, and that this new system should then take effect 6 months after that date?' 
The response was 48.9 percent approved of that proposition, which we are going to be voting on, while only 24.1 percent disapproved. By a margin of 2 to 1, the American people are saying we ought to set a date certain. Six months prior to that date certain, we should have a new comprehensive fair tax system in place. 
The poll went ahead: `Do you approve or disapprove of a new Federal law to abolish the current tax system and require that a new Federal tax system be approved by Congress July 4, 2002?' 
Overwhelming support. 
They asked this question: `If you knew that Congress passed a law to create a new Federal Tax Code with the following specific principles: apply one low tax rate to all Americans; provide tax relief for working Americans; protect the rights of taxpayers and reduce tax collection abuses; eliminate bias against savings and investment; promote economic growth and job creation; and not penalize marriage or families--do you believe it is possible that Congress could accomplish these goals?' 
That was the question, and 57.3 percent of Americans answered yes, with 34.1 percent saying no, and 8.6 percent saying they did not know or refusing to answer. 
That is really quite remarkable, because what that response tells us is that the American people still have faith that their elected representatives can and should replace the current tax system with a simpler, fairer system. They think we can do it. 
Americans rapidly, though, I believe are reaching the level of outrage about this tax cut that would resemble even the kind of tax rebellion that occurred in the early days of this Republic in 1776. As an aside, I offer my own statistic. No official poll. No Gallup. No scientific sample. But I suggest this: That 100 percent of the people in this country and 100 Senators in this institution believe that an overhaul of the tax system is overdue and that it should occur. 
Mr. President, in the Senate today, we have three options before us--and I can't find another--we have these three options confronting every Senator in this body: We can ignore the plight of the American taxpayer and do nothing. That is what we have done for far too long. We have done nothing. We have passed resolutions. We have passed sense of the Senates. We have made speeches, and we have debated. We have introduced bills, and we have even passed tax cuts that further complicated the Tax Code. But in the end, what we have really done about comprehensive tax reform is nothing. 
Tonight we have that option before us. We can continue to do nothing. We can vote down this amendment to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, or we can move to table it when it is offered, and we can go down the path of defending the status quo. I suspect there will be a lot of my colleagues who will make that choice tonight. 
Or we can implement incremental reforms and try our best to make repairs to a house built on shifting sand as we have almost every year for the last 12 years. In fact, one study found that since 1913, since the institution of the income tax, we have added about 100 pages to the Tax Code every year; on average, 100 pages are added to the Tax Code. 
We can continue to do that. We can continue to make small incremental changes in this complicated Tax Code and hope that somehow we are able to repair this house that is built on shifting sand. I do not believe that is a viable option. 
This is the third thing we can do: We can lay a solid foundation for a new house by voting for real reform, the termination of the current Tax Code. I believe the choice is clear. 
Secretary Rubin, President Clinton and other critics of this proposal will say that sunsetting is reckless. I suggest that when the opponents of this rise to oppose this amendment, that is what we are going to hear: `This is a reckless proposal.' We will hear it over and over. 
They have characterized it as irresponsible, reckless, certain to cause uncertainty. The President wants to pretend that sunsetting provisions are somehow unusual, somehow irresponsible. They are neither. He would have us believe they create paralyzing uncertainty, and yet if you will look at the sunset provisions that we have in law, all major spending legislation is sunsetted. We recently debated legislation to replace both the Higher Education Act and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, the ISTEA bill, both of which expired this year due to sunset provisions included in the original legislation. All major spending legislation contains sunsetting provisions. Sunsetting forces Congress to periodically review the merits, effectiveness and efficiency of the programs it creates. Only then can these programs be continued. 
In testimony before Congress, Alan Greenspan expressed his support for the concept of sunsetting. He is the guru, many believe, of the unprecedented period of economic expansion, but he said he believed that everything in Government should face these sunset provisions. 
The President has said he believes sunsetting will cause instability. I believe we are going to hear that. He imagines that the current tax system is somehow stable. The truth is, the current Tax Code is riddled with uncertainty. 
The only certainty in this system is that it will become more complex through incremental reform and that special interests will thread their way through these special loopholes. 
To my colleagues who say this is going to create uncertainty, this is my response: If you believe that we need to get from where we are to a simpler, fairer tax system, there is no way, I suggest, to get from where we are to where we all want to be without some degree of uncertainty. You cannot replace this entire Tax Code, no matter how incremental you may do it, over a long period of time without there being certain uncertainties in markets or business planning or whatever. 
But I suggest what Senator Brownback and myself have proposed is the most rational way to get from where we are to comprehensive tax reform. Because we allow 4 1/2 years, we set a date certain, we ensure that there are going to be proper oversight hearings by the Finance Committee, that all of the various proposals that have been submitted will have ample time for debate, and that the American people and the American business community will have adequate time to plan for the changes that will be enacted. 
I would assume that those changes would be phased in over a period of years as well. But what we have proposed is eminently responsible, not going to create uncertainty, and is not reckless. It is only those who want to defend the status quo, I believe, who throw out those kinds of arguments. 
I have a number of other points I would like to make, and perhaps as the debate goes on I will have an opportunity to do that. I know there are a number of others who are cosponsors of this legislation who will be wanting to seek recognition. 
Senator Warner has requested a period of time to discuss the Capitol security program and the new visitor center. I know that is something that is heavy on all of our minds today. And Senator Brownback is certainly willing to postpone his comments. 
At this point I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, like Senator Lott, our majority leader, I am most reluctant to offer this amendment in opposition to the sentiments of the chairman of the Finance Committee. Likewise, I have the utmost respect for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I want to respond to a couple of things they said, my colleague from Wisconsin and my colleague from New Jersey, who, to me, when they talk about this proposal being something radical, what I hear in response is the politics of fear. 
They say, `Well, we're not going to have a code, we're not going to have a Tax Code.' And then, `We are not going to have the FDA, we're not going to have FAA, we're not going to have roads, we're not going to have Social Security.' 
By the way, Social Security is omitted entirely from this bill. It is not even a factor. But we hear the politics of fear--the sky is falling. 
Let me assure my colleagues, there is nothing as certain as the Sun rising in the morning but that this Senate will have a Tax Code come 2002. I assure you that this Senate and this House will not allow this Government to go without revenue. 
My goodness, if you love this Tax Code so much and you like the loopholes and you like the deductions and you like the exemptions and you like the exclusions so much, then you can propose that we reenact this Tax Code in total just like it is, and there you go. You go back and defend that before the American people because that, I say to my colleagues, is exactly what this debate is all about: Do you defend the status quo, or do you want change? 
Senator Roth--and I love this man. I respect him like my father, and I think he has done marvelous work in so many areas in the IRS. But I pose only this question to him and to all others who disagree with this amendment: How long? The fear that we are not going to have it enacted--here is the time line: 4 1/2 years of national debate, and if we can't get it done in 4 1/2 years, then we can reenact this wonderful Tax Code that those on the other side or those who oppose this would like to defend. Four and a half years of national debate. Long enough--long enough--to wait for tax reform. 
July 1998, that is where we are now. Come November, we will have a congressional election; November 2000, we will have a Presidential election; July 4, 2002, we suggest in this amendment that we should have a new code approved; November 2002, more congressional elections before we finally reach December 31, 2002, the sunset date. 
I suggest that is long enough. Let's give the American people what they are demanding, and that is a Tax Code that is fairer and simpler and friendlier.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I respond to the Senator, the whole point in having the sunset date is to force us into a national debate to decide the very question he poses. If I might continue, to argue the debate on what the pros and cons are on a sales tax, flat tax, I would just say, you can't do worse than what we have. 
If you reach that point that you want to reenact this code, this amendment allows you to do that. I suggest that we can and we must do much better. And it would be putting the cart before the horse to say, `This is what we must do.' What we need to do is set the date forcing us to reach that consensus on what should replace the current code.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I, first of all, do not know to which study the Senator is referring. There are many studies on the various rates of a flat and sales tax. But what I would suggest is that the principles laid down in the bill that I introduced and in the amendment that we are debating would be violated by any type of a 30-percent aggressive sales tax. Obviously, that would be something that I think would be totally unacceptable. 
But to throw up these fears: `We're going to lose a home mortgage deduction' and `We're going to lose a charitable deduction,' that is the politics of fear. That is what prevents us from moving forward to real and comprehensive tax reform, in my opinion.

That is the whole point, I say to my colleague. The whole point that we need a deadline is to move us to reach the consensus on what is the best way. I suspect we will end up keeping a home mortgage deduction and the charitable deduction. But we need that national debate. The only way we are going to force that national debate is to focus--most Americans are exactly where I am. They are not sure what would be the best replacement. But they sure know this: What we have needs to be replaced.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, before I raise my concerns about this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, I pay my respects and my thanks to the Senator from Iowa for his leadership and his advocacy for agriculture, as well as the Senator from Kansas, who is presiding at this time, for his many years of service to agriculture and service to our country as a proponent and advocate for the agriculture community. I think that the intent of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution is admirable. It has many very laudable provisions. Certainly, I am a proponent of fast track. We need to give the President fast-track authority. I regret that President Clinton has expressed his unwillingness to pursue that aggressively in the House of Representatives, and I applaud the Speaker of the House for scheduling a vote in September on fast-track authority. 
I believe the votes are there to pass fast-track authority in the Senate, and I hope we have the opportunity to do that. I hope we have more than sense of the Senate. I hope we will, in fact, have the opportunity to give the President that negotiating authority, which I believe will be an important step in opening markets for the agriculture community. I am glad that we have a sense of the Senate that has that provision in it. 
I also applaud the provisions regarding sanctions reform. I believe very strongly that we misuse the sanctions tool. Sanctions is not a policy; sanctions is a tool, and it is a tool that we should not abandon. We have only three great tools: one is military, one is economic, and one is diplomatic. We need all three of them, and it would be a mistake for us to make a wholesale abandonment of the use of sanctions in dealing with other nations. It would make the use of military force a greater likelihood, and that would be a mistake. 
There is no doubt we need to reform sanctions laws in this country, and I am glad to be serving on the leader's bipartisan task force to bring about comprehensive reform of the sanctions laws. It is important, and the leader has said by September 1, we should try to produce comprehensive reform of the sanctions in this country. I don't know that we will make the September 1 deadline, but it is a mistake for us to prematurely begin to make those kinds of reforms incrementally. I think we should wait for a comprehensive approach to sanctions reform, but I am glad to support the sense of the Senate that advocates that we reform the sanctions. 
My concern about this resolution, nonbinding though it is, is that there is a provision included that would put us on record in support of extending most-favored-nation status to China. Next week, the House of Representatives will begin what I think will be a heated and intense debate on whether we should, once again, provide most-favored-nation trading status to the People's Republic of China. For the U.S. Senate, 1 week before the House begins its debate, to have, in a sense of the Senate, one little provision that says, `Yes, we should extend MFN and, in fact, extend MFN permanently to China,' would be a great mistake. I regret that the authors of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution saw fit to include that one provision which I think, more than any other provision in this resolution, becomes controversial. 
This week there was a headline in the Washington Post that said this: `Chinese Resume Arrests.' 
Mr. President, perhaps nothing is more prophetic or revealing about the lack of impact the President's recent trip will have on the future of democracy in China than this week's headlines announcing a multitude of new arrests of political dissidents in China. 
Less than 1 week after the President of the United States ended his tour of China, Chinese police arrested 10 prodemocracy advocates in China. I will read the first paragraph in that Post article, dated July 12, Beijing:  
Police detained 10 democracy advocates just one week after President Clinton ended a tour of China, during which he emphasized the benefits of freedom and the rule of law, and praised Chinese President Jiang Zemin as a man who could transform this nation into a modern democracy. 
The detainees included two cofounders of the opposition China Democratic Party, who tried to register it on June 25, the day Clinton began his nine-day visit. 
These people were arrested for one reason: They dared to start an opposition party to the Communist Party in China. For daring to say we will be an opposition voice, for daring to say we will dissent from the ruling political party in China, they were arrested. 
I asked an advocate of MFN today, a Member of the House of Representatives who is a proponent of MFN, `Sir, what would it take for you to vote against normal trading status with China? What would they have to do? What abuse would they have to perpetrate in order for you to cast a vote against MFN?' 
There was a thoughtful response, and I think a cause for pause. I ask all those who say we need to adopt a sense-of-the-Senate resolution today advocating MFN for China to ask themselves the question: What would it take? Is it forced abortion? Apparently not. So a nation that continues to practice taking women who are 7, 8 and 9 months pregnant against their will forcibly to a labor camp, putting them in a cell and forcing them against their will to have an abortion, if that is not enough to deny normal trading status or MFN, what does it take? 
China today continues to persecute religious minorities, whether they are Hindus, whether they are Buddhists or whether they are Evangelical Christians, they continue to incarcerate them, they continue to require registration, they continue to monitor the messages. 
If religious persecution is not enough to deny MFN for China, what does it take? What would they have to do? China continues to proliferate weapons of mass destruction. In committee testimony this week, officials of this Government admitted they cannot guarantee that China is not today continuing to proliferate. So if the proliferation of missiles and weapons technology is not enough to deny MFN, what does it take? What would it require that we say no to giving them normal trading status? 
For us to go on record in light of the ongoing abuses--what a thumb in the eye to the U.S. Senate and to the United States of America and to the President of this country, within 1 week of our President's visit, to round up those who dare to say, `We would like to be an opposition political party,' and who dare to call their political party the Democracy Party. They rounded them up and put them in jail. How ironic that the President would refer to, and I quote the President's words in his speech in China, what he called `a steady breeze of freedom blowing through China.' 
That gentle breeze has become a brittle wind chilling any hope for true freedom--freedom of speech, freedom of political expression, freedom of religion in this Communist nation. 
So while there were dazzling pictures and eloquent rhetoric about human rights, the President's tour of China was full of missed opportunities and mistakes that are sure to have a much more detrimental impact on human rights in China in the long run than the benefit of any short-term afterglow. 
I will not today itemize what I think were the missed opportunities during the President's trip to China. But there is one--there is one--certainty, that on the heels of that trip, the Chinese Government once again cracked down on those who would make the mildest of political dissent and seek to register as a new political party. 
Any pretense that the government, the regime, that dominates China today is moving toward reform and democracy should have been dispelled by what they did this week. And for the U.S. Senate to say, we are going on record in favor of most-favored-nation status, in view of what they did, I think would be a great mistake. 
I would welcome the opportunity for the sponsors of this amendment to simply take the MFN provision out of this sense of the Senate; and I would wholeheartedly support it. But I think it is a mistake for us to go on that kind of record in view of what China has done in the wake of the President's recent trip in which he spoke so eloquently for freedom and for democracy. 
I add, to my colleagues in the Senate, that it was this week that the Communist government in China rebuked the U.S. Senate for our audacity in passing a resolution reaffirming our traditional support for Taiwan. 
I believe the President made mistakes in his trip to China, and I could enumerate them. But the greatest mistake was this: pinning our hopes for democratic reform in China to this regime. And the laudatory comments made about Jiang Zemin and the expression of the belief that he would be the leader to move in a transition from the current totalitarianism and repression to democracy and freedom, that hope was surely dashed in the actions of the Chinese Government this week. 
I ask my colleagues to think again. I ask my distinguished colleague from Iowa, whom I admire and respect so much, to rethink the inclusion of a pro-MFN statement in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to the Harkin amendment. I commend our chairman for the outstanding leadership on this legislation, but I have concerns on the impact of this legislation, what it would do to making student loans accessible to millions of our students. 
At the core of making higher education affordable and accessible are two programs we have heard much about: The Federal Family Education Loan Program, or FFEL Program, which, through public-private partnership, has successfully provided loans to millions of students since 1965. The second program is the Direct Student Loan Program, a program initiated by President Clinton, and a program I think designed to make the Department of Education the largest student lender in the country. In fact, there are currently 36 active State and private nonprofit guaranty agencies, including the Student Loan Guarantee Foundation of Arkansas. 
These guaranty foundations work closely with students, with families, with schools, and lenders to process loans, prevent loans from going into default, and pay claims on and collect on those loans that do default as a part of the traditional Guaranteed Student Loan Program, the FFEL Program. 
Over the past 33 years, FFELP student loan providers have reliably delivered more than 92 million loans totaling $245 billion. Two-thirds of all student loans are provided by the private sector via the FFEL Program. 
FFELP is cost effective for the Government, and the competitive environment spurs FFELP innovation and high-quality service. Reducing student loan original fees--which this amendment does not do--reducing student loan origination fees which are paid by students to the Department of Education, I believe, is a laudable goal, something we need to study and something we may do, but the amendment we are debating, the Harkin amendment, does not reduce the 3 percent origination fee paid by students in the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. Rather, it eliminates the 1 percent insurance program, also called the guaranty fee. 
It is interesting, when you are against something, you call it a tax. And this fee has tonight been called a tax. Suddenly, we are voting for a tax decrease, a tax cut. But this guaranty fee has, in fact, preceded even the nationalizing of this loan program. It goes all the way back to 1965. This was not enacted as a temporary measure because of economic conditions. The original fee, in fact, was, but we are not dealing with the original fee, we are dealing with the guaranty fee, the insurance premium fee. That is what the amendment would do this evening. 
That serves as the primary source of revenue to guarantors, intended to help offset the risk of default on student loans. Without the insurance premium coming in on the new guaranteed loans, guaranty agencies will have insufficient funds in their Federal reserve fund to pay lender claims on defaulted loans. Many of them will for sure. In fact, losing the 1 percent insurance fee equates to approximately 40 percent of revenue for the Student Loan Guaranty Foundation in my home State of Arkansas. 
I believe--I think I am correct in this--that of all the institutions of higher learning in Arkansas, there is only one currently using the direct lending program. All the rest have opted to continue in the FFEL Program, and we seriously jeopardize the guaranty foundation with the Harkin amendment; therefore, we jeopardize the accessibility of student loans to hundreds of thousands of students who are going to need those loans now and in the future. 
With less money in their reserve to process loans and pay lender claims on defaulted loans, the Arkansas guaranty agency could be forced out of business in less than 2 years. So I say to the competition, which has been lauded as being such a good thing, such a meritorious thing, it would be eliminated as the bias is made toward direct student lending, and the FFEL Program which has served my State so well would be jeopardized. 
Madam President, the Harkin amendment, I believe sincerely, is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It would essentially kill the guaranteed loan program by driving guaranty agencies out of business. If schools really wanted to be in the Direct Loan Program, then over 80 percent of them would not have chosen to remain in the guaranteed loan program, which I believe we threaten by this amendment. 
I urge my colleagues to support the loan program, which provides private capital and servicing for nearly two-thirds of all Federal student loans, and do so by opposing the Harkin amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. If I might respond, if I understand what you have just read from the law, that while that ensures the fact the Federal Government is the ultimate guarantor, that that only occurs when the guaranty foundation, the guaranty agency, has faced solvency, and that is my very concern. 
Yes, while there may be an ultimate protection, before that ultimate protection is realized, the agencies that have served our students so well would, in fact, face insolvency. That is my concern for the State of Arkansas; that is my concern for the students of Arkansas.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. If I might just conclude, we can stand here and debate and have a colloquy over the numbers you presented. I cannot and would not question the numbers you presented my colleagues, so I will not speak on the aggregate that you presented. But I will say that while you are dealing with the aggregate, you are not speaking to the specific circumstances and situations of guaranty foundations across the country. I only know in particular how it would impact the Arkansas Guaranty Foundation, which has served our State well, and I believe that the numbers in Arkansas reflect that it, in fact, could face insolvency in a matter of years should the Harkin amendment be adopted. And that is the basis of my very sincere and very strong opposition.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. They have lost $1.1 million without the Harkin amendment in the reserve fund. So, Madam President, I would say, once again, my concern is for the students of Arkansas, that they have a competitive environment for student loans. I believe that will not continue if the Harkin amendment is adopted and that, in fact, the end result, intended or otherwise, will be to force institutions into direct student lending, which I do not think is in the best interest of the students of my State or this country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act. I want to take this opportunity to commend Senator Roth for the outstanding work he has done on this legislation. As a new Senator, I was impressed with the hearings that Senator Roth conducted and which have galvanized this institution to move on something that was a compelling need. They were dramatic hearings not because they were highly choreographed or because there was sophisticated promotion; they were dramatic because of the impact and the gripping nature of the stories that were told to the committee and to the American people. 
I think our country and this institution owe a great debt of gratitude to the Senator from Delaware for the role that he has played in calling the attention of the American people to the abuses. It became evident during the course of both sets of hearings that these stories were not isolated incidents but were all too typical, as we found from the response of the American people in calling our offices all over Capitol Hill about similar incidents that had occurred. 
I want to take just a moment to praise my predecessor in the U.S. Senate, the former senior Senator from Arkansas, Senator Pryor. Senator Reid spoke of his role in taxpayer rights in the past. I think that the work Senator Pryor did as a Senator from Arkansas has helped to lay the groundwork for the step that we are taking as a body today. I want to express my appreciation on behalf of the people of Arkansas and on behalf of taxpayers across this country for Senator Pryor's unfailing efforts and untiring efforts to provide protections for the taxpayers of this country. And although the Taxpayer Bill of Rights was not the ultimate solution, and the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2 was not signed into law, it helped to call our attention to it and to galvanize the American people to push for this action. I want to pay my highest regards to Senator Pryor, who I know is pleased with the action that the U.S. Senate is taking today. 
I think the protection provisions in this legislation will take a big step toward assuring the American people that we are 
still on their side and that the tax system of this country is not stacked against them. We should remind ourselves of the things that this does not do. It would be, I think, a shame if this legislation were to be the release on the pressure that has built up over the years to demand comprehensive tax reform. This is an essential step, and it moves the ball in the right direction. It does not simplify the code. The code is still a labyrinth of confusion, incomprehensible to many people, tax preparers, and to many in the IRS themselves. It does not provide the lower rates the American people deserve, and it does not eliminate inequities in the code, like the marriage penalty and the exorbitant estate tax rates. I know Senator Roth will continue to push for comprehensive tax reform for the taxpayers of this country. 
I believe that one way we can do that is to set a sunset date, a date certain in which this Tax Code will be eliminated and we will require ourselves to take action in providing comprehensive tax reform, a lower tax rate, a fairer Tax Code for the American people. We may disagree on that, but it is imperative that this be one more step in moving toward what is essential, which is comprehensive tax reform for the American people. 
I will conclude with a statement that President Clinton made during his recent trip to China, in which he addressed the students at Beijing University and spoke to them about the nature of freedom, about our heritage of freedom in this country. I believe that what he said--and said eloquently--applies to the ongoing debate about IRS reform and restructuring and making the Tax Code of this country fairer for the American people. He said:  
In America, we tend to view freedom as the freedom from Government abuse or from Government control. That is our heritage. Our founders came here to escape the monarchy in England. 
Then he said this: 
Sometimes freedom requires affirmative steps by Government. 
I simply say that this legislation, which Senator Roth has led the way on, is an affirmative step that this Government must take to ensure that the American people truly enjoy the fruits of freedom, which is our legacy and heritage. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bumpers amendment, and I join him in his 8th year of travail on what I think has been an important provision. When I came to Congress in 1993, I came with great alarm about the cost overruns, the delays, the projected increases in spending, and what appeared to be a black hole absorbing precious taxpayer dollars. I also came with a willingness to be convinced that was going to change. I was promised that they were going to tighten their belts, slim it down and trim it down, that it was going to become a responsible kind of program and project. Well, the most recent GAO report--the 1998 GAO report--has convinced me that we need to cut our losses, that it is not going to happen, that it has not happened and, in fact, the projections are that we are going to continue to see exorbitant cost increases if we continue down the road of building the space station. 
My colleague from Maryland spoke much of the value of microgravity and the need for the space station and microgravity research. I would like to quote Professor Robert Park of the Department of Physics at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. Doctor Park said: 
Microgravity is the only unique property of a space station environment, and the station was originally envisioned as a sort of microgravity R&D laboratory. The microgravity research that was envisioned for the international space station has already been largely completed, either on the shuttle or on Mir. 
So there you have it. The original and primary justification for building the space station has largely been realized by ongoing R&D, either on the shuttle or on Mir. 
By cutting the international space station's lifeline, today the Senate has the opportunity to save billions of dollars that have been floating away now for over a decade. I want to commend Senator Bumpers for his resolve, for his eloquence, and for his persistence on this issue. My distinguished colleague from Maryland said that in appreciation for Senator Bumpers' efforts, he had turned on the yellow light. I can only say that what we need to do is turn on the red light on this project. It needs to be a stop light. 
From fiscal year 1985 to fiscal year 1997, it has already cost the American people $19 billion. In its current form, the Senate appropriations bill would pour another $2.3 billion into this project. My distinguished colleague from Arkansas has offered an amendment to the VA-HUD appropriations bill which would end this cycle of waste. The Bumpers amendment would provide $850 million for the termination of the International Space Station, make $450 million available to HUD, and most important, redirect $1 billion of the savings from the space 
station and make that money available to the Veterans' Health Administration medical care account. 
Since its inception, the International Space Station has become a looming monstrosity of skyrocketing costs and scientific indefensibility. According to the latest GAO estimate, this will now cost the American taxpayers $96 billion. That is up $2 billion from 1995--only 3 years ago. This enormous figure includes the costs of design, construction, launching, and 10 years of operation, but it does not include future schedule slippage, additional shuttle launches to test the crew return vehicle, deconstruction at the end of the station's life, as well as possible delays by our partners on their obligations to the project. With these additional factors, the space station will undoubtedly take several more years and several billion more taxpayer dollars. It is a record we have seen time after time on the space station. 
Costs have been increasing steadily. So far, the American people have paid $19 billion into the project. Since the space station was conceived, cost estimates have risen dramatically. Under the original space station concept, space station Freedom, the Reagan administration estimated a cost of $8 billion in 1983. NASA's estimate rose to $16 billion by 1987. By 1993, the cost of developing and building the space station Freedom rose to $30 billion, with an additional $60 billion for 30 years of operation. In the same year, the GAO estimated a grand total of $118 billion for all space station costs, including launches. Now, under the revised concept of the International Space Station, NASA estimated $72 billion in costs, including 10 years of operations and shuttle costs. Those are a lot of figures. What is the American taxpayer to think? What are they to believe? 
In the past 3 years, the GAO's cost estimate for the station has increased by $1.7 billion. You can believe that. From $93.9 billion in June of 1995 to $95.6 billion in April of 1998. Why have the costs increased? According to Allen Li, Associate Director of Defense Acquisitions at the GAO, during his June 24, 1998, testimony before the House Science Committee, there are a number of factors why that happened.  
The higher development costs--$21.9 billion [1998] versus $17.4 billion [1995]--are attributable to schedule delays, additional prime contractor effort, not covered by funding reserves, additional crew return vehicle costs, and costs incurred as a result of delays in the Russian-made Service Module. 
My colleague spoke eloquently about Russia's role in the space station and their delays in the cost overruns, and the fact that they simply are not capable of bearing their share of this burden. 
In other words, schedule delays and increased shuttle flights have driven costs up dramatically. Unfortunately, these delays are not new to the space station project. Phase II of the project, which involves construction of a U.S.-Russian space station that can be permanently occupied by three astronauts, was originally scheduled to occur from 1997 to 1998. NASA pushed phase II to occur from 1998 to 2000. Phase III, which involves additional construction, including the addition of European, Japanese and Canadian components, has been postponed from 1998 through 2002 to the years 2000 through 2004. The first launch for phase II was originally scheduled for November of 1997, later postponed to June of 1998, and is now scheduled for November of 1998. The completion date for the station, originally scheduled for June of 2002, then 2003, is now scheduled for January of 2004. On and on we could go with these delays. 
Clearly, delays and launches are likely to increase, driving costs even to newer heights. There is much that I would like to say. When I came up here, NASA lobbied me hard, telling me that though there had been mistakes and there had been cost overruns, they were going to tighten their belt, that it was going to be a new kind of project with a new kind of fiscal austerity. I believe that the GAO report, in addition to the cost assessment and validation task force that gave a similar report, provides compelling evidence that NASA is not capable or is unwilling to make those kinds of tough decisions. This is a project it is time to end. 
I remember all of the eloquent arguments that my colleague from the House side from the State of Texas made in defense of the Super Collider. `We have to have the Super Collider.' Almost every argument I heard today was made in defense of the Super Collider and the benefits, the spinoff benefits, we were going to receive in society. Congress made a tough decision that it could be better used in other forms of scientific research, and we cut our losses. 
I cite the Cost Assessment and Validation Task Force established by NASA in September 1997 to independently review and assess the cost schedules and performance schedules on the International Space Station. That was led by Mr. Jay Chabrow. They issued a report this past April. This is what they said. The most optimistic estimate of the cost growth for the space station was over $2.195 billion. The most pessimistic estimate was $7.5 billion. It estimated that it will take 2 years longer to assemble the space station, pushing the completion date to 2006. Personnel requirements spiral from 1,285 originally predicted, to over 2,000. 
I would say to my conservative friends on the Republican side of the aisle that we were not sent up here to build up more government. We were not sent up here to support projects that are good sounding, that have noble objectives, but have a track record of wasting taxpayer dollars. That is not why we were sent up here. That is the record of this project. If we just step back and set aside our conservative Republican prejudices on this issue, and ask if it were any other project, would we defend it; were it any other project with these kind of cost overruns, delays, and wasteful spending record, would we defend it? I would suggest to you we would not. But this is our little baby that we are going to protect at all costs regardless of how much taxpayer dollars it wastes. We were not sent up to float a barrel of pork in outer space. 
I want to say one other thing before I end my remarks. We go from the extraterrestrial to the terrestrial, because I think it is good that we are taking $1 billion of what is being wasted on this project and putting it toward veterans health care. 
There are 26 million veterans in this country. We hear from them. We hear of the waiting lines. We have 173 hospitals, and we have not built a new one in a long, long time. We are rightly moving to outpatient care. We cannot open enough clinics for veterans. We cannot make health care accessible enough. The average age of veterans is increasing, necessitating more frequent care and longer convalescence. These are going to be greater needs as the World War II generation of veterans faces greater and greater health care needs. The increased demand in care strains the resources of VA medical facilities. Many of them have to drive many miles to get health care. High-quality medical personnel shy away from VA hospitals because they find them less appealing and less lucrative. Nurse practitioners rather than doctors have become the norm in many VA facilities. 
This is an opportunity for us to do a service to this country by stopping a program that needs to be stopped. This is not--and I emphasize this is not--an antiscience, an antitechnology vote. NASA will continue to have over $11 billion in fiscal year 1999. This is a protechnology Congress. We consistently voted for increased funding for NIH and NAS, the National Academy of Sciences. This is not an antiscience and antitechnology vote. It is a vote to say here is one area that 
has been so egregious in wasteful spending that we draw the line, we cut our losses, we stop the bleeding, and we are going to take those savings and put it in where we know it is going to be an investment in human beings in VA health care. 
Michael Daly, a seventh grader from Sherwood, AR, wrote me a letter asking me the value of a future in the military. Do you know what that young seventh grader is thinking about? He is thinking not only about our commitment to our Armed Forces, but how well we are going to meet our commitment to our men and women who have served as they leave the armed services and as they become the veterans of this country. Are we going to remember them? 
This is an opportunity for us to do a twin service to our veterans and to the taxpayers of this country in stopping an indefensible wasteful spending program. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Bumpers, who has been sometimes a lonely voice in pointing to the catastrophic waste in the space station, and join us in ending that program this year and support our veterans at the same time. 
I thank my colleague from Arkansas for yielding me this time.

<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes about that amendment which I authored and which I anticipate Senator Warner will move, at 10:15, to table. 
It has become evident to me that tabling motions in this institution at one time were far more meaningful; that in this case there will be an effort to vote against tabling, simply for the purpose of making that vote meaningless. There are those who simply do not want a straight up or down, clean vote on the substance of these amendments. What they want to do is cease embarrassing themselves by being seen voting against amendments that are supported broadly by the American people and are substantively what we ought to do: condemn forced abortion, deny visas to those who are performing them, condemn religious persecution, deny visas to those who are involved in it. Those are the kinds of things the American people support. But those who simply want to avoid having to cast that vote at this time are going to vote against tabling it and, by so doing, prevent any kind of clean up or down vote on the substance of these amendments. 
There is no time agreement. We will have a cloture vote later today. So they seem to have found a means by which, on a parliamentary basis, they can avoid having to take a stand on what we need to be taking a stand about. 
They will argue this is the wrong time; we should not do this on the eve of the President's departure for China. I would simply say, this amendment, really four amendments that have been now wedded together, this amendment strengthens the hand of our President as he goes to China. It gives him greater voice and it gives him a greater tool as both the House and the Senate will then have been on record on the substance of these amendments. The President will be able to express to the Chinese people, with the full backing of Congress, his deep concern about these issues. 
How important this is, and how much progress still needs to be made in China, was very evident today by the headline in the Washington Times. The headline in the Washington Times this morning is: `Beijing Pulls Visas of Three U.S. Reporters: Move Targets Radio Free Asia.' 
In a move that is absolutely astounding, it shows that China simply doesn't get it. In a move that reflects the fact that they simply don't understand what freedom and liberty and a free press is all about, they have denied visas to three reporters previously approved by this administration to travel to China and to cover the events of the President's visit. 
I have learned to appreciate more and more Radio Free Asia and the outstanding work they do and the outstanding job they perform and the outstanding coverage that they provide. Now we find that these three reporters are going to be denied the opportunity to go. The Chinese Government has refused to give them permission to come because--why? Because, apparently, they are afraid that some of that coverage might put the Beijing government in a poor light. 
As I mentioned yesterday, in my remarks on the floor, Newsweek magazine chose this edition, on the eve of the 
President's trip, to highlight the new China. In fact, the cover article is headlined, `The New China.' I would only quote one portion of the article:  
In large measure, the central question surrounding Clinton's trip is whether China has really changed since 1989. 
Walking around the glittering shopping malls of Beijing, talking to the members of the newly affluent Chinese middle class, it is plain that China is not the country it was 9 years ago. Official language has changed; China's leaders no longer deny what happened in Tiananmen Square, but focus on what has happened since--an embrace of market economics and new political and legal rights. More important, on the streets and in the media, `unofficial' China is giving real shape to such rights. 
I will repeat that last sentence, `Unofficial China is giving real shape to such rights,' political and legal rights, that is. 
The question before this Senate is what is official China doing? And it is obvious from the headline in the Washington Times today, the story that they broke, that Beijing pulled the visas of three U.S. reporters, indicates what official China is doing today is yet, still, very deplorable. 
In the State Department report on China for 1997, the human rights report on China, they have section 2, dealing with respect for civil liberties. In particular, they address this issue of a free press and our State Department's report says: 
There are 10,000 openly distributed publications in China, including 2,200 newspapers. During the year, the Central Propaganda Department instructed all provinces and municipalities to set up a special team to review publications. 
Now listen: 
All media employees are under explicit, public orders to follow [Chinese Communist Party] directives and `guide public opinion' as directed by political authorities. Both formal and informal guidelines continue to require reporters to avoid coverage of sensitive subjects and negative news. Journalists also must protect State secrets in accordance with State Security Law. These public orders, guidelines, and laws greatly restrict the freedom of broadcast journalists and newspapers to report the news and leads to a high degree of self-censorship. In October leading dailies in China carried a translation of a major policy speech by a foreign official; however, a lengthy section on human rights was dropped from the translation. 
I believe our State Department report on human rights conditions in China once again reflects very clearly how far China has to go and how deplorable civil rights and human rights conditions in China really are. And in the particular area of freedom of speech and press, we find there is a very, very rigid censorship that controls the media in China. 
Nowhere was that censorship more evident than in Beijing's decision to pull the visas of these U.S. reporters seeking to provide coverage on the President's trip. I urge all of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to read in its entirety the China Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1997. It is in fact, I believe, a great eye-opener and deals not only with the area of the press, but deals with the issues of forced abortions and religious persecution which the amendment that is pending before this body deals with explicitly. 
Mr. President, as we will be voting on this motion to table at 10:15 today, and we think about the issue of forced abortions, I have heard in recent days China apologists explain that really what is going on in China isn't all that bad. And the defense goes something like this: China's official family policy, family planning policy, forbids coercion; it forbids forced abortions or forced sterilizations. They will say that is the official position of the Chinese Government. The problem is, that has never been codified. It has never been written down. 
So while the Beijing authorities will say, `Yes, we do not tolerate forced abortions or coercion in family planning practices,' that has never been codified and put into the law of the land in China. 
The Chinese Government will acknowledge that local officials, under great pressure to meet population targets, sometimes utilize these coercive practices. So while they will argue this is not the public policy of China to permit coerced abortions, they will acknowledge, because such targets are placed and such financial incentives are placed over local officials, that local officials sometimes go over the edge and will use these coercive practices in enforcing the one-child policy in China. 
In defense of the fact that these practices are tolerated, China will explain that it is a very large country, and it is simply impossible for the central Government to maintain and punish those who break the official ban on coercive family planning practices. That is the rationale that is given. China apologists, of which there are many in this country, will say, `We have to be understanding. They don't officially permit this. It's local officials who get out of hand. And, after all, China is a big country. We can't expect they're going to be able to enforce this consistently.' 
When I hear that rationale, what I immediately think of is the fact that, according to our State Department report, every known dissident in China has been rounded up and incarcerated. Somehow the central Chinese Government manages to monitor and find those who might speak out for human rights or for democracy or for freedom in China today. The central Government has no problem in enforcing their very rigid control of the population. And yet they want to excuse themselves from any kind of enforcement in preventing coerced family planning practices in China. 
If the one-child policy results in pressure for local officials to engage in force, then the central Government ought to change that central Government policy and simply remove the kinds of incentives that have resulted from local officials coercing women to have abortions when they do not want to. If, according to our State Department, all dissidents have been silenced, then surely the central Government that can monitor democracy dissidents all over the vast country can surely monitor and control rogue officials who practice these very horrendous procedures on unwilling women in China. 
The Chinese authorities, in 1979, instituted the policy of allowing one child per couple, providing monetary bonuses and other benefits as incentives for that one-child policy. In subsequent years, it has been widely reported that women with one living child, who become pregnant a second time, are subjected to rigorous pressure to end the pregnancies and undergo sterilization. 
Forced abortions and sterilization, Mr. President, have not only been used in Communist China to regulate the number of children, but to eliminate those regarded as `defective' under China's very inhumane eugenics policy. They call their law the natal and health care law. What a misnomer. This law requires couples at risk of transmitting disabling congenital defects to their children to use birth control or undergo forced sterilization. 
China currently has legislation that requires women to be sterilized after conceiving two children, and they even go so far as to demand sterilization of either the man or the woman if traces of a serious hereditary disease is found in an effort to eliminate the presence of children with handicaps, to eliminate the presence of children with illnesses or other characteristics they might consider to be `abnormal.' That eugenics policy is 
abhorrent and it is morally reprehensible. It is the practice, it is the law of the land in China today. 
The amendment that is before us would address this issue. It would put us on record in condemning this practice and be at least a symbolic step in denying visas to those for whom there is credible evidence are involved in the practice. 
Chinese population control officials, working with employers and work unit officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles, incredibly enough. They subject women who conceive without Government authorization--they do not have a certificate to conceive--to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, and in some instances physical force. 
It has been estimated that China commits about a half a million third-trimester abortions every year. Most of these babies are fully viable when they are killed. Virtually all of these abortions are performed against the mother's will. 
Steven Mosher, the director of Asian studies at California's Claremont Institute, can personally account to seeing doctors carrying chokers. These chokers are similar to the little garbage ties that we use to tie up garbage bags. They are placed around the little baby's neck during delivery. The baby then dies of a painful strangulation over a period of about 5 minutes. 
To my colleagues, I say a government that would force women to undergo these kinds of grisly procedures has no conception of and no respect for human rights. 
On June 10, my colleague in the House, Chris Smith, the chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee on International Relations, held a hearing on this ongoing practice in China. Gao Xiao Duan, the former head of China's Planned Birth Control Office from 1984 to 1988, provided powerful testimony about what she went through, what she was called upon to enforce, and her own nightmarish experience until she was unable and unwilling to live with a guilty conscience because of what she was doing. She resigned. She left. She got out of that grisly business. 
Well, it is that kind of practice, along with what I have in the past elaborated on related to religious persecution that is ongoing in China today, on which this body needs to take a stand. The House of Representatives voted for these measures, and voted for them overwhelmingly. The forced abortion provision in the House of Representatives passed by a vote of 415-1. And it is time that the Senate quit stalling and quit dragging its feet, quit avoiding these issues. 
It is time that we faced the abuses in China forthrightly and honestly. And I believe, far from embarrassing the President as he makes this trip to China, it is incumbent upon us to strengthen his ability to address human rights issues at Tiananmen Square and in dealing and meeting with Government officials throughout China, throughout his 8-day visit in China. 
So I ask my colleagues to rethink the desire of many to avoid a clean up-and-down vote on the substance of these amendments, which, frankly, I have heard no one get up and argue that this is the wrong position to take or this should not be the public policy of our country. Instead, I have heard vague talk that we should not vote at this time with efforts to try to avoid taking a clear stand on this issue.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will quote a portion of that editorial today from the Washington Post: 
Li Hai, 44, a former teacher at the Chinese Medical College, is serving a nine-year sentence in Beijing's Liangxiang Prison. His crime: assembling a list of people jailed for taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989. From the Beijing area alone, he documented more than 700. Of those, 158--mostly workers, rather than students--received sentences of more than nine years and are presumed still held. Many were sentenced to life in prison, from a 22-year-old named Sun Chuanheng to a 76-year-old named Wang Jiaxiang. Li Hai himself was convicted of `prying into and gathering . . . state secrets.' 
We thought of Mr. Li as we read President Clinton's explanation in Newsweek yesterday of `Why I'm Going to Beijing.' Mr. Clinton wrote of the `real progress--though far from enough' that China has made in human rights during the past year. . . . 
Tomorrow Mr. Clinton will leave for China, the first president to visit since the Tiananmen massacre. His aides promise that he will speak out on human rights while there, and there is a chance he will meet with the mother of a student killed in Tiananmen. The first could be valuable if his remarks are broadcast on Chinese television; the second, an important symbol, especially because many relatives of Tiananmen victims continue to be persecuted and harassed. But Mr. Clinton's remarks, above all, should be honest. For the sake of Li Hai, the 158 he documented and the many he did not find, Mr. Clinton should not trumpet `real progress' in a human rights record where no such progress exists. 
Mr. President, exactly so. We should not create progress where it does not exist. We should not pretend that there is progress where it has not been demonstrated. The exile of high-profile dissidents, their exile to the United States, people who are then told, you are free so long as you never return to your homeland, your fatherland--this is what is hailed as human rights progress? I, for one, will say no, that is not true. 
The abuses are great. It is time that the U.S. Senate took its stand. It is time that the U.S. Senate quit avoiding our responsibility, as the elected representatives, to the people of this country and that we be willing to simply cast our own convictions on these amendments, that we not, through parliamentary tactics, through what is now called `throwing a vote,' try to make a vote meaningless by everyone voting contrary to their own beliefs so as to avoid a clear up-or-down vote on which the American people can make a judgment. 
Let there be no mistake. Let's all understand what we are doing when we vote at 10:15 today. For those who are opposed to these amendments, to vote against tabling is a vote of deception to the American people. It may, in the minds of many, make this vote meaningless. Let us be sure in this country in which freedom reigns, in which the American people, I think, are quite discerning--they will be able to see through the charade of simply circumventing a vote on substance. They will be able to see the pretense of voting one way when you believe another, so that you can avoid voting on the substance and say this is a bad thing, for us to condemn forced abortions, we shouldn't do that; it is a bad thing for us to deny visas for those involved in it; it is a bad thing for the U.S. Government to condemn religious persecution, the persecution of minorities in China, Tibet. No one says that, and yet the efforts were made to avoid a substantive vote on these amendments today. 
I mentioned just a moment ago the high-profile dissidents who have been exiled from their homeland, none of those more prominent than Wei Jingsheng. It has been my privilege and honor to get to know some of those dissidents, who have been exiled, who now in this country advocate for democracy in their homeland. The story of Wei Jingsheng is one of the most intriguing and most inspiring. 
I am quoting now from Orvile Schell's `Mandate of Heaven':  
Wei Jingsheng, a young electrician working at the Beijing zoo, and editor of a publication called `Explorations,' became one of the most trenchant critics of the Chinese Government. On December 5, 1978, he posted a critique of Deng's Modernization Program that insisted that modernizing agriculture, industry, science and technology and national defense without also embracing a fifth modernization, namely, democracy, was futile. That was his crime. He dared to critique his leaders' philosophy by saying, `We may modernize agriculture, industry, science, technology, and defense, but unless we have structural change in the area of democracy, it will be futile.' 
That was his crime. 
Then Wei Jinsheng asked this: 
`What is true democracy?' his wall poster asked. It means the right of people to choose their own representatives, who will work according to their will and in their interests. Only this can be called democracy. Furthermore, the people must have power to replace their representatives any time so that these representatives cannot go on deceiving others in the name of the people. We hold that people should not give any political leader unconditional trust. Does Deng want democracy? No, he does not, asserted Wei. Then as if he were engaged in an actual face-to-face with Deng, Wei Jingsheng added, we cannot help asking, what do you think democracy means if the people do not have a right to express their ideas freely? How can one speak of democracy? If refusing to allow other people to criticize those in power is your idea of democracy, then what is the difference between this and what is euphemistically called the dictatorship of the proletarian? 
Wei was soon arrested. Wei was sentenced to 15 years in prison on charges of having sold state secrets to a foreigner. In jail, he became a troublesome reminder of the party's arbitrary power to suppress political opposition, until he was finally released in the fall of 1993 in an effort by the Chinese government to enhance its chances of bringing the 2000 Olympic games to Beijing.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I was quoting from Orvile Schell's `Mandate of Heaven,' the background and inspiring story of Wei Jingsheng, who went to prison, spent many years in prison, because he dared to say democracy isn't democracy until there is freedom to criticize your elected officials. 
The headline today in the Washington Time says it all: `Beijing Government Denies Visas to Three Reporters.' 
They do not understand freedom. We need to take a stand in this body to say that the practices and the human rights abuses that continue in China are wrong. If they will say that, we will do what is within our power to truly engage the Chinese, the Chinese government, by confronting them where they are wrong, encouraging them where they are making progress. 
This administration has done too little. This amendment today can be a step in the right direction. It can be a step in which we take a forthright stand for human rights and convey a message as our President goes, convey a message to the Chinese Government, that human rights are taken seriously in this country, that human rights will not take a back seat to trade. 
I yield the floor.

They passed the House of Representatives last year.

<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. The question was raised as to the timing of these amendments being offered. The accusation was made this is strictly to score political points. I have no desire to score political points. I would have greatly desired to have the amendments voted on 1 month ago, 2 months ago, or 6 months ago. 
Those who have followed the China policy debate will be well aware that these amendments passed the U.S. House of Representatives last year, have been pending in the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Senate for months, and have languished in that committee without having a hearing. 
Therefore, I think it was perfectly appropriate to file these amendments. The forced abortion amendment was filed more than a month ago on the Department of Defense authorization bill. The provision in the overall amendment dealing with religious persecution in China was filed May 18, well over a month ago. 
I remind my colleague there was never any intent that somehow this debate, on the eve of the President's trip to China--if we had not had a 4-week hiatus in debating tobacco in this Chamber, perhaps we would have had DOD up a month ago and would have had an opportunity to have these amendments voted on a month ago. 
But that wasn't the case. To question my motivation and the motivation of many of my colleagues who feel very deeply about the human rights abuses that are ongoing in China today, I think, is to do us a disservice; and to question our patriotism is wrong. In fact, to question our support for the President as he makes this trip is wrong, because I do support him. To the extent that he will raise human rights issues, to the extent that he will engage Chinese leadership on nuclear proliferation and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and to the extent that the President will engage the Chinese leadership on trade issues, I support him for that. I am glad for that. I believe the amendments I have offered will strengthen the President's ability to deal with the Chinese Government on these sensitive human rights issues. 
We have talked somewhat about the forced abortion provision. I think it is an important part of this. The very powerful subcommittee hearing that Congressman Chris Smith had only a couple of weeks ago, which received wide publicity, perhaps brought to a new level the awareness of the American people regarding the terrible practice of coerced abortions and coerced sterilizations in China today. That is the amendment that is before us at this time. 
People have questioned why we should deal with China and not deal with the broader context of a host of human rights abuses that exist around the world. During the course of the debate on China, I have heard repeatedly that we should not try to isolate China and that one out of every four people in the world lives in China. That is why it is worthwhile for us to deal with the human rights abuses in this nation singularly and specifically. And, truly, the kinds of practices that have been all too commonplace in China deserve our attention. 
I also point out to my colleagues that the issue before us in this amendment is not one of being pro-life or being pro-choice, because people on both sides of the life issue condemn the kinds of practices that are going on in China today in which coerced abortions are used in too many cases, where the one-child family planning policy has not been adhered to. 
So I believe that not only is this a timely amendment, in the sense that it passed the House last year and has been languishing--we have not had an opportunity. Amendments were filed over a year ago. It is quite appropriate that we deal specifically with the case of China and the abuses that are going on there. Once again, had the President delayed the trip, if he were going in November, I would still be pushing for these amendments to be voted on now. I am not a Johnny-come-lately to the China debate. We were involved in this during the MFN debates during my 4 years in the House. This is an issue I feel strongly about. It is an issue I am simply not going to be quiet about. I think if we are to highlight the kinds of freedoms that we as Americans cherish on the eve of our President's trip to a country that is repressed--and today we found out that even three reporters with Radio Free Asia are being denied visas--this is an opportunity for us to do it. We can do it in this country by even disagreeing, at times, with the foreign policy of our country.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I say to the Senator, it is my understanding that they had already been approved by the administration to travel to China and that it was only at the 11th hour that the Chinese Government denied their visas and their right to go and provide coverage for the President's summit in Beijing.

<DOCNO>105-hutchinson-ar-18-19980623</DOCNO>

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I appreciate the question. I think the Senator is exactly right, that visas and the denial of visas can be used to make a political point. The irony of the vote we just cast has not been lost upon you. I hope it hasn't been lost upon the people of the United States. We basically denied a vote and we rejected the possibility of voting up or down on denying visas for those where there is credible evidence that they are involved in forced abortions or religious persecution. We do that on the day that, as the news reported, the Chinese denied visas to those seeking to report on news events, to report to the people of China what is going on at the summit. 
So it is highly ironic. I know Senator Kyl has been greatly involved in the broader reform of our sanctions laws. I think that is a worthwhile endeavor. But that effort does not preclude us from taking these kinds of narrowly targeted actions. That is why the amendment dealing with forced abortions and the denial of visas to those involved in forced abortions and forced sterilization is an appropriate step for us to take, short of MFN, short of trade sanctions, but still with the ability to send a very powerful message.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Your logic is compelling. There should be no objection to the United States utilizing denial of visas as a furtherance of our foreign policy and our belief in human rights, because it is now obvious that it is the practice of the Chinese Government, when they feel it is in their security interests or their national interests, to deny visas. They have no compunction about doing that. In fact, to me, as we look at the buildup to this trip, there has been a lot of give and take, a lot of negotiating that has gone on. It seems to me that we have made many concessions in leading up to this trip. We have been concerned about embarrassing, about causing them to lose faith, about being insensitive to their situation. But for the Chinese Government to deny visas for Radio Free Asia reporters I think is a tremendous kick in the teeth to the American Government and to the American people, who value the freedom of the press so preciously and put such high esteem upon that freedom. 
So it is unfortunate that this has happened, and it is, I think, all too reflective of the attitude of the Chinese Government toward the freedom of the press and freedom in general to have made this clampdown. They just do not seem to get it--rounding up dissidents in Tiananmen Square in preparation for the President. We would rather have a protester there. How heartening it would be to the American people to see someone holding up a sign saying `Free Tibet' there in Tiananmen Square. But no. Their idea is stability at all costs, even if that means repression of the Chinese people.

But, in the evening, I was like all other women and mothers enjoying my life with my children. I could not live such a dual life any more. To all those injured women, to all those children who were killed, I want to repent and say sincerely that I am sorry.' 
That was very powerful testimony that she presented that day. 
She did talk about methods of intimidation and the fines that were enforced, as well as the physical intimidation, and the carrying them off to jail if they refused to have an abortion, and the very severe physical methods that were used, as well as the financial.

I think the testimony of this person, who was the head of the office, actively involved in it, demonstrates this was a very systematic, planned program of coercion that was used across the nation in villages and cities.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Responding to the Senator, this amendment condemns the practice, which I am sure everybody in this Chamber would. It goes further and says that visas will be denied to those individuals for whom there is credible evidence that they have been involved in perpetrating the practice of coerced abortions. That credible evidence would be determined by the Department of State, by the Secretary of State herself, if need be. 
When we talk about enforcement, when we talk about the number of people involved, we are talking here, speaking in this amendment, about credible evidence, and there are human rights groups as well who monitor the conditions in China, who monitor human rights abuses in China, who come forward with reports. And there will be and has been from time to time evidence of individuals who are involved in this horrendous practice. We would say those individuals for whom there is credible evidence that they have been involved in forced abortions should not be allowed to receive a visa and travel to the United States.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. In response to the Senator's question, it is the perpetrator that we are concerned about, it is the person who is enforcing this terrible inhumane policy, brutal policy, grizzly practice of the Government. This certainly isn't the victim. This is a very pro-victim amendment. We want to defend the rights. 
I might add again, as I said before, that this is not a pro-life, pro-choice issue. 
We are dealing here with a practice that is condemned by all civilized societies and that is coerced; forced abortions using physical force to compel a woman to have an abortion against her will. To vote on this, whether it was a month ago, or whether it be 6 months ago, or on this, the eve of the President's trip, in no way would undercut the ability of the Chief Executive of this country to speak about our foreign policy and our values as a people. In fact, I believe sincerely this will strengthen the ability of our Chief Executive, our President, to go to China, to go to Beijing, to speak with Chinese officials and to defend our values with the full support of the Senate and the House of Representatives and the American people.

And so the ability of the central Government to control free speech, free press, freedom of expression really refutes the notion that they are unable to enforce a policy against coerced abortions.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I certainly agree with that statement. I agree. In answering the question, I think that is a correct assertion; that if as much intensity were placed on opening China, on encouraging free expression, on encouraging dissent, as there is on the enforcement of repressive family planning policies and coercive family planning policies, then I think it would be a far different China, and there would be a far different attitude by the American people and by our Government. 
The President is correct. I do not believe we can reach our full potential in our relationship with China until we see a revolution in the structure of China, until we see a revolution in freedom in China. I believe that will come. The question is does it come through the current policy, which I think fails to fully engage. 
You know, those of us who are critics of the current administration's China policy have been called isolationists. I 
believe the real isolationists in this debate are those who want to turn a blind eye to things like coerced abortions, those who want to pretend that religious persecution is not going on in China and don't want to address it. So when we find those today who say this is the wrong timing and we don't want to vote on this, this isn't the appropriate time to vote on coerced abortion, this isn't the appropriate time to vote on religious persecution, that appears to me to be something other than an engagement policy. That would seem to me to be an isolationist policy. We don't want to engage them. We should. We should engage them on a full range of issues, including human rights. 
And my concern about this administration's policy is that human rights, which at one time was placed on the first tier, when President Clinton, then candidate Clinton said he would not coddle dictators from Baghdad to Beijing, that now is dropped from the first tier to at least the third tier, with trade being No. 1; security, to the extent it is being engaged, No 2; and human rights dropping down to No. 3. I believe, if we are going to have a policy of engagement--and truly have a policy of engagement--we must fully engage them equally on all of these fronts.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. In response to the Senator's question, I would say to the Senator from Missouri that, indeed, there is a relationship. I believe that when life is cheapened in one area, whether that is demonstrated through forced labor, slave labor camps, laogai camps, as they are called in China; whether it is demonstrated through religious persecution and the exile and execution of religious dissidents, religious minorities, or whether it is demonstrated through coerced abortion practices, the cheapening of human life carries over into all aspects of a nation's policy. So the willingness of the Chinese Government, according to the CIA report, to have 13 of their ICBMs targeting the American cities--and as the Senator calls them, city-busters, because the purpose is to have a wide devastation--I think it is related, directly related to that cheapening of human life and the lack of respect for the dignity of human life. 
So I would respond to the Senator that way. I certainly think there is a relationship. I appreciate the Senator's question. 
I would just say in concluding on this amendment that our own State Department in issuing its China Country Report for 1997 on Human Rights Practices in China addressed this issue of forced abortions. I will only read a small portion of the State Department's report. I think it underscores how serious the situation is. This isn't something that human rights activists on the left and the right in the United States are dreaming up. It is not some fiction that we have created. Our own State Department, in examining the human rights conditions in China, has assessed it this way. 
Penalties for excess births can also be levied against local officials and the mothers' work units, thus creating multiple sources of pressure. Fines for giving birth without authorization vary, but they can be a formidable disincentive. According to the State Family Planning Commission 1996 family planning manual, over 24 million fines were assessed between 1985 and 1993 for children born outside family planning rules. In Fujian, the standard fine has been calculated to be twice a family's gross annual income. 
That is to violate the family planning rulings in China makes you suspect, makes you vulnerable to a fine that would be twice your gross annual income. That is an incredibly difficult burden to place on this kind of a so-called violation. 
Additional unauthorized births incur fines assessed in increments of 50 percent per child. In Guangzhou the standard fine is calculated to be 30 to 50 percent of 7 years' income for the average resident. In some cases a `social compensation fee' is also imposed. Unpaid fines have sometimes resulted in confiscation or destruction of homes and personal property by local officials. Central government officials acknowledge that such incidents occur, but insist that cases like these are not the norm nor in line with official policy. 
The government prohibits the use of force to compel persons to submit to abortion or sterilization, but poor supervision of local officials who are under intense pressure to meet family planning targets can result in instances of abuse including forced abortion and sterilization. 
And the report goes on into great detail, and I think provides clear documentation for the need for this amendment. 
I think also if you consider, once again, the testimony that was presented before the House Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, the testimony concerning the implementation of the abortion policy of China and the one-child policy of China is truly frightening. 
I will simply read some of these points to establish the routine the family planning bureau is following: 
I. To establish a computer bank of all women of child-bearing age in the town [whatever town size it might be], including their dates of birth, marriages, children, contraceptive ring insertions, pregnancies, abortions, child-bearing capabilities, etc. 
II. To issue `birth-allowed certificates' to women who meet the policy and regulations of the central and provincial planned-birth committees, and are therefore allowed to give birth to children. . . . Without a certificate, women are not allowed to give birth to children. 
You have to apply. You have to get a certificate. You have to get permission to birth a child. 
Should a woman be found pregnant without a certificate, abortion surgery is performed immediately, regardless of how many months she is pregnant. 
I spoke earlier that estimates range as high as a half-million third trimester abortions in China each year. And then, to issue `birth not allowed' notices. Such notices are sent to couples when the data concludes that they do not meet the requirements of the policy and are, therefore, not allowed to give birth. A couple whose first born is a boy, or whose first born is a girl but who give birth to a second child, boy or girl, receives such a notice after a period of 3 years and 2 months. Such notices are made public. The purpose of this is to make it known to everyone that the couple is in violation of the policy, therefore facilitating supervision of the couple. 
They issue birth control measure implementation notices. They impose monetary penalties on those who violate the provincial regulations. Should they refuse to pay these penalties, supervision team members will apprehend and detain them as long as they do not pay. 
The PBO regularly supervises and examines how staff members of Planned Parenthood offices in 22 villages perform their duties. They write monthly synopses of the planned birth reports, which are signed by the town head and the town Communist Party. They analyze informant materials. They have established, in China, a system of informants in accordance with the informing system, and have put these cases on file for investigation. 
They have planned birth cadres. There was testimony before Congressman Smith's subcommittee indicating that these cadres, and the number of people involved in this program, has increased dramatically in recent years, indicating that rather than retreating from this coercive practice, they, instead, are pursuing it with new vigor. 
We go on in this testimony. I think it should be a concern to all Americans that this practice is being tolerated and that we have not taken, as the foreign policy of our country, a strong, strong position which this amendment would allow us to do. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for the opportunity to work with him on this issue. I believe the China amendments I have offered have great value. The debate has been healthy, and the debate has been necessary. I, frankly, am willing to stand here and talk about human rights in China in general this week and next week, or as long as it takes. My great objective is to see these provisions become the public policy of this land. 
In my opinion, the opponents of these amendments do not have a substantive leg to stand on. The only reason they have brought up to oppose these amendments involves the timing of the offering of these amendments. I remind my colleagues, once again, that I offered these and filed these amendments over a month ago. They have sought to obfuscate the issues, obscure the motivations, and place obstacles in the path of clean and substantive votes. The hollowness of the administration's policy is evident in their unwillingness to embrace these very modest human rights amendments. 
Mr. President, if I might say again, the hollowness of the administration's China policy is evident in their unwillingness to embrace even those modest human rights amendments, and the length to which they have gone to block them from a vote on their merits, I think, speaks to the weakness of the policy. The policy has failed. The lack of outrage by this administration over the news today that China denied visa approval for Radio Free Asia reporters, I think, gives powerful testimony to the kind of acquiescence and concessionary spirit that characterizes this administration's policies. It is all too typical. 
These issues will not go away, I assure you. Slave labor conditions, forced abortions, forced sterilizations, religious persecution, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are real issues. They are not fiction or partisan weapons; they are not used for some kind of political brownie points or `got-you' points. These are real issues that need to be debated, and we need to change our foreign policy in relation to these abuses that are ongoing in China. 
If history teaches us anything, history teaches us that appeasement never works. The fact that this administration has refused even to offer the annual resolution at the U.N. convention in Geneva on human rights, I think, is indicative that even the smallest stands for human rights have gone by the wayside. I think it was Edmund Burke who said, `All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.' 
What the Senate has done today on China policy is nothing. The fact that these bills passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives, the fact that this body voted not to table them by 80-plus votes, indicates there is strength in their appeal. I want to express my appreciation to the majority leader for the commitment he has made today to bring up H.R. 2358 in July for a vote and that the China issue will be addressed, and that 
whether it is Senator Abraham or Senator Wellstone, or others, who have issues regarding bills regarding China, they will have an opportunity to debate them and to offer them. I compliment and commend the majority leader for that public commitment today. I will continue to press for votes on these provisions. I will look for legislative vehicles, if necessary. 
These concerns that I have expressed are not, as they have been portrayed, partisan politics. This afternoon, I attended a press conference in which there were more Democrats than Republicans expressing their concern about the human rights policy of this administration toward China. This is not partisan politics. This has nothing to do with Republicans trying to make points. I probably have as much difference on some of them on my side of the aisle as I do on some of them on the other side of the aisle. So people can stand and say that we should not use foreign policy as an instrument of partisan politics. Well, this is not. This is a bipartisan concern about human rights abuses in China that have not improved under the policy of this administration. 
There is much more that we need to do, on a bipartisan basis, to press the cause of basic human rights and democracy in China. It is my sincere hope that President Clinton will take every opportunity to elevate these issues during his trip, which he embarks on tomorrow. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, in the few minutes we have, I would like to respond to my good friend and colleague from Connecticut, to some of the comments he made about the pending business and the amendments I have offered regarding China. 
He spoke of engagement and the necessity of the engagement policy, and as has so often been the case with administration defenders and the defenders of the engagement policy, they would present a false dichotomy in that if you are not for the current administration's policy, then you are an isolationist. I would suggest it is not engagement or isolation; it is how we are going to engage China. 
I would further suggest that the policy this administration has pursued has failed in engaging China adequately. That is evident in a whole host of areas, not the least of which are the abuses addressed by these amendments. 
So when my good friend from Connecticut said that he is opposed to these amendments, I was tempted to ask specifically what amendment is it--denying visas to those who perform forced abortions, or is it denying visas to government individuals involved in religious persecution? What is it precisely that is objectionable about these? I would think, rather than undermining the President's hand as he goes to China, this in fact strengthens his hand, strengthens his ability to deal in a more forthright way with those issues of concern to all Americans. 
My good friend from Connecticut also spoke in glowing terms of the `changed China.' It is becoming more common to hear of the `changed China.' 
In the edition of Newsweek magazine which just came out is a cover article, a beautiful cover article, entitled `The New China.' `The New China.' 
Well, I wish that as we looked at the experience of the Chinese people today and what has happened since 9 years ago and the Tiananmen massacre, we could be reassured that there were students to gather on the Tiananmen plaza during the President's visit next week, in fact they would receive a different greeting than they did 9 years ago when they were mowed down with gunfire. 
Well, is China different? Is it a new China? These are just reports in the last 3 weeks. New York Times, June 6: A bishop in the underground Catholic Church has been arrested, was detained on May 31 while traveling to his village. 
This is the changed China. 
June 14, the Portland Oregonian reports that Chinese police interrogated and threatened three dissidents who urged President Clinton to press Chinese leaders on human rights during the summit. Police ransacked the homes, confiscated their computers, took two to local precincts. June 14. 
June 15, South China Morning Post: Dissidents in several areas including Shanghai and Weifang in Shangdong Province, the first stop for Mr. Clinton, have complained of harassment. Incidents have included home raids, detention, telephone tapping and confiscation of computers. 
June 16, Japan Economic News Wire. In the runup to President Bill Clinton's visit to China, a veteran Chinese dissident has been indicted for helping another activist escape to Hong Kong. 
June 18, Far Eastern Economic Review reports that Beijing warned the Vatican, `Don't use the Internet or other media channels to interfere with Chinese religious affairs policies.' And we could go on and on. 
That is the last 3 weeks, Mr. President, of news accounts of what is going on in China. That is the `new China.' We want to present China today in some kind of rose-colored glasses, that everything is fine, when in fact it is not.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I would love to yield to my good friend from Oklahoma, but I have 5 minutes left. Unfortunately, the Presiding Officer has assured me he is going to gavel me quiet at 3 o'clock, so I am going to have to talk very quickly. 
The issue of religious freedom was raised, and my friend from Connecticut spoke once again in glowing terms of improved conditions in China on the issue of religious freedom. While my friend quoted from the New York Times--my good friend and distinguished colleague, whom I admire greatly--I would like 
to quote from the State Department's Report on Religious Freedom in China just issued in the last--it is a 1997 report just issued recently on China, and I will quote just a portion of this. 
Some religious groups have registered while others were refused registration and others have not applied. Many groups have been reluctant to comply due to principled opposition to state control of religion, unwillingness to limit their activities or refusal to compromise their position on matters such as abortion. They fear adverse consequences if they reveal as required the names and addresses of members and details about leadership activities, finances and contacts in China or abroad. 
Guided by a central policy directive of October 1996 that launched a national campaign to suppress unauthorized religious groups and social organizations, Chinese authorities in some areas made strong efforts to crack down on the activities of unregistered Catholic and Protestant movements. They raided and closed several hundred house church groups, many with significant memberships, properties and financial resources. 
And it goes on and gives many examples of that. So, in fact, our State Department--whatever else the New York Times may say, our State Department says that conditions in China are deplorable and that in fact there has been a crackdown on those who would defy the Government by not registering because of principled opposition to the Government's policy. 
Now, we say--and I have heard it argued even today--that the church and religious organizations in China are flourishing. Well, they are growing, but I would just suggest that they are growing in spite of Government policy, in spite of the persecution, not because there has somehow been a blossoming of religious freedom in China. 
As I think back to the early days of Christianity and how the Roman empire cracked down with great intensity upon the infant Christian faith, the Christian faith mushroomed and spread all across the known world at that time. But they did so in spite of intense persecution, and actually Christianity began to demise when suddenly it was made the `official religion.' So to say somehow growth equates with freedom in China today, I simply reject that. 
I have much, much more that I would like to say. I do want to say a word about the President's plans to be received in Tiananmen Square. Mrs. Ding Zilin, mother of a 17-year-old student who was killed in 1989 in the Tiananmen protest, said that she hoped President Clinton would make a strong gesture. Her husband is associate professor of philosophy at the People's University in Beijing. They said this. They objected to the pomp and ceremony in Tiananmen Square as the red carpet `is dyed with the blood of our relatives who have fallen.' 
I wonder, with the emphasis upon property control, if the President would feel the same about following protocol if those hundreds of students who were slain had included some American students, perhaps there as foreign exchange students. 
One thing is certain. When the President goes to Tiananmen, it will be peaceful. It will be quiet. All dissidents will have been rounded up, and there will be no embarrassing protesters. When President Jiang Zemin came to the United States, there were protesters. When Jiang was asked about it, he mocked the protesters, saying with a smile that periodically he heard little voices and noises in his ear. There will be no such embarrassing little noises in his ear when President Clinton goes to Tiananmen Square. 
How do we turn what I think is an unfortunate decision to go to Tiananmen Square into something positive? Perhaps the President could give a Reagan-like speech, when President Reagan went to the Berlin Wall in 1987 and he said, `Tear down this wall.' 
It was Jiang who said that all of the protest in 1989 was `much ado about nothing.' That was the President's attitude--much ado about nothing. Perhaps President Clinton could ask for an official apology. Perhaps he could ask for the release of the dissidents. They have never investigated; they have never apologized; they have never released the dissidents. Perhaps he could take a lead from the Italian President, who last week, after the official reception, returned to Tiananmen Square, where he prayed and where he meditated and where he remembered those who fell. Perhaps the President, in going to Tiananmen, could bring a wreath in memory of those. 
And then I would suggest this as well, that when the President raises the issue of human rights, he does so not before a press briefing but that he does so on his broadcast to the Chinese people. And if he will do so, it will be at least a small step in turning what I think is an unfortunate image for the world to see, into something that can be positive in this trip to China. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I would like to speak on several amendments which I would have offered today had objection not been raised. These amendments, to which objection has been raised on the basis that they are controversial, are, word for word, provisions that passed the U.S. House of Representatives many months ago by overwhelming margins. 
The first amendment I will be speaking on passed the House of Representatives by a margin of 415 to 1. It is that amendment dealing with coerced and forced abortions in the Nation of China to which objection has been raised and to which I will speak this morning. 
I further point out, these amendments were filed May 20, a month ago, to the defense authorization bill, and I announced my intent, even prior to that, to offer these amendments and to ensure that those provisions which passed the House with such overwhelming support, reflecting overwhelming public support for these provisions, would have an opportunity to be voted on in the U.S. Senate. 
I think those votes would have occurred much sooner had they not been tied up in committee. I think that they have overwhelming support, not only by the country, not only by the U.S. House of Representatives, but by the U.S. Senate, and when we have a chance to vote on them--and we will--that we will see them pass this body just as assuredly, and by the same kind of margin, as they passed the House. 
So, while there may be objection raised on the basis that they are controversial amendments, I think when the vote happens we will find they are really not controversial at all. I think we are going to find very few Senators willing to cast nay votes on amendments which are so commonsensical and so reflect the moral values of the American people. We will have an opportunity to find out later, but objection has been raised. 
The intent in offering these amendments somehow has been construed as being an effort to embarrass the President. I have no desire to embarrass the President on the eve of his trip. I do think it is important we send a certain message, and a clear, resounding message, to the Chinese Communist Government as to how important human rights abuses in that Nation--how important they are to our country, to our people, and to our Government. 
I would have been delighted to have had this debate and this vote a month ago. Had it not been for prolonged, extended debate on the tobacco bill, that would have happened. So the timing for the offering of these amendments is not such to have some design to embarrass the President on the eve of his trip to Beijing. The timing was unavoidable because of the prolonged, extended debate on the tobacco bill that I think ran into 4 weeks. But I remind my colleagues on the floor this morning, these amendments were offered a month ago, there was public attention paid to these amendments a month ago, and it was clearly announced that I intended to offer them a month ago. I think it is unfortunate we cannot go ahead and offer those amendments to the defense authorization bill today. 
The amendment, as I say, mirrors the language that passed overwhelmingly on the floor of the House. It would do two things. First, it condemns those officials of the Chinese 
Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and other Chinese nationals involved in forced abortions and sterilization. I hardly think that is controversial. I do not think there are many people in this country who would say we should not condemn the practice of forced abortions and forced sterilizations. So the amendment does that. 
Second, the amendment would prevent such persons from entering or remaining in the United States. That is, it would deny visas to those Communist Government officials who are involved in the practice of forced sterilizations and forced abortions in the Nation of China. It would be based upon credible evidence, and that credible evidence would be ascertained by the Secretary of State. So, to the extent that that information is available, to the extent that we have factual evidence that a person is involved in this horrendous practice, as determined by our Secretary of State, then visas would be denied to those individuals. 
I just find it very difficult to see anything controversial about those two provisions in this amendment, but objection has been raised, although it passed by 415 to 1 in the House of Representatives. The objection has been raised on the basis of it being controversial because it condemns those Chinese Communist Party officials involved in abortions and sterilizations and would prevent them from receiving visas to travel to this country if the Secretary of State so determined that credible evidence indicated they were involved in that. That is the controversial amendment we are not allowed to offer today to the defense authorization bill. 
In an attempt to reach a 1 percent annual population growth rate, Chinese authorities, in 1979, instituted a policy of allowing one child per couple, providing monetary bonuses and other benefits as incentives. In subsequent years, it has been widely reported that women with one living child, who become pregnant a second time, are often subjected to rigorous pressure to end the pregnancy and undergo sterilization. 
Forced abortion and sterilization have not only been used in Communist China to regulate the number of children but to eliminate those regarded as defective under China's eugenics policy, the so-called natal and health care law. This law requires couples at risk of transmitting disabling congenital defects to their children to use birth control or undergo sterilization. 
China's leadership has admitted that coerced abortions and involuntary sterilizations occur but insists that officials involved in such incidents are acting outside the law and are punished. The extent to which this policy is carried out is not known, and while its enforcement is not uniform throughout China, the very fact that such a policy exists is abhorrent to people around the world who believe in basic human rights. 
China's population control officials, working with employers and work unit officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles. They subject women who conceive without government authorization to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment and, in some instances, physical force. 
The aborting of unauthorized pregnancies, regardless of the stage of pregnancy--first trimester, second trimester, or even third trimester--is apparently, in China, a routine occurrence. Some have argued that China commits about half a million third-trimester abortions annually. Most of these babies are fully viable when they are killed, and virtually all of these abortions are performed against the mother's will. 
I have also been told by those who have studied this issue that women are often imprisoned, brainwashed, and refused food until they finally break down and agree to the performing of an abortion. The actual methods by which doctors carry out these procedures are often unnerving and horrific. It has been reported that doctors commonly inject women with a shot of Rivalor, commonly known as `the poison shot,' which directly causes congestive heart failure in the baby. 
The baby slowly dies over the course of 2 or 3 days, at which time the baby will be delivered dead. 
I have also been made aware of reports that Chinese doctors also inject pure formaldehyde into the baby's soft spot of their head or the skull is crushed by the doctor's forceps. 
Steven Mosher, the Director of Asian Studies at California's Claremont Institute, can personally account for seeing doctors carrying `chokers.' These chokers are similar to our white twisty garbage ties. They are placed around the baby's neck during delivery. The baby then dies of painful strangulation over a period of about 5 minutes. 
A government that would force women to undergo these kinds of grisly procedures obviously has no respect for basic human rights. 
China currently has legislation that requires women to be sterilized after conceiving two children, and they even go so far as to demand sterilization of either the man or the woman if traces of a `serious hereditary disease' are found in an effort to eliminate the presence of children with handicaps, illnesses or other characteristics they might consider to be `abnormal.' 
Numerous international organizations have found that the Chinese Government utilizes in the sterilization method to control population horrendous practices. Mr. President, the practice of forced abortions by the Communist Chinese Government was truly exposed to America when my good friend and my former colleague in the House, Congressman Chris Smith, chairman of the International Operations and Human Rights Subcommittee of the House International Relations Committee held a hearing just less than 2 weeks ago, June 10. This hearing featured compelling testimony from a former administrator of China's Planned Birth Control Office on the use of coercive population control in order to achieve the Communist Government's one-child-per-couple limit. 
Ms. Gao Xiao Dunn, the former head of China's Planned Birth Control Office from 1984 to 1988, admitted--and we have heard testimony of what she said before the House subcommittee less than 2 weeks ago, the former head of the birth control office of Communist China, this is what she testified. She said:  
Once I found a woman who was 9 months pregnant, but did not have a birth-allowed certificate. According to the policy, she was forced to undergo an abortion surgery. In the operation room, I saw how the aborted child's lips were sucking, how its limbs were stretching. A physician injected poison into its skull and the child died, and it was thrown into the trash can. To help a tyrant do evils was not what I wanted. I could not bear seeing all those mothers grief-stricken by induced delivery and sterilization. I could not live with this on my conscience. I, too, after all, am a mother. 
That was her very vivid, very powerful testimony before the House subcommittee, this former head of China's Planned Birth Control Office from 1984 to 1988. I think that her testimony, so very compelling, demands this body and this Government and this administration to take a stand in every way possible against these kinds of practices. 
In addition, Mrs. Gao Xiao Dunn admitted: 
When I was in my hometown in China, I saw how a large number of pregnant women were hiding anywhere they could. Some of them were 9 months pregnant, but were forced to undergo abortion procedures just the same--simply because they had no `birth-allowed certificates.' The government dismantled the houses of some of them and made them homeless. The government's planned birth policy is extremely stern. In my native village, I saw how many women were looking for places to hide at night, because the government usually catches people at night. All this made me terrified. 
There are those who apologize for the Chinese Government. They say, `Oh, things are better, but these are not things going on today.' Here is someone who knows. Here is someone who was involved in it. Here is someone who became so guilt-stricken by her own involvement in this practice that she couldn't stand it any longer and has come forward to tell that story. 
In her testimony, she discussed the abortions that occurred in jails where women were placed in jail who were fighting the physician's attempts to abort her child. She spoke of not only the jails where they were incarcerated, but she spoke of the abortion bed where women were tied in by leather straps and where those terrible procedures were performed. Their homes were destroyed if they fought the Government strictures on the one-child policy. 
What does our own State Department say? If we are not willing to accept the testimony of someone who put their own future in jeopardy by coming forward before a House subcommittee and telling their very vivid, compelling story, perhaps we will listen to our own State Department, because in the most recent human rights report on China issued only a few months ago, our own State Department said:  
The Government does not authorize the use of force to compel persons to submit to abortion or sterilization, but officials acknowledge that there are instances of forced abortions and sterilizations. . . . Poor supervision of local officials under intense pressure to meet family planning targets results in instances of abuse, including forced abortion and sterilization. . . . There are credible reports that several women were forced to undergo abortions of unauthorized pregnancies in Fujian. . . . Newspapers in Shenyang reported that family planning agents convinced a woman 7 months pregnant to take `appropriate measures.' 
That is an abortion, although she was in the seventh month. 
A well-documented incident of a 1994 forced 8-month abortion has been reported in the coastal province of Guangdong. A 1995 incident involving a forced sterilization was also reported in Guangdong. 
That is from the State Department. That is the end of the quote from our own State Department report. 
The Chinese Communist Government will deny that it is the official policy to encourage coerced abortions. They acknowledge that. Even the Chinese Communist Government acknowledges that these terrible practices occur. 
What do other human rights organizations say? We have heard from a former director of the birth control agency in China. We have heard from our own State Department, but independent groups that monitor human rights abuses in China have weighed in as well. 
Amnesty International has expressed its strong opposition to these coerced abortions, forced sterilization practices. In a 1996 report, `Women in China: Detained, Victimized, but Mobilized,' it iterated its profound concerns about these practices: 
Testimonies have indicated that officials have resorted to physical coercion resulting in torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment when faced with this pressure. Family planning cadres continue to be disciplined and fired for failing to keep birth quotas. 
This is from Amnesty International. While Amnesty International takes no position on the official birth control policy in China, they are concerned about the human rights violations which result from its coercive application. Like many of the human rights organizations that monitor China, I am concerned by reports that forced abortion and sterilization have been carried out by or at the instigation of people acting in an official capacity--such as family planning officials--against women who are detained, restricted or forcibly taken from their homes to have the operation. 
Previous reports by Amnesty International and other organizations have cited a wide range of evidence regarding the use of forcible measures taken from official family planning reports and regulations. Articles in the official Chinese press, testimonies from former family-planning officials, and testimonies from victims of forced abortion all attest that this is all too common still in 1997 in China. 
Reports have also detailed cases of hostages being taken and ill-treatment by officials of the relatives of couples who failed to pay birth control fines or who had fled their villages attempting to avoid abortion or sterilization. 
The Chinese authorities have never responded to such reports in detail. In recent years, they have simply asserted that `coercion is not permitted,' but they admit that it is going on. Mr. President, I am concerned that there is no evidence the Chinese authorities have yet set in place effective measures to ensure that such coercion is not only forbidden on paper, but punished and prevented in practice. 
I have been unable to find any instance of sanctions taken against officials who perpetuate such violations. In other words, the Chinese Communist Government today in the enforcement of their one-child policy turns a blind eye to local officials who use coercion, who use force, to compel women to have abortions against their will. 
Mr. President, the absence of laws and regulations in China concerning coercive family planning has become even more cause for concern since 1995. Since that time, China has made numerous commitments at the international level to combating violence against women. However, the absence of any substantive laws regulating forced abortions and sterilization appear to widen the potential for coercion. 
Mr. President, I am aware that some have concerns about how we can assure compliance with this amendment's requirement that visas be denied to individuals involved with these nefarious practices of forced abortions, of forced abortions and sterilizations. While I would expect a determined effort would be made to identify persons involved in such actions prior to the issuance of such visas, I recognize that enforcement will not be easy in every instance. And I would state that what is most important is that we provide both a strong condemnation of these practices, which the amendment does, and that we provide a mechanism for taking action against those responsible for them when credible information about their activities comes to light. 
Let me reiterate, there is absolutely nothing controversial about this amendment. We are talking about the kinds of family planning practices condemned across the political spectrum, by all who are concerned about moral values and basic human rights, that we take the modest action of saying we ought to condemn it as a government and we ought to deny visas to those who are perpetuating the practice in China, that to the extent we can identify them, to the extent that credible information comes forward, they should not be given visas to travel to this country. I do not believe--I really in my heart--do not believe there is anybody on the other side of the aisle who thinks this is a bad thing to do. So I am perplexed and I am befuddled that anybody would object to this amendment as being controversial. 
Not only is China an increasing threat internationally, but within their own borders they continue to oppress their own people. And we should not simply turn a blind eye and say we do not want to talk about it or that it might cause embarrassment to either our President or to the Chinese Government. What a pitiful excuse for not addressing the issue. 
Involuntary abortion or sterilization should be condemned, and it should be condemned in the strongest terms as a violation of human rights, a violation of the first order. 
I want to read a brief excerpt from Nicholas Kristof and his wife Sheryl Wudunn from their book, the 1994 book, `China Wakes, The Struggle for the Soul of a Rising Power.' Mr. Kristof was the New York Times' Beijing bureau chief, and his wife Ms. Wudunn was a New York Times Beijing correspondent in the late 1980s. They are the only married couple to have ever won the Pulitzer Prize award. 
In 1989, Mr. Kristof and Ms. Wudunn were awarded with the Pulitzer Prize for their reporting during the Tiananmen Square massacre. They saw firsthand the Chinese Government's reprehensible practices. In particular, apart from the Tiananmen Square massacre, they saw firsthand the practices of 
forced abortions and sterilizations. 
This is what they wrote, these two prize-winning authors. They wrote: 
The family planning authorities routinely forced young women to undergo abortions and sterilization. The township authorities send teams into the villages once or twice a year to collect all the women who are due to be fitted with an IUD or to be sterilized. Some run away, in hopes they can remain fertile and have another baby, and the authorities then send goons to the women's relatives in other villages, even in other provinces, to find and sterilize them. Usually, they do not have to drag a woman to the operating table; when half a dozen men surround her home and order her to come out, she may not see much sense in fighting back. 
Mr. President, the bottom line is that the practice of forced abortion and sterilization is inhumane. The practice is repugnant, and it is morally reprehensible. 
This amendment, which I hope to be able to offer in the near future--this amendment is not about a peculiarly American view of rights. It is not even about whether you are pro-life or pro-choice. It does not have a thing to do with this amendment. The use of force coercion, intimidation to commit such crimes against humanity is something that we all as a freedom-loving people--Democrat, Republican, pro-life, pro-choice--that all of us can join together in vigorously denouncing. 
I remind you again, what this amendment does is to condemn the practice and say, to the extent that we can identify these individuals, with credible information--the Secretary of State can do that--we will deny them visas. This amendment, this `very controversial' amendment, passed by a vote of 415-1 in the House of Representatives, this amendment to which objection has been made today on the basis of it being controversial. 
Mr. President, were I able to offer additional amendments today--and I had four prepared to be offered--I would move to amendment No. 2423, which I will not offer, but I intend to debate and make a statement on. 
This is another `controversial' amendment. It passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 366-54. I filed this amendment back on May 20, almost a month ago. I announced my intent at that time that I would offer this amendment to the defense authorization bill. It mirrors the language that passed the House of Representatives. It would do three things. 
It states, as congressional policy, that religious freedom should be a major facet of the President's policy towards China. Secondly, the amendment would prohibit the use of American funds appropriated for the Department of State, USIA or AID to pay for the travel of Communist Chinese officials involved in the monitoring of government-approved churches in China, or the formulation of implementation of policies to repress worship. 
So it would deny our Government paying the travel expenses for those who are involved in the Chinese Communist Government in monitoring and supervising churches, places of worship, and those who were involved in the repression and the persecution of religious minorities. 
Thirdly, it would deny visas to officials engaged in religious persecution--not the head of Government, not Cabinet members; we would exempt them; and not those who are the official heads of the Patriotic churches, but to Government officials involved in the persecution and repression of religious minorities--they 
would be denied visas. The conditions and the criteria would be the same--credible information, credible evidence as determined by the Secretary of State. 
Mr. President, since the founding of the People's Republic of China almost 50 years ago, the Chinese Government has too often been involved in the persecution of religious believers. And they have subjected all religious groups in China to comprehensive control by the state and the Chinese Communist Party. 
The five officially recognized religious denominations have been reorganized into state-controlled associations, as the Chinese Buddhist, the Daoist, the Islamic, the Patriotic Catholic associations, and the Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement. Even within the pale of these authorized religions, Tibetan Buddhists and Uigher Moslems in Xinjiang have been subjected to wholesale persecution because of the enduring links between their religion and their national aspirations. For similar reasons, the Chinese Government has forcibly severed all links between Chinese Catholics and Protestants and their foreign coreligionists. 
In fact, while I was in China in January, I met with a group of American nationalists, American expatriates, who are doing business in China. They attend church in China and have an American church. It has to be an American church by law. They cannot allow Chinese people to attend. They have almost 1,000 Americans who attend this church. But in meeting with them, they said, were they to allow any of the Chinese nationals to attend and to worship with them, they would be shut down because of the Chinese Government's fear of any influence from outside its own borders. 
Millions of other religious believers, according to some estimates, the large majority of Chinese, have been deemed to fall outside these five recognized faiths and are simply denied any status as believers and are subjected to criminal penalties for practicing what the Government calls `superstition' or `folk beliefs.' 
Even congregations of authorized denominations are kept under rigid state control through mandatory registration, a requirement enforced with unprecedented severity through the last several years, what they called an anticrime crackdown. The anticrime crackdown became the rationale for cracking down on religious minorities in China. It has been very severe in recent years. Registration entails full state control over religious doctrines. 
I met with seminary officials while I was in China in Shanghai. We had a very interesting discussion. They are recognized, authorized, registered with the Government. But they made it very clear, as well, that there are certain things they are not allowed to do. I asked, could you go down the street, rent a building, and open that building for church services? There was a Government official sitting in the room, and they cast a weary glance at the Government officials, and they said no, that would not be tolerated; worship has to be done in approved places. I said, could you go out on the street, upstairs--we were meeting in a basement--could you go upstairs and pass out religious literature? Once again, a kind of weary glance at the Government officials in the room and they said no, that would not be permitted; religion must be constrained to certain geographical locations--a far different idea of what religious freedom is--in China today. 
The content of preaching in sermons is controlled by the Government. It is not permitted to preach on the `second coming of Christ.' That would be a taboo subject. They would not allow that to be taught or proclaimed in a Protestant or Catholic church in China. 
The selection of clergy--controlled by the Government. Financial affairs, religious materials, building programs--you can't go build a church without getting a zoning requirement. It is a means of controlling the growth, as well as restriction on educational and social welfare projects. There is a complete bar on proselytizing persons under 18 and an official veto over baptism at any age. Registered congregations must reveal the names and addresses of all congregants. 
The head of the state's Religious Affairs Bureau said in 1996, `Our aim is not registration for its own sake but control over places for religious activities, as well as over all religious activities themselves.' I don't know how you could be much more upfront, much more candid, than this official was, an individual who is the head of the entire China state Religious Affairs Bureau and very recently, in 1996, said, `Our aim is not registration . . .' just to register, our goal is `control over places for religious activities, as well as over all religious activities themselves.' The key word is the word `control.' That is the reason they require churches, synagogues, Buddhist temples, that is why they require all religious activities to be approved and sanctioned by the Government. Religious organizations are required to promote socialism and patriotism, while the massive state and party propaganda apparatus vigorously promotes atheism and combat superstition. While the Government officially promotes atheism, they demand that the churches support and promote patriotism. 
Why is there this intense effort to control religion in China? I suggest if you look back to the ancient Roman empire, you can find an example of why that is so important to the Communist Chinese Government. It was the policy of the Roman empire that they practice what they called `religious 
tolerance.' You could have any religion you wanted, so long as whatever religious faith you were, you were willing to acknowledge Caesar as the ultimate sovereign. It would demand that, regardless of your faith, you say Caesar is Lord. That is where Christianity ran into problems in the Roman empire--it was the persecuted religion--because Christians wouldn't say Caesar is Lord, the ultimate sovereign. They saw there was a sovereign, a control beyond the Government, beyond Caesar. 
May I suggest that is exactly the fear of the Chinese Communist Government. While they repressed all political dissent, our own State Department says that all of the political dissidents, all in the democracy movement have been incarcerated, exiled, or executed. So they have eliminated that threat. They see now that which is beyond their control as being the rapid growth of religion. And religion is growing. It is in a tremendous revival. People of faith are multiplying in China. Thus, we find the Chinese Government cracking down on religion because they see that as, in the long term, a threat to their power and their control because here is a body of people who see a loyalty beyond the Government in Beijing. So they crack down. 
The Chinese Government and the Communist Party have in recent years intensified these efforts to expel religious believers from the Government, the military, and the party, ordering a nationwide purging of believers in January 1995. In spite of this, there is a phenomenal growth occurring among people of faith in China. 
But I am deeply concerned about the mounting campaign against people of faith in China. The Roman Catholic Church has been made--at least the part of the Roman Catholic Church that recognizes the Vatican and the papal authority in Rome--has been made effectively illegal in China today. Priests, bishops, people of faith have been imprisoned and harassed. Zheng Yunsu, the leader of a Jesus family, a Protestant community in Shandong Province, is one of many behind bars today simply for practicing their faith. He was arrested during a police raid in the community in 1992. Then he was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for disrupting--listen to this--for `disrupting public order and swindling.' His four sons and other members of the group were also imprisoned. I believe those individuals are prisoners of conscience and prisoners of faith. 
Such persecution of religious groups has followed a substantial religious revival of China in the past 15 years. The Christian community--much of the expansion has been in religious groups that conduct their activities outside the Protestant and Catholic churches recognized by the Government. 
When I visited China in January, I attended a church that worshipped openly, but in order to worship openly, they had to be approved, they had to be sanctioned, they had to be registered by the Government. But the explosive growth among believers in China today of all faiths is occurring primarily among the unregistered, the underground church, the house church movement. 
Here we have a picture that was smuggled out of one of those house churches. You can see, I think, not only the enthusiasm and the faith and the devotion. The picture is worth a thousand words. There are more than a thousand words articulated by that picture. The response of the Chinese Government to this growth of faith has been to crack down, to incarcerate, to persecute, to economically penalize those who would dare to worship according to the dictates of their conscience. That is why we believe we should take a stand. That is what this amendment is all about--condemn the practice, deny visas to those involved in it. I am sorry, but I have a hard time discerning how that could be controversial. 
Mr. President, these peaceful but unregistered religious gatherings have been raided by police. Gatherings like this have been raided by police. Those attending have been beaten, threatened, and detained. Many of those detained are required to pay heavy fines as a condition for release. Those regarded as `leaders' are usually kept in custody and either sentenced to prison terms or administratively detained without charge or trial. 
I was talking just last night with a lobbyist, a lobbyist for a very major American corporation. If I could mention the name of the corporation, everyone would immediately recognize it as being one of the leading companies in this country. This lobbyist engaged me in a discussion on China. I didn't bring it up, he did. He said, `I want to talk to you about your convictions on China.' Then he said, `Senator, our people in Beijing say that there is religious freedom in China today.' Then I began to tell about some of the things that are actually going on, some of what I learned even while I was there. I think that there is a tremendous disinformation to say that things are OK. 
These aren't American views of freedom, these are basic human values. People of faith ought to be able to worship according to the dictates of their conscience and their own hearts, without fear of intimidation, without fear of incarceration, without fear of economic penalty. 
In January 1994, two national regulations on religious activities came into force. Notably, Mr. President, they banned religious activities which `undermine national unity and social stability.' Let me say that again. They banned religious activities which `undermine national unity and social stability.' Whatever in the world does that mean? 
That it the whole point. It is subject to the whims of any local official who wants to interpret it. Under the broad rubric of these two regulations, any activity could be construed as undermining the Chinese Government and, therefore, constitute a threat punishable by prosecution, imprisonment, arrest, and bodily harm. 
These regulations also require that all `places of religious activities' be registered with the authorities, according to the rules formulated by China's Religious Affairs Bureau. 
This means, in effect, Mr. President, that religious groups that do not have official approval may not obtain registration, and that those involved in religious activities in unregistered places may be detained and punished. In other words, if you started a worship service in your home, you could not get official sanction, be registered, and you would be subject to detainment or punishment. Provided in these new regulations are detention and criminal penalties for any violation. 
During this past year, police raids on religious gatherings organized by independent groups have continued, with hundreds of Protestants and Catholics reportedly detained as a result. More than 300 Christians were reported to have been detained in what appears to have been a crackdown by local police on unregistered Protestant houses and churches. 
The evidence is clear that there is an intensified Chinese effort to repress religious liberty. This repression ranges from ransacking homes in Tibet in search of banned pictures of the Dalai Lama to destroying or closing 18,000 Buddhist shrines last spring alone. Ministers, priests, and monks are routinely arrested and imprisoned, tortured, and sometimes killed for the mere expression of their faith. 
Mr. President, I believe not only should we adopt this amendment, which passed with over 350 votes in the House of Representatives, I believe that the President, on his trip to China, should raise this issue to the highest level. I hope he will do that. He said he is not intending to meet with dissidents. I hope he will change his mind. I hope that he will say what the Chinese people can't say, and that while the Chinese people are gagged, our President won't be gagged. He will have the opportunity and I hope he will talk about these issues. 
Mr. President, in Paul Marshall's critically acclaimed book `Their Blood Cries Out,' an authoritative book on religious persecution around the globe, the case of Bishop Su is documented. During Bishop Su's 15 years in China's prison system, he was subjected to various forms of torture. They go through very graphic detail in recounting the kinds of suffering that this bishop endured. Unfortunately, that is not the exception. 
The State Department's most recent report on religious freedom states:  
. . . the government of China has sought to restrict all actual religious practice to government-authorized religious organizations and registered places of worship. 
That is what they have sought to do. Then our State Department goes into a great deal of detail, enunciating exactly the kinds of abuses that are too common in China today. 
There are only a handful of churches that are open in all of Beijing, not because there are not worshipers or believers, but because of the practice of the Government. The legal provisions requiring registration of all religious groups have been used against various groups, including members of Protestant house churches who organize religious meetings in their private homes without having registered with the authorities. Many of these groups and the members of these groups don't register out of a personal conviction. They don't believe it would be proper. They feel they would be restricting their own faith and what they could say and do; so they don't register. Then they face detainment and fines and harassment by the police. Some house churches have voluntarily suspended their meetings because many members were being harassed, and others have regularly changed premises and meeting times for worship, moving from place to place to avoid detection by the authorities. Some congregations have even stopped singing during the worship time in order to avoid detection. 
Pressure to register is reported to have increased in the past year. Reports from various areas show that official control over religious activities has been stepped up. Unregistered Protestant churches in Shanghai have been under increased Government pressure since December of 1994 when authorities announced that `it was illegal to hold religious activities in unregistered places of worship.' The authorities reportedly threatened to fine any person found attending or leading an unregistered house church meeting. Religious books, religious tapes, and even collection boxes and offering plates have been confiscated by Government officials. 
Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that the human costs are higher for unregistered or unauthorized clergy and believers. It is too high. We should and we must denounce it, condemn it, and speak out against it. Today, hundreds of people are serving long prison sentences in China--Buddhists, Taoists, Moslems, Catholics, and Protestants--for simply practicing their religious faith. 
The Beijing government sentenced a 76-year-old Protestant leader to 15 years in prison for the `high crime' of distributing Bibles. Where do you get a Bible in China? There is a lot of talk about how, today, the Chinese Government permits the printing of Bibles. That is true. They set a quota every year. They allow a certain number to be printed, but they can only be distributed in churches, in places of worship which are officially recognized, sanctioned and registered by the Communist government. That is how you get a Bible in China. So this man, 76 years old, was arrested for distributing Bibles illegally. He was sentenced to 15 years. 
But it is controversial for us to condemn that with an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization. Somehow, it is controversial to deny visas to those who are perpetrating these kinds of atrocities against religious believers. I am sorry. 
The Government then sentenced a 65-year-old evangelical elder to an 11-year prison term for belonging to an unauthorized evangelical group. They sentenced a 60-year-old Roman Catholic priest to 2 years of `reeducation through labor' for unknown charges. He had previously spent 13 years in prison because of his refusal to renounce the Vatican. The 6-year-old Panchen Lama--the second highest dignitary in Tibetan Buddhism--has been detained for a year and a half, and his whereabouts are unknown. Scores of Tibetan Buddhists who refused to participate in the Communist Chinese sham enthronement of Beijing's `Panchen Lama' have been sent to prison. One leading Buddhist spiritual teacher committed suicide rather than to take part in the charade. 
I have another chart I want to show you. These are simple news accounts that have occurred--all of them within the last 2 weeks. They are reports in the mainstream media during the last 2 weeks. 
June 14, The Portland Oregonian reported that:  
Chinese police interrogated and threatened three dissidents who urged President Clinton to press Chinese leaders on human rights during the summit. . . . Police ransacked the homes of Leng and Tang, confiscated the computers, and took the two to a local precinct. 
This is occurring within weeks of the President's visit. Instead of things getting better, they are rounding up dissidents in preparation for the President's visit. That is how little they comprehend the value of human rights. That is how little they understand what our concerns are in this country. Instead of releasing dissidents, instead of encouraging free expression, they round them up. 
I think we have all read about the unflattering book published in China about our President. What do they do? They round up the books and don't let the books be in the bookstores when our President visits. That is China today. 
On June 18, the Far Eastern Economic Review reported that, `Beijing warned the Vatican not to use the Internet or other media channels to interfere with China's religious affairs policies.' This is June 18. So it is very current in what the Chinese Government is saying, warning the Vatican not to use the Internet to interfere with their internal, domestic, religious affairs policies. 
On June 16, the New York Times reported on `an hour-long documentary on President Jiang Zemin's state visit to the United States last year.' And it continues. On June 16, the New York Times reported that the Japan Economic News Wire reported that, `In the run-up of President Bill Clinton's visit to China, a veteran Chinese dissident has been indicted for helping another activist escape to Hong Kong.' 
Once again, do you know what gets the publicity? The four, or five, or six high-profile prisoners--I will not use the word `release' because they are not released, they are exiled. They are allowed out of prison and sent to the United States. They said, `Don't return.' This administration would like to say that is a victory for human rights? We used to say that was a travesty of human rights, if you were released from prison, exiled from your country, and not allowed to go back to your homes and families. This is hailed as a victory for human rights. Think about the five or six released. Just remember. Right now, in preparation for the President's visit, they are rounding up the dissidents so there won't be anything that might be embarrassing to the Chinese Government or to the President. Freedom is embarrassing, you know. 
June 15, the Asian Pulse reported: 
U.S. Ambassador to China, James Sasser, said today that many of the sanctions imposed on China by the United States after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre could be lifted in the `not too distant future.' 
The only reason I put this quote in from the Asia Pulse is that we would be giving these signals out, that our Ambassador would be giving these signals out, in view of--this is what they are doing. They are cracking down, they are rounding up the dissidents, they are persecuting believers, and we say we are going to lift the sanctions that were imposed after the massacre. 
On June 15, the South China Morning Post reported that, `Dissidents in several areas, including Shanghai and Weifang In Shangdong Province and Xian, the first stop for President Clinton, have complained of harassment. Incidents include home raids, detention, telephone tapping, and confiscation of computers.' 
I suppose the appropriate thing when you have a visit of the major heads of states, you clean up the streets, paint the buildings, you put your best foot forward, and put your best face on. But the way the Chinese Government views it is, round up anybody that might say something that could be contrary to the party line. 
I am going to go back. This is back to June 6. The New York Times reported that `a bishop in the underground Catholic church has been arrested.' This received about 2 inches of print in the New York Times. When Wei was released, it was banner 
headlines. But when the underground bishop was arrested, it got about 2 inches on page A4 of the New York times. But at least it was there. 
If you will take note, the American people can see that this is what is ongoing. 
When I have the opportunity to offer this amendment--and I will--when the Senate has an opportunity to work its will on this amendment, I will urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment, controversial though it has been deemed, that passed the House of Representatives with over 350 votes, and, in so doing, to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Chinese Government that religious persecution is repugnant, reprehensible, and that such practices will have consequences. 
I remind you once again that this amendment simply says: We condemn such practices. Not only do we condemn them, to the extent that we are able to identify those who are involved in those practices, we are not going to sanction your travel to this country by granting you a visa. 
I don't know how well it can be enforced. I know there are human rights groups out there that monitor what is going on in China. I believe that for government officials, which have an egregious record of religious persecution, that we can identify them when credible information can be brought forward. The Secretary of State can make that determination. And it will send a good and solid signal that this is an important issue to the American people, which would deny them the right to travel to this country. 
Were I permitted to offer an additional amendment that I filed originally back on May 20--a month ago--I would offer it were I able to today. 
It is, once again, one of those amendments that mirrors the language passed by the House of Representatives several months ago by overwhelming bipartisan margins. This particular language passed 354 to 59. I can't offer it today because it has been regarded as controversial. This is what it would do. It would direct the President to instruct the United States representatives to vote against taxpayers' subsidized loans to the People's Republic of China. 
The second thing it would do is, it would require United States directors at United States financial institutions, like the IMF and the World Bank, to vote against concessional loans to the People's Republic of China, and it defines concessional loans this way: as those with highly subsidized interest rates, a grace period for repayment of 5 years or more, and maturities of 20 years or more. 
This is just not something that I offer lightly. I think the facts indicate that the People's Republic of China today has a tremendous infusion of capital, the private sector primarily. In the international sector, they have great infusions of capital. They have an economy that is growing two or three times as fast as the U.S. economy. Given the human rights record of China, it is unconscionable for us to require United States taxpayers to subsidize loans to the People's Republic of China. They have enjoyed ready access to international capital through commercial loans, direct investments, sales of securities, bond sales, and through foreign aid. 
International commercial lending to the People's Republic of China had $49 billion in loans outstanding from private creditors in 1995. Capital is certainly available without the taxpayer subsidizing it. 
Regarding international direct investment to the People's Republic of China, from 1993 through 1995 it totaled $97 billion. In 1996 alone, there was $47 billion directly invested in China securities. The Chinese securities--the aggregate value of outstanding Chinese securities currently held by Chinese nationals and foreign persons is $175 billion. From 1993 to 1995, foreign persons invested over $10 billion in Chinese stocks. 
My point is that there is ample, there is ready, capital available for Chinese economic development. 
International assistance and foreign aid: The People's Republic of China received almost $1 billion in foreign aid grants, and an additional $1.5 billion in technical assistance grants from 1993 through 1995, and in 1995 received $5.5 billion in bilateral assistance loans, including concessional aid and export credits. 
Mr. President, despite China's access to international capital and world financial markets, international financial institutions, which have annually provided it with more than $4 billion in loans in recent years amounting to almost a third of the loan commitments of the Asian Development Bank and 17 percent of the loan approvals by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 1995, we are asked to continue to subsidize these loans to Chinese corporations. 
I think it is time that we cease doing this. China borrows more from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank than any other country in the world, and loan commitments from those institutions to China quadrupled, from $1.1 billion in 1985 to $4.3 billion by 1995. In spite of the fact that you have all of this ready capital available for economic development in China, they are utilizing these subsidized loans at an ever greater rate. 
Mr. President, I believe strongly that America's taxpayer dollars should not be used to create unfair advantages for industry's control by foreign governments. However, when the World Bank lends money to Communist Chinese industries out of its Poverty Fund, that is exactly result that we have. 
I say to my colleagues that these loans are not only contrary to American interests and the purposes of the Poverty Fund, but they are also unnecessary, given Chinese industry's ready access to foreign investment, including $48 billion in loans from private creditors in 1995 and $97 billion in international direct investments from 1993 to 1995, and $10.5 billion in investment in Chinese stocks by foreigners from 1993 to 1995, and billions more in various types of foreign investments. 
I find it inappropriate that the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank loaned China $4.3 billion in both 1995 and 1996, and of the 1995 loan amount, $480 million of it, almost $1/2 billion of it came from the World Bank's poverty fund, its concessional loan affiliate, the International Development Association. As concessional loans, these funds are by definition below market and therefore subsidized by those who fund it--the American taxpayer. 
This amendment will address what I call the `Chinese wall,' the wall that was erected between economic and political considerations. Inherent in the bylaws of international financial institutions are provisions that direct the officers of these institutions to neither interfere in the political affairs of any member nor shall they--and I am quoting from their bylaws, shall not interfere in the `political affairs of any member, nor shall they be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the members or members concerned. Only economic considerations shall be relevant to their decisions.' 
So in the bylaws of these lending institutions, international lending institutions, there is a prohibition from considering the political practices of the applicant. I believe that it is these bylaws that provide a shield behind which numerous international financial institutions continue to provide financing to countries, specifically Communist China, that engage in the most egregious abuses of human rights; so long as they carry out the economic recommendations agreed upon, they can receive the loans. They can continue to receive these subsidized loans. I think that is wrong. I think that should be a consideration, these human rights abuses that are ongoing. 
This amendment clearly states that `repressive and oppressive' regimes should not get a loan. In addition, this amendment clearly sets out substantive principles that should be adhered to by any U.S. national conducting an industrial cooperation project in China. 
In other words, while it is a sense of Congress and is nonbinding, the amendment would lay out certain principles by which American corporations conducting business, industrial cooperation in China should adhere. 
During my time in China and since, and visiting with large American corporations doing business in China, I was continually told that an American presence in China would have the effect of transmitting American values. If we just allow these companies to set up shop, sell their products, or put the components together and export them back to our country, because we have a $50 billion trade imbalance with China, if we will do that, if we will increase trade and allow companies to operate there, the result will be a quicker liberalization and a more rapid democratization of China. 
That is what I have heard for the last 5 years since I came to Congress. I haven't seen it happen. In fact, what I saw was corporate officials who said we have a cozy relationship with Beijing and we have to maintain that cozy relationship in order to do business in China. And so instead of reflecting American values and human rights values and concern about repression and oppression, instead of concern about religious persecution, instead of concern about coerced abortions and American officials standing up and denouncing the Beijing government for these ongoing practices, they say in order to do business over here, we can't say those kinds of things; we can't take those 
kinds of stands, but let us operate and somehow these values, which we hold deep in our heart--but, unfortunately, they are too often hidden--are going to be transmitted. 
And so we would just simply, with a sense of the Congress, lay out some principles that I think are important for American companies to utilize if we are, in fact, to help spark the kind of change that we all want to see in China. 
So we suggest suspending the use of any goods, wares, articles, or merchandise that the U.S. national has reason to believe were mined, produced, or manufactured by convict labor or forced labor, and refuse to use forced labor in the industrial cooperation project. 
Pretty good principle to start with, don't you think, for our companies operating in China to try to monitor better--some of them are doing a good job, some of them are not doing a good job at all, but to try to monitor those products that are coming from slave labor camps and to pledge they will not use those products. 
Secondly, to seek to ensure that political or religious views, sex, ethnic or national background involvement in political activities or nonviolent demonstrations, or association with suspected or known dissidents will not prohibit hiring, lead to harassment, demotion, or dismissal, or in any way affect the status or terms of employment in the industrial cooperation project. 
The second principle of the sense of the Congress would simply say that because somebody spoke out and expressed themselves on a political issue which might be contrary to the party line, they should not be fired or be penalized because of that, not be not allowed to work or have employment. 
Then we suggest that these projects should discourage any Chinese military presence on the premises of any industrial cooperation project which involves dual-use technologies. 
The news accounts this morning which said that China has refused to agree to an agreement to retarget their missiles, 13 of which are currently aimed at American cities, I think underscores the importance of that principle for American companies doing business in China, that we are not going to have a military presence on those premises that involve dual-use technologies. 
And then we suggest that they provide the Department of State with information relevant to the Department's efforts to collect information on prisoners for the purpose of the Prisoner Information Registry. If American companies want to make a difference in operating in China, that is something they can do, help our State Department monitor the human rights abuses that are ongoing. 
And then finally we suggest they should promote freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information on ideas of all kinds. Nonbinding for the private sector but principles, I think, that lay out what our companies should be utilizing in their efforts to work in China. 
Mr. President, this Chinese wall that has prohibited consideration of political practices and human rights abuses must come tumbling down. This amendment would help do that. 
And then if we accept this amendment when it is offered, and I hope we will and I think we will--we should--it will spark a rethinking inside international financial institutions and our own Treasury Department. This rethinking should be based on the United States not wanting to reward repressive 
regimes, countries like China that commit the most egregious of human rights abuses with taxpayer-subsidized loans. 
Our watchwords on this floor have been and should be `freedom and liberty.' Part of those watchwords is that we not reward regimes with concessional loans, subsidized by the American taxpayer, when these kinds of practices continue. So I am going to urge, when I have the opportunity to offer this amendment and have a vote on that amendment, my colleagues to take that stand, not because the President is going to China but because it is the right thing to do, because it was the right thing to do last year when the House of Representatives voted on it. It is the right thing for the Senate to do. 
I wish we could have voted on it on May 20 when I filed the amendment. It in no way is meant to embarrass the President. It is an effort to reflect the values of the American people and, as he takes this trip, to buttress his ability to stand in Tiananmen Square and say, `Congress thinks this is important; the American people believe this is important.' 
Mr. President, if I were able to, I would offer a fourth amendment--I had intended to offer a fourth amendment, and when I have the opportunity, I will. It is an amendment I filed June 16. It also is an amendment that mirrors language that passed overwhelmingly on the floor of the House of Representatives. The vote was 401 to 21--401 to 21. It would authorize an appropriation of $22 million for Radio Free Asia and Voice of America for fiscal year 1999. This amendment was deemed controversial, but it passed 401 to 121. It would authorize $22 million for Radio Free Asia and Voice of America. 
The President's fiscal year 1999 budget request for Radio Free Asia was $19.4 million. This amendment would surpass the President's request by almost $3 million. Radio Free Asia funding comes out of the United States Information Agency, which is a related agency of the State Department. It is funded through the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. 
The second thing the amendment would do would be to facilitate a 24-hour-a-day broadcast to China in the Mandarin, Cantonese, and Tibetan dialects as well as other major dialects, including those spoken in Xinjiang. 
Let's put that chart up. 
Additional funding for RFA, Radio Free Asia, would also facilitate construction of transmitters in the Mariana Islands and accelerate the improvements to the Tinian Island transmitters so they will be completed by June 30, 1998, instead of January 1, 1999. 
This map of China is pockmarked with little orange labels. Each one of those orange labels represents a location in China in which the citizens of China have managed to get correspondence out to Radio Free Asia, expressing their appreciation for the work that Radio Free Asia does. The greatest tool that we have in bringing about change in China is to get the truth, to get the message of democracy and freedom, in to the Chinese people. This amendment will be a step toward doing that. 
If passed, it will assist with the creation of a Cantonese language service with 16 journalists, including 3 based in Hong Kong and 2 roving between the United States and east Asia. The amendment would require the President to report on a plan to achieve continuous broadcasting in Asia within 90 days. 
I believe this is a simple amendment to understand. It encourages freedom in China, which we all want--freedom in China. We disagree sometimes on methods and strategies, we see different ways to achieve it, but I do believe all my colleagues in the U.S. Senate want to see a free China. 
I want to say to my colleagues, we should all agree also that reaching Chinese listeners in all dialects, encouraging the free flow of information, can and will serve as the greatest means by which we can get the truth into China. It will be the surrogate media; it will be the substitute for the absent free media in Communist China today. 
A fundamental prerequisite to political and economic freedom is an informed citizen. However, the Communist Chinese Government has accordingly made censorship and control of information available to its citizens its top priority. The Communist Chinese Government maintains control by simply not letting the people know. It is getting harder and harder to do, because of the Internet and other means of international communications, but they go to great lengths to keep the Chinese people from knowing the truth. Radio Free Asia plays a fundamental role, a vital role, in getting the truth in to the citizens of China. This amendment will help to make that a priority. 
In addition to China's traditional methods--controlling the media, suffocating secrecy, and misinformation, massive use of wiretapping, informants, and other forms of surveillance to restrict private sources of accurate information--the regime is building an infrastructure for Internet use that will permit the state to filter and monitor information on this freest communication media. It is a perfect example of the priority Communist China places on the political control over economic development. The New China News Agency even censors commercial news from Dow Jones and Reuters. 
The United States still supports the free flow of information around the globe. This is one means by which we can underscore that. That is what this amendment does. In fact, people now free of communism's grip on the now-defunct Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact attest to the role that Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty played as surrogate news services in these countries. These relatively inexpensive, independently run news 
services served as the best substitute for the free media that was absent in the old Soviet Union. Similarly, Radio Free Asia provides cost-effective surrogate services to permit the free flow of information to the Chinese people. 
I have come down to this floor time and time again to explain why I believe this administration's policy toward China is misguided. I do not favor a policy of isolation; I favor a policy of true engagement; I fear this administration's policy has not been one of engagement; it has been one of appeasement. We have not engaged them on human rights, we have not engaged them on national security, we really haven't engaged them on trade, because we have a $50 billion trade deficit with this Government. But while I have many disagreements with the President, I applaud his recent remarks concerning Radio Free Asia at the National Geographic Society in a speech last week, I believe it was. In the President's own words, the President said this:  
I have told President Jiang that when it comes to human rights and religious freedom, China remains on the wrong side of history. . . . In support of that message, we are strengthening Radio Free Asia. 
It needs to be strengthened. I appreciate the President saying that, and I believe, because of that, he would be glad to support this amendment. I applaud his words, because Radio Free Asia is broadcasting under the banner of truthful information to the lingering Communist lands--specifically, China--and it has been too often underfinanced by this Congress, they have been undermanned, and they have been overworked. 
I believe that Radio Free Asia's mission is to do for Asia what Radio Free Europe did for Eastern Europe. That mission is to broadcast the truthful information to countries where the Communist governments ban all free expression by their so-called domestic news services. The mission of Radio Free Asia is simply to replicate the kind of radio services, in the Communist countries it targets, that those Communist countries would have, were they really free countries, were the government to allow it, were there not government censorship. 
I live in northwest Arkansas. The population in Benton and in Washington Counties in northwest Arkansas is probably 250,000 people. In those two counties we have over 20 independently-owned radio stations; population 250,000. I was in the radio business. I got out because that is too competitive--20 radio stations with 250,000 people--but that is the free market. That is the right of every American, every entrepreneur--to go out and scrape and take a loan out, if need be, apply with the FCC, get a license, get a building permit, build that tower, and start a radio station. That is what we did, from ground up. We have 20 radio stations now in that two-county area. 
When I was in Beijing in January--Beijing, China, one of the largest cities population-wise in the world--there was not one independent, free, operating radio station. That says about all that needs to be said about whether China is really making progress, whether China is on the right side of history. The President was right, they are on the wrong side of history. In all of Beijing, not one independent newspaper. I get mad at the newspapers sometimes in Arkansas. They say things I don't like, or they take a position I don't agree with. Boy, when I look at the alternative, when I look at China today and I think about a city in which all of the newspapers are controlled by the Government, I thank God for that free press. Radio Free Asia, increasing the funds, providing them the resources, ensuring that they are going to be broadcasting in all of the dialects in China and broadcasting around the clock, is the best single step that we can take to bring about the wanted change in China. 
Mr. President, current U.S.-China policies have been debated, are being debated, and will continue to be debated by this Congress. Members on both sides of the aisle differ on the best paths and avenues to promote and secure freedom and liberty for the Chinese people, but this amendment, although it has been called controversial this morning, although I have not been allowed to offer it this morning, even though the vote would occur next week, this amendment is not controversial. This amendment simply says the greatest means we have of changing China is to get information in. 
The amendment is not pro-China or anti-China. The amendment is pro-freedom. I am perplexed that we cannot offer it today. The Senate, the Congress, the President, the American people need to send a clear message to China and other Communist countries that the U.S. Congress will take all necessary steps to ensure that freedom has a chance to blossom. 
I am bothered, frankly, that as we have seen the preparations for the President's trip, it has become a microcosm of the broader China policy. Originally, the President wanted to go to China in November. China said, `We want you to come in June.' That is the anniversary, the ninth anniversary, of the Tiananmen massacre, when hundreds of unarmed, innocent democracy protesters were gunned down by the Chinese Government. And the Chinese Government says, `We want you, Mr. President, to come in June.' The President agreed. 
The President originally was going to stop in Japan on this trip, but the Chinese Communist Government objected: `We don't want you to stop in Japan, we don't want you to stop anywhere, because President Jiang, when he went to the United States, went directly to the United States; that is exactly what we want you to do because we are equals.' The President said, `OK, we won't stop in Japan, we'll make a direct trip.' 
The President originally was going to have a shorter trip. The Chinese Government said, `President Jiang stayed 9 days in the United States, and we want a 9-day visit to China.' We don't want to embarrass, we don't want a loss of face, so we conceded, we acquiesced.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. If the Senator will yield, I will respond to the Senator from Virginia. I only became aware only as you speak that there were bipartisan objections. Earlier today, on the other side of the aisle there were objections to bringing these amendments up today. I might add, these amendments were filed a month ago. As I spoke to the majority leader earlier this week, he was aware and it has been publicly reported these amendments were going to be offered to the DOD authorization. 
The majority leader encouraged me to stay on Friday so I would be able to offer these amendments earlier as opposed to later. He encouraged me not to wait until Monday or Tuesday in the debate, but offer them today, Friday. It was my plan not to return to my home State so I would be able to offer these amendments today. 
I am now aware there are objections, perplexing to me, obviously, because they passed by such margins in the House. Yes, I am aware there are objections. I am certainly no less committed to ensuring that these amendments will be debated and will be voted on. I think they are greatly important, and I think they are germane, and I think they are appropriate. I intend, when given the opportunity, to press for debate and for a vote.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today represents the ninth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. This is the day that commemorates the culmination of the crackdown--very bloody crackdown--that occurred 9 years ago in Beijing, China. 
I think it would be wrong for us not to take note of that on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I think it is incumbent upon all of us, as freedom-loving Americans, to not forget the lessons that we continue to learn from China. 
I would like to, in the next few minutes, read an excerpt from a book entitled `Mandate of Heaven: The Legacy of Tiananmen Square,' by Orville Schell. This book recounts, among other things, what occurred during the 2 months leading up to the Tiananmen Square massacre and the events that night. I have taken only a few excerpts from that, but I think it will help us to put into perspective the sacrifices that were made, the tragedy that occurred, and I think the tragedy of American foreign policy which today ignores that it was, in fact, Jiang Zemin, mayor of Shanghai at the time, who said that there should not be one ounce of forgiveness shown to those student protesters who dared raise the voice of dissent, who dared to speak for freedom and democracy in China. So I will read from `Mandate of Heaven: The Legacy of Tiananmen Square': 
Although a palpable sense of foreboding hung over the Square, few could bring themselves to believe that the People's Liberation Army might actually harm `the people.' Not even under the vindictive Gang of Four had troops opened fire with tens of thousands of demonstrators had spontaneously occupied the Square to mourn the death of Zhou Enlai in 1976. So many ominous-sounding government threats had come to naught since April 15 that most ordinary Chinese were now inclined to view this latest salvo of warnings as more overinflated rhetoric. The triumphs, symbolic and otherwise, of the preceding weeks had given many, especially protesters, an exaggerated sense of their own invincibility. 
But there were some Chinese who understood that when threatened, the Party would ultimately stop at nothing to preserve its grip on power. They understood the old adage `When scholars confront soldiers, it is impossible to speak with reason.' Most of these pessimists were from the older generation of educated Chinese who had learned through bitter experience that the Party rarely allowed such challenges to go unconfronted. `The Day the Soldiers Enter the City, Then the Blood of the People will Flow,' declared one banner . . . 
Around dusk the Flying Tigers began bringing back reports that soldiers equipped with automatic weapons and backed up by armored vehicles were moving toward the city center from several directions at once. In response, the strengthening of barricades reached fever pitch. By the time the first troops neared key intersections on the city's outskirts, an estimated 2 million people were again in the streets. At first, these citizens' brigades continued to rely on the same defensive techniques that they had used two weeks earlier, and by dark, many unarmed units were again bottled up around the city . . . 
By 10 p.m. the assault from the west was in full swing. As several infantry and armored divisions pushed toward the Military Museum, they soon found their way blocked by a wall of angry citizens and Dare-to-Die squads of workers pledged to defend the students and the Square until death. The juggernaut of military vehicles ground to a halt, allowing government propaganda to cite these instances of hesitation as evidence that the army had exercised a `high degree of restraint' while entering the city. Such `restraint' did not last long. 
The next volley of gunfire was aimed over the heads of the resisters. The crowd refused to disperse. Finally, an officer in a jeep was reported to have yelled out through a megaphone, `Charge, you bunch of cowards! Sweep away this trash!' A volley of concussion grenades was lobbed into the crowd. Only when steel-helmeted soldiers carrying truncheons and riot shields were ordered to charge did those resisting give way. 
It was around 11 p.m. before advancing troops approached Muxidi Bridge near the state guesthouse. By then the order to `go ahead at any cost' and to shoot at anyone obstructing the soldiers' path had been given. Before soldiers had even arrived at the giant barricade constructed out of articulated city buses, large earthmoving trucks, commandeered minivans, and tons of urban detritus, the first wounded were being rushed on bicycle carts to hospitals. As troops approached the bridge, someone torched the fuel tank of a bus, turning the barricade into a raging wall of fire. The column had no choice but to halt. With Gallic flair, Pierre Hurel, a French journalist writing for Paris Match, described the scene: 
`In front of the flaming barricade, facing the soldiers alone, four students with their feet planted wide apart make the heavy air snap with the sound of the waving scarlet banners. In an unbelievable gesture of defiance, they are naked martyrs before a sea of soldiers in brown combat helmets and tense with anger. The silk of their university banners gleams in the fire's light, and behind them a crowd, waiting for the worst, applauds. it is 11:30 p.m. and for the first time tonight, the soldiers have had to pull back.' 
As the convey began pushing forward again a short while later, a noise resembling the sound of popcorn popping was suddenly heard over the dim of the crowd. Out of the smoky darkness, troops armed with AK-47s charged the barricades, shooting as they advanced. 
`Soldiers were shooting indiscriminately; there were bullets flying everywhere; dead bodies and injured people were lying in the streets,' reported one anonymous foreign journalist cited in a subsequent Amnesty International report. `Crowds of residents from the neighboring lanes had left their houses and stood unprotected in the streets. They did not try to hide because they did not seem to realize what was going on. They were in a state of shock and disbelief.' 
All along the Avenue of Eternal Peace, equally ferocious battles broke out as citizens stood their ground with an almost religious fanaticism before advancing troops. Bystanders who ran into surrounding alleyways for safety were chased down and sprayed with automatic-weapons fire. Those who tried to rescue the wounded were shot in cold blood. The slaughter was so merciless that rumors began circulating that the soldiers had been administered some kind of drug as a stimulant. 
By 1 a.m. soldiers had neared the intersection where Xidan crosses the Avenue of Eternal Peace and began lobbying tear-gas canisters into the crowds. Moments later several buses serving as barricades burst into flames. Then another order to fire was given. `Several lines of students and residents instantly fell,' claimed one BASF eyewitness. `Dozens were killed, and several hundred were wounded.' 
Yang Jianli, a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics from the University of California at Berkeley who was back in China on a visit, watched in horror as these shock troops advanced, firing their automatic weapons as if they were assaulting a heavily armed enemy position. `Tanks and truckloads of soldiers armed with machine guns were rolling in, one after another, toward the Square,' he remembered. `At the intersection we heard perhaps a thousand people shouting, `Down with Fascism!' . . . [Then] flashes spouted from the muzzles of soldiers' rifles. We ran back a bit and threw ourselves on the pavement. `Did they really fire?' I asked H. `I still can't believe it!' Some people continued to stand up, saying nonchalantly, `Don't be frightened, they're only using rubber bullets.' But before they had finished speaking I heard someone scream, `Look out! There's a cart coming through!' Two men with gunshot wounds were being carried away. . . . Suddenly, there was more gunfire, and we dropped to the ground again, my heart jumping from sheer fright.' 
`His blue T-shirt was soaked with blood, and his eyes were blood-red,' recalled Yang of one outraged citizen. . . . 
`Troops have been firing indiscriminately and still people would not move back,' BBC News Chief Correspondent Kate Adie reported in a television broadcast after visiting both the western and eastern reaches of the Avenue of Eternal Peace. `Indeed, it was hard at the time to grasp that this army was launching into an unarmed civilian population as if charging into battle. . . . There was not one voice on the streets that did not express despair and rage. `Tell the world!' they said to us.' 
Since that 1989 tragedy and this famous photo of a lone student who stood defiantly in front of the line of tanks, there has been every June 4th efforts within China, efforts there at Tiananmen, to remind the world of the tragedy that occurred, of those brutal, visible oppressions, and forcibly removing a voice of freedom that the world has known in generations. 
I continue from Schell's book as he recounts some of the symbolic gestures that have been made since that original June 4th, 1989. 
He writes: 
`Like an uninterred body, June 4th continued to cry out for an appropriate and respectable barrier.' 
There are those, if I might just add, who would like to say we are in a post-Tiananmen era but somehow that chapter has been closed. The fact is the Communist Chinese government in China does not allow that chapter to be closed. So Schell refers to it as an uninterred body which continued to cry out for appropriate and respectable barrier.  
The yearning that many continued to feel for some sort of commemoration could never be fulfilled by parades or crimson stars fashioned out of potted flowers. But since the government stubbornly refused to acknowledge the tragic significance of what had happened, much less allow for a ceremony at which those who had died could be properly remembered, the Square remained charged with unresolved energy and, like a lodestone, kept drawing defiant demonstrators back into its embrace to engage in solitary acts of guerrilla mourning. 
Such observances were, or course, politically suicidal. As soon as anyone began such a ritual protest, plainclothes policemen materialized as if out of nowhere. Within moments the offenders were surrounded, seized, and dragged away. Only on those rare occasions when foreign journalists had been alerted in advance or happened to be at the Square for other reasons were such fleeting moments of defiance recorded. But then, like shooting stars in the night sky, these usually nameless protesters would disappear. 
He writes: 
On the first anniversary of June 4, a lone figure had walked up to the Monument and nervously fumbled to display a handmade banner; moments later he was seized and taken away. That night [at the university], a young economics student named Li Minqui, who had been active in the outlawed BASF, tried to mark the anniversary by addressing a spontaneous midnight rally on campus where he indignantly referred to China's current leaders as `wild and savage autocrats' and called for an elective Government that could supervise the Communist party. Li was not only promptly expelled but arrested, labeled a `chief instigator of an anti-party conspiracy,' accused of counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement,' and sentenced to 2 years in prison. 
I just think of how many Members of the Senate and how many Members of the Congress would be incarcerated if that were the standard. This one who dared to lift a voice to say we ought to have free elections and called the autocrats `wild and savage" served 2 years. 
Schell continues to write: 
On the second anniversary of the massacre, a young woman dressed in funeral white appeared in front of the Monument to observe a moment of silence. `I came to remember,' she told a South China Morning Post correspondent before drifting away just as suspicious undercover agents began to close in. 
Incidentally, white being the symbolic color of mourning in China, we have chosen the white color, white ribbons to commemorate in mourning those who lost their lives at Tiananmen Square. So that is what happened on the second anniversary. 
And then Schell writes: 
In 1992, on the third anniversary of the massacre, a young worker named Wang Wanxing appeared not far from where a new sign warned visitors that it was illegal to lay memorial wreaths in front of the Monument without prior approval. After unfurling a banner calling on Deng to apologize for the crackdown following the protest, he was seized, dragged away and committed to a mental hospital. In a letter to U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali smuggled out of China a month later Wang asserted that not only was he being held against his will in Shanghai's Ankang Psychiatric Hospital for the criminally insane, but he was being forced to take psychotropic drugs. 
Computer hackers were also busy that spring waging electronic warfare by introducing rogue viruses into software programs used on government computers. One such virus caused the words `Remember June 4' to appear on display terminals while another flashed the slogan `Bloody June 4' as soon as computers at certain state enterprises were booted up. 
Despite increased campus surveillance, on May 28, 1991, [university] students managed to hang cloth streamers out of two dorm windows declaring `We Will Never Forget June 4.' Leaflets recalling the events of 1989 also appeared in the student canteen. 
An excerpt from the leaflets said this: 
Those were days that woke the heart and moved the spirit. Then the hue and cry became the sound of suffocation in a pool of blood. 
There are those who would say that to call the world's attention to the tragedy of Tiananmen Square in 1989 is empty moralizing on the part of self-righteous Americans who want to impose our views of freedom and liberty upon the rest of the world and other cultures. May I say to those who would argue such that liberty and freedom are not American values, that it is not empty moralizing to point to a young Chinese student who defied the symbols of oppression and onrushing tanks. And I would say to those who would say don't talk about Tiananmen Square and don't talk about the massacre, we must not forget that these are not American values: these are universal human values and human rights. For us to sacrifice what this Nation has always stood for on the altar of free trade, on the altar of commercial and corporate profits is unconscionable. 
Jiang Zemin was quoted on the front page of the People's Daily 3 weeks after the massacre. This is what he said. He was mayor of Shanghai at the time, not President of China. But this is what he said: 
Toward these cruel enemies-- 
That is that young man standing in front of the tanks-- there must not be even one percent of forgiveness. If we go easy on them, we shall commit an error of historic proportions. 
That is the man whom the President is going to meet and greet in Beijing in a few short weeks, the one who said that toward these cruel enemies we dare not show even one percent of 
forgiveness. And they didn't, true to his word. 
Nine years later, Jiang is President of China and the students whom he called the cruel enemies, many remain imprisoned, those who survived. And Jiang, true to his word, showed not 1 percent of forgiveness. He has never apologized. He has never acknowledged the cruel, inhumane, and barbaric response of the Government at Tiananmen Square. The Chinese Government has never investigated, they have never even investigated this tragic incident; they have only defended the crackdown and the killing of hundreds of students as an appropriate response to peaceful dissent. 
So this man, Jiang Zemin will be the leader greeting our President, this man who declared not 1 percent of forgiveness. And more recently, lest you think he may have changed his mind and changed his attitude and lest we are under the misimpression that suddenly the Government of China has grown compassionate and that, in the words of President Clinton, they now are becoming a thriving democracy--lest we think that, President Jiang, when asked by Barbara Walters how he looked back on the events of 1989, replied, `It's much ado about nothing.' 
So on this anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre, we all need to remind the world we will not forget and we will not allow the courageous sacrifice of those hundreds of students at Tiananmen Square to be demeaned, to be disrespected and to be devalued. 
The Washington Post, in an editorial today entitled `China: Two Views,' speaks of a view that I would share: 
A strikingly different view from inside China, from someone with pretty fair credentials to judge China's practices, Bao Tong, 65, was Chief of Staff of China's premier and Communist Party chief until he was jailed in 1989. 
Why was he jailed, by the way? He was jailed: 
Because he opposed the crackdown against protesting students in Tiananmen Square. Mr. Bao spent 7 years in prison, three of them incommunicado, showing that China has a ways to go when it comes to rule of law. He now lives under house arrest but recently gave an interview to the Post's Steven Mufson and John Pomfret. 
Mr. Bao challenged the notion that economic strength, in the absence of real democratization, inevitably will make China more benign. 
By the way, let me repeat what he challenged, because it is the very thesis espoused by those who say constructive engagement is going to bring about change in China. This is the very theory espoused by those who say, `We will just trade sufficiently, we will increase trade and do enough increased commerce with China, and everything will be better.' So he challenged the notion that economic strength in the absence of real democratization inevitably will lead China to be more benign.  
China `has already gone mad twice in the last 40 years,' he said, referring to the cultural revolution and the Tiananmen massacre. `You have to ask yourself a question. What will it do on the international scene? Is it a source of stability or a potential source of instability? When it doesn't have enough power, its attitude will be restrained. But once it develops and becomes strong, what kind of role is it going to play without a complete structural change?' 
That is the question I would pose. For all of the advocates of the current administration's policy, I would pose this question raised by this very knowledgeable individual, Mr. Bao, who himself has spent 7 years incarcerated. The question he poses: Once China develops, opens, and becomes strong, what kind of role is it going to play without a complete structural change? 
What he means by `complete structural change' is democratization. It is his argument that economic development in China, the embrace of free markets, and the embrace of market capitalism will not be sufficient to make them benign, to make them a partner in world peace, and that that will not happen without a structural change--free elections, freedom of press, freedom of speech, freedom of religion--that until those things become realities in China, then we cannot expect that there are going to be responsible citizens in the international stage of affairs. 
The Post editorial concludes: 
Mr. Clinton should meet with dissidents when he visits Beijing later this month. A sit-down with Bao Tong, if the government would release him from house arrest long enough, might be a useful addition to the president's official schedule. 
And I suggest it certainly would. 
So I want to conclude on this anniversary of an event that should never, never, never be forgotten, by making this plea: Mr. President, delay your trip to China. There are ongoing investigations; there are ongoing hearings. So, please, we are not talking about isolating China. It could not happen if we wanted it to. We are not talking about breaking off contacts, dialog and communications with China. But we are saying, under the current cloud and with all of the questions about the web of interrelationships between the Chinese Government, the American administration, and corporate America and multinational corporations--delay this trip. 
Then second, Mr. President, if you must go, if you must go ahead with this planned trip, then I plead with you to express the desire of millions of Americans by not going and not being received at Tiananmen. As this young man took his stand as a symbol of freedom against the symbols of oppression, I ask our President, take one small stand by not going to Tiananmen Square; not being received, simply saying: Mr. Jiang Zemin, I will not be received where these students were slain. I will not show disrespect and disdain for the sacrifice that they made by being received at a State visit on that location. To be received there is to demean and devalue the stand those students took. 
Third, I plead with you, Mr. President, that if you insist on going to China, that you should insist on meeting with the families of those champions of democracy who were either slain or remain in prison. I ask that as our President goes, and if he goes, that he should forcefully denounce the repression and the human rights abuses ongoing in China; if he goes to Tiananmen Square that his message should be this: Never again. And in the spirit of Ronald Reagan at the Berlin Wall, let him say, `This is wrong. Never should it happen again.' I ask that in China he visit with house church leaders, those who, because of their conscience and because of their religious convictions, have not registered with the Communist Chinese Government and, because they have not registered, because they have not signed up and received official sanction by the Government, stand in harm's way, stand in jeopardy of losing their freedom. 
I ask that our President visit with banned journalists, for there are no free newspapers. There are no independent journalists. There are no expressions of dissent against the Communist Chinese Government. So, Mr. President, meet with those journalists who would like to have a newspaper, who would like to be able to write a column, who would like to be able to freely express their views of freedom and democracy, but are not allowed to because of the current regime. Meet with them. Hear their story. Take your stand for freedom. 
And then I ask that before you leave for Beijing, if you must go, that you sign the China sanctions package that has already passed the House of Representatives by a huge, overwhelming bipartisan majority. Some of those provisions have already been added to our State Department authorization bill which we will be debating, hopefully, next week. Some of those have already been set. But I ask that the President sign those 
and, in so doing, express sincerity in wanting to decry the human rights abuses that are going on. 
Let me just conclude. In a Washington Post article, not an editorial but a news article today on the Tiananmen anniversary, the article, a Michael Laris report, concludes: 
. . . China has not yet turned irrevocably toward a liberal political approach. [That's an understatement.] It maintains a massive state security apparatus, which monitors the private affairs of anybody it deems a threat to the Communist Party's monopoly on political power. The jails hold more than 2,000 political prisoners, including 150 or so arrested after the Tiananmen Square protests. Among the 200,000 other people in labor camps, at least some are political offenders. 
[I assume yesterday] Early this evening at the Beijing University bulletin board, which was a center of protest information in 1989, a woman read announcements of lectures on the environment and the Asian financial crisis. `Many of my friends think those students were foolish,' she [this student] said. `I think they were very brave. I wish more people now had that much passion. Some people now have the same passion, but they know not to express it in the same way.' 
For those who believe it is all better now in China, listen to the words of this student who says the students in China today have learned, passion for freedom they may have, but if they cherish being free, if they cherish the right to be a student, if they don't want to be incarcerated, they better not express it as these students did 9 years ago today. 
So to all freedom-loving Americans--not as Republicans and not as Democrats--but to all freedom-loving Americans, we say to those Chinese who love freedom as well: We will not forget what happened June 4, 1989. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. If the Senator will yield for one final question, as I listened to his comments, they reflected my own feelings--his concern about low-income Americans. It struck me that those who have professed to be the greatest defenders of the poor are those who seem to be the proponents of this massive tax increase upon working poor Americans. But the Earned-Income Tax Credit Program is a program designed to assist those who are working Americans, low-income working Americans, to prevent them from falling into dependency and being on the welfare system. 
Is there anything in this base bill that would, in a sense, compensate those low-income working Americans who are going to see this very confiscatory tax imposed upon them through this dramatic increase in the price of cigarettes, to assist them in reforming the EITC Program or in some way offsetting these additional taxes that they will be paying? Or is this an absolute, real loss of consumable income for those who are most poor in our society?

<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, last week the Senate, by adopting two of the remaining eight House-passed China provisions, I believe took an important first step in reversing this Nation's failed, flawed and counterproductive policy of so-called `constructive engagement' with the People's Republic of China. 
The first amendment we adopted last week, an amendment to the Defense Department authorization bill, requires the Department of Defense to monitor enterprises which are owned by the People's Liberation Army and gives the President increased authority to take action against these companies should circumstances warrant. It does not mandate the President to act, but it would give him enhanced authority to act should the evidence warrant it. 
The second amendment we adopted gives the U.S. Customs Service increased funding and authority to stop the importation of goods produced in Chinese slave labor camps. The importation of goods produced by slave labor has been prohibited in this country for half a century, and yet the practice is continuing, unfortunately, and thus, this enhanced monitoring and enhanced authority for the Customs Service is essential. 
These were two very, very important amendments, I believe, but there are six bills still remaining in the Foreign Relations Committee. I believe the Foreign Relations Committee will be taking those bills up tomorrow. I hope they will. But the votes that we cast last week could not possibly have been more timely. Their importance is best seen by new information uncovered last Friday by the New York Times, one day after we cast those two important votes on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
That story, covered by the New York Times, and now by every major newspaper in the country, revealed that Johnny Chung, the central figure in the Justice Department's campaign finance investigation, has now told investigators that a large part of the nearly $100,000 that he gave to the DNC and to other Democratic causes in the summer of 1996 came from the People's Liberation Army of the People's Republic of China. 
Let me say that again. A large part of the $100,000--in fact, $80,000 of it--went to the DNC, and that money came from the Chinese Red army. This was the front-page story in the New York Times on Friday, May 15. Then inside the newspaper the headline is: `Fund-raiser is Said to Tell of Donations from China Military to Democrats.' 
This is a very, very serious allegation that Mr. Chung has made in his cooperation with the Justice Department alleging that this money came not just from Chinese sources, but came from the Chinese Red military. Worse yet, this was no low-level PLA effort. It wasn't low-level figures in the People's Liberation Army, but according to Chung, these monies were provided by a Chinese lieutenant colonel and aerospace executive whose father, General Liu, was at the time China's top military commander and a member of the leadership of China's Communist Party. 
This reaches to the very top echelon of the Chinese Government and to the very top levels of the PLA command system. Their very top leadership apparently hatched, planned, and carried out this so-called `China plan.' 
Let us not forget, Mr. President, that this whole investigation was started after an interception of a telephone communication suggesting that the People's Republic of China was considering a covert plan to influence United States elections. It would now appear that this so-called `China plan' was actually carried out by the top leadership of the PLA and the Communist Party. 
Why would China and the PLA want to influence American elections? What motive would they have to pick and choose winners 
and losers in our own Presidential sweepstakes? The answer appears to be given in this very same New York Times article: 
At the time (of these payments from the PLA), President Clinton was making it easier for American civilian communications satellites to be launched by Chinese rockets, a key issue for the PLA and for Liu's company, which sells missiles for the military and also has a troubled space subsidiary. 
There was a very, very vested interest by Lieutenant Colonel Liu in ensuring that Chinese rockets would be able to launch American satellites. Thus, while the DNC and the Democratic Party was being flooded with money from the head of the PLA, the head of the Democratic Party, President Clinton, was making it easier for the PLA to receive advanced technological support for its missile and space programs. The only question left to be answered seems to be, was it a quid pro quo? 
To put the harmful effects of this `missiles for money" trade into context, or more appropriate, the `PLA Gate,' it is important to note that until last year, China lacked the intelligence or technologies necessary to manufacture boosters that could reliably strike such long distances. This made China a weaker adversary. 
In fact, in a debate that I had on the campus of the University of Mississippi at Oxford, a Firing Line debate that was carried nationwide by public television, Dr. Kissinger made this statement:  
I also do not believe that it is possible to argue that China can represent a military threat to the United States for the next 20 years. 
I remember very vividly Secretary Kissinger making that statement. He almost ridiculed and disdainfully dismissed those who said that China could pose a military threat to the United States at any time in the next two decades. That is a direct quote from the Firing Line transcript. 
My how time flies, because now we find, less than a year later, that all but five of the Chinese nuclear missiles are aimed and directed at the United States and, in fact, they do pose a threat. According to this article in the Washington Times, China targets nukes at the United States, according to a CIA report that was recently released. China now appears to pose a very real threat to the United States. This article noted that 13 of China's 18 long-range strategic missiles with ranges exceeding 8,000 miles and have single nuclear warheads are aimed at the United States. These missiles are in addition to China's growing arsenal of other weapons that can now reach the United States, many of which are mentioned in this article regarding the CIA report. 
How could one of this country's leading China experts and most respected foreign policy adviser have been so far off when Secretary Kissinger said it would take two decades? Like those of us in the Senate, Dr. Kissinger may not have known that two U.S. companies, Loral Space and Communications and Hughes Electronic, illegally gave China space expertise during cooperation on a commercial satellite launch which could be used to develop an accurate launch and guidance system for ICBMs. 
I am sure Dr. Kissinger would not have foreseen that this administration, in the middle of investigating this illegal transfer, would allow Loral to launch another satellite on a Chinese rocket and provide them the same expertise at issue in the criminal case. Nor is it likely that Dr. Kissinger would know that Motorola, under a waiver from this administration, has also been involved in `upgrading' China's missile capability, this according to the chairman of the House Science Subcommittee on Space and Technology. 
The New York Times ran a follow-up article today providing some insight into this administration's policy on China and the transfer of sensitive technology. According to the article that appeared today in the New York Times, United States and China industry groups urged that satellite technology be taken off the list of banned exports, known as the munitions list. 
The State Department sided with the Defense Department and the intelligence agencies, and the President's key advisers and noted that satellite technology holds secrets that hold `significant military and intelligence' information and thus should remain banned for export. 
That was the position of key advisers to the President. That was the position of the Department of State and the Defense Department. The Clinton administration, though, sided with business groups and transferred this decision away from the State Department and left the decision up to the Commerce Department, which was then headed by his close friend, Ron Brown. In the end, satellite technology was removed from the munitions list. China was free to negotiate with U.S. businesses to obtain assistance with its space program. 
The People's Liberation Army is engaged in a massive military buildup which has involved a doubling since 1992 of announced official figures for military spending by the People's Republic of China. This is incredible. It is amazing that we would at this time be circumventing our own ban on technology transfers and the launching of American satellites and the sharing of that valuable, valuable missile technology at the very time we see this massive military buildup. 
The PLA is working to coproduce the SU-27 fighter with Russia. It is in the process of purchasing several substantial weapons systems from the Republic of Russia, including the 633 model of the Kilo-class submarine and the SS-N-22 Sunburn missile system specifically designed to incapacitate United States aircraft carriers and Aegis cruisers. 
Mr. President, this increasingly aggressive military, the PLA, which cracked down on its own citizens in Tiananmen Square, killing over 2,000 Chinese students, that we are aware of, which held threatening war games off the coast of Taiwan, closing two of its largest ports, which has taken over disputed islands once claimed by the Philippines, which now has all but five of its long-range nuclear missiles pointed at the citizens of the United States, is being coddled, pampered and pandered to and appeased by this administration. 
The gross irony here is that while the administration continues to allow the transfer of technology to China and the PLA, the People's Liberation Army, U.S. consumers are unwittingly funding China's military by purchasing items sold by PLA-owned enterprises operating in the United States. 
The PLA operates literally thousands and thousands of businesses. It is unlike any other military in the world. It is not just funded from the general revenue of the Chinese budget, the Chinese Government budget. It rather is funded partially through enterprises and business operations by the military itself. It is estimated that the PLA earns between $2 billion and $4 billion annually through the many enterprises that it operates that deal in nonmilitary commodities, and that these enterprises profit handsomely from their activities right here in the United States of America. 
A report released earlier this year indicated that vast quantities of goods, as varied as toys, ski gloves, garlic, iron weight sets, men's pants, car radiators, glassware, swimsuits, and much more, are being sold to U.S. consumers by PLA-owned firms and almost always without the knowledge of the American consumer. 
Mr. President, this country was shocked last week by India's explosion into the nuclear family. We were all dismayed that a new threat to world security loomed on the horizon in India's completed nuclear tests. Why? Why would a country suffering from rampant poverty and class instability choose to spend its limited and valuable resources on a new nuclear weapon's program? The answer, I believe, lies in the failed policies of this administration. 
It was just over 35 years ago that China last invaded India in an attempt to take over disputed territory. Since that time, there has been an uneasy and often hostile relationship between India and China, its larger neighbor to the north. 
In addition to China's own military buildup, China was assisting other enemies of India in the development of their own nuclear and military capabilities, particularly the nation of Pakistan. In fact, the People's Liberation Army transferred technology relevant to the refinement of weapons-grade nuclear material, including the transfer of ring magnets, to the nation of Pakistan. 
Mr. President, as this country moves closer to China, as we continue to assist its military machine, as we continue to turn a blind eye to China's transfer of technology to Pakistan, why would we be surprised that India would move to arm itself with nuclear weapons? Why are we surprised that a country that is surrounded by a much larger and better armed neighbor, that that nation would develop a defense similar to our own policy of `mutually assured destruction,' a policy that prevailed during the cold war? Mr. President, it was U.S. policy that led to these tragic, sad developments in that entire arena in the world. 
With all but five of China's long-range nuclear missiles pointed at the citizens of the United States, it is obvious that the increasingly aggressive People's Liberation Army views the United States as its most serious adversary. 
It is a sad paradox that U.S. consumers are unwittingly 
funding the military that has their hand on the nuclear buttons which threaten our very existence and that our leadership is accepting money in return for relaxed controls on the transfer of military technology, or at least that is the allegation that has been made. That is the source and the subject of the investigation that is ongoing. 
Not only is China an increasing threat internationally, but within their borders they continue to oppress their own people. The latest State Department report on human rights, to which I have referred repeatedly, says and shows that China is still a major offender of internationally recognized human rights. You pick the category, whether it is coerced abortion, the so-called one-child policy, whether it is slave labor and the refusal to allow international inspection teams to go in and look at these slave labor camps, whether it is the repression of all free expression or criticism of the Government, or whether it is other forms of human rights abuses like the repression of freedom to worship by religious minorities in China, you pick the category, and you will find that there is an absolute intolerance of freedom and that these ongoing abuses show us that they have not made progress under the current policy. 
According to a recent report in the Washington Post entitled, `U.S.-China Talks Make Little Progress on Summit Agenda,' we find that the United States is getting very few concessions from China relating to the inspection of the technology that we share with them. We are getting very few concessions on limiting the proliferation of technology to third parties like Iran. We are getting very few concessions on human rights conditions, particularly in the nation of Tibet. 
So as we make our agenda, as we make the plans for the President's trip to China, what are we getting? Out of the negotiations that have been going on, what kind of concessions do we find from the Chinese Government? There have been four major high-profile prisoners who have been released. There are thousands that remain incarcerated, thousands who remain languishing in Chinese laogai camps, yet we are expected to say there is progress in human rights because four high-profile individuals have been released. 
So, Mr. President, with your administration currently under investigation by your own Justice Department relating to this `missiles for money' transfer, it is inconceivable to me how you can go forward with your planned June 24th trip to China. The cloud now brewing over your administration's relationship with the leadership of the People's Republic of China makes suspect any agreements that may be reached or any statements that may be made during this summit. 
Mr. President, until this cloud of criminal and ethical investigations has blown over and been resolved, I urge you to delay your planned trip in June, and to postpone it. It is imperative that this country present a unified foreign policy. It is imperative that we be united in our international relationships, and particularly our relationship with this, the most populous nation on the globe. 
But in order to have that kind of unity, one that is free of partisanship, one that is untainted by allegations of illegal dealing, it is imperative that this planned trip in June be postponed. It is hard for me to imagine with such a cloud over our relationship with China, with such allegations of an organized, planned, if you will, conspiracy by the Chinese Government to influence the outcome of American elections, how any good could come from this trip to China at this stage. The atmosphere surrounding this summit has now been polluted. 
Mr. President, here again is what we know. We know that the CIA intercepted a call which hinted at a plan by China to influence our elections. And may I say, my colleague, Senator Thompson, should feel vindicated. And those who ridiculed his allegation in this regard should apologize to him personally, I believe. The American people owe him a debt of gratitude for his untiring efforts to reveal this nefarious plan. 
We know that the CIA intercepted that call. We know that Johnny Chung has testified that the PLA, through one of their top leaders, General Liu, provided $80,000 to the DNC and $20,000 to other Democratic causes. 
We know that at the same time as these moneys were being given to the DNC, the same time those contributions were being made, Loral and Hughes provided key missile technology to China and the PLA--under a waiver granted by the Clinton administration. 
We know that the State Department has said that this technology transfer `harmed our national security.' 
We know this, that an executive at Motorola also claims they are assisting China's missile program under a waiver from the Clinton administration. 
We further know that the Clinton administration shifted the key decisionmaking authority on satellite and missile technology from the State Department to the Commerce Department, which was a much more China-friendly agency or Department. 
We know this, that China transferred key military nuclear technology to Pakistan and to other rogue states like Iran, all without any action or denunciation by this administration. 
We know that all but five of China's long-range nuclear missiles are pointed at the United States. 
We know that the PLA continues to profit from selling consumer goods in the United States. And we know that the PLA continues to profit from slave labor. 
We know that human rights continue to be abused in China and that this administration has soft-pedaled very serious human rights concerns. 
This is an ugly list, detailing a tangled relationship that now appears to have forever damaged our national security, a relationship that now may have escalated the risk of nuclear war on the Asian continent and that will forever make it more difficult to keep the nuclear genie in a secure bottle. 
This relationship must be investigated. I believe appropriate Senate committees will be doing that investigation. We know that the Justice Department is continuing this investigation, but all questions relating to how this relationship progressed must be answered, and the President should delay and postpone his planned trip to China until those answers are forthcoming. The American people deserve to have those answers. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today's debate is about the security of the United States. The underlying question in the debate today on the Defense Department authorization bill concerns the safety and security of the citizens of the United States, and that is why I am offering an amendment that will give the President increased powers to confront America's greatest threat, or certainly America's greatest external threat, and that is the People's Liberation Army of the People's Republic of China. 
My amendment mirrors exactly the language that passed overwhelmingly on the floor of the House of Representatives last November. This language, in bill form, in the House passed by a vote of 405 to 10. 
The amendment would do two things: First, it would require the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Director of the Central Intelligence and the Director of the FBI, to maintain a current list of Chinese military firms operating directly or indirectly in the United States. This list, consisting strictly of PLA-owned companies, would be updated regularly in the Federal Register. 
Secondly, the amendment would give the President enhanced authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to take action against Chinese military-owned firms if circumstances warrant, including the President would have the authority to freeze assets or otherwise regulate these firms' activities. Thus, if a PLA-owned firm is found to be shipping missile-guidance components to a rogue state like Iran, the President would have the authority to take immediate action against a United States subsidiary of that firm which might, for example, be selling sporting goods in the United States. 
I should note that this amendment would not require the President to take any action whatsoever. It would simply enhance his ability to do so should he believe that the circumstances warrant that action. 
Let me explain the reasoning behind this amendment and why it is so critical, I believe, that the Senate adopt this amendment.  
Mr. President, last week I came to this floor to discuss the growing threat that the People's Republic of China poses to the citizens of the United States. I discussed the recent CIA report covered in the Washington Times on May 4, 1998, under the headline, `China Targets Nukes At U.S.' This article and this CIA report noted that 13 of China's 18 long-range strategic missiles, with ranges exceeding 8,000 miles, have single nuclear warheads aimed at the United States of America. 
These missiles, which are under the control of the PLA, with PLA officers manning their nuclear buttons, are in addition to China's 25 CSS-3 missiles, with ranges of more than 3,400 miles; its 18 CSS-4 missiles, with ranges exceeding 8,000 miles; and its planned DF-31, with a range exceeding 7,000 miles. 
Until last year, China lacked the military intelligence necessary to manufacturer boosters that could reliably strike at such long distances. 
Unfortunately, the Pentagon has reported that two U.S. companies--Loral Space and Communications and Hughes Electronics--illegally gave China space expertise during cooperation on a commercial satellite launch which could be used to develop an accurate launch and guidance system for ICBMs. This issue is still under investigation. But while it was still under investigation, in February, Loral launched another satellite on a Chinese rocket and provided the Chinese with the same expertise that is at issue in the criminal case. 
The chairman of the House Science Subcommittee on Space and Technology has received word from an unnamed official at Motorola that they, too, have been involved in `upgrading' China's missile capability. Interestingly, this executive claims that the work is being done under a waiver from this administration, thus circumventing all bans and restrictions on such technology transfers. 
The People's Liberation Army is engaged in a massive military buildup which has involved a doubling since 1992 of announced official figures for military spending by the PRC. We do not know how much may be spent, how much investment there may be in their military establishment that is not released for official consumption, but the official public figures indicate a doubling of that expenditure since 1992. 
The PLA is working to coproduce the SU-27 fighter with Russia and is in the process of purchasing several substantial weapons systems from Russia, including the 633 model of the Kilo-class submarine and the SS-N-22 Sunburn missile system specifically designed to incapacitate U.S. aircraft carriers and Aegis cruisers. 
So the question arises, Mr. President, how does the People's Liberation Army fund the ongoing arms race? By selling its technology to rogue states is one means by which they do it, selling arms, or at least attempting to sell arms, to U.S. gangs in our inner cities and selling CDs, socks, consumer electronics, and scores of other commercial items to U.S. consumers. 
For example, the People's Liberation Army has contributed to the proliferation of technologies relevant to the refinement of weapons-grade nuclear material, including transferring ring magnets to Pakistan. Additionally, the PLA and its associated defense companies have provided ballistic missile components, cruise missiles, chemical weapons ingredients, to Iran, a country that the executive branch has repeatedly reported to this Congress is the greatest sponsor of terrorism in the world today. 
I point to this chart. The source is the Office of Naval Intelligence, March of 1997. They reported:  
Discoveries after the Gulf War clearly indicate that Iraq maintained an aggressive (W)eapons of (M)ass (D)estruction procurement program. 
And then they point out: 
A similar situation exists today in Iran with a steady flow of materials and technologies from China to Iran. This exchange is one of the most active weapons of mass destruction programs in the Third World, and is taking place in a region of 
great strategic interest to the United States. 
So we have, I think, very clear, overwhelming evidence that China continues to export technology, nuclear technology as well, and in so doing places at risk the national security of the United States. 
They also are funding the arms buildup in China, not only by selling weapons to rogue states like Iraq and Iran, but also there is evidence that they are trying to actually sell weapons produced in the People's Republic of China to gangs in the United States. 
In May 1996, the U.S. authorities caught the People's Liberation Army enterprise entitled Poly Technologies--a PLA-owned and operated enterprise--they were caught by U.S. authorities, and the civilian defense industrial company, Norinco, that is also involved, the U.S. authorities caught these two companies attempting to smuggle 2,000 AK-47s into Oakland, CA, and offering to sell urban gangs shoulder-held missile launchers capable of taking out a 747. 
Communist authorities, upon capture of these individuals, punished only four of them--four low-level arms merchants--and they did so, sentencing them May 17, 1997, to brief prison terms. 
I would suggest and I suspect that the prison terms given to these merchants of arms to the young people of this country were far less than the prison terms that have been exacted upon those prisoners of conscience, those who dared to speak up against the oppressive regime that controls the largest nation in the world. Eight years was given to Wang Dan for his support of the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square almost 9 years ago in addition to the 12 years that he was recently serving for supporting democracy in China. 
It is estimated that the PLA earns $2 billion to $4 billion a year in earnings through the many enterprises that it operates that deal in nonmilitary commodities and that these enterprises profit handsomely from their activities in the United States. A report released earlier this year indicated that vast quantities of goods, as varied as toys, skis, garlic, iron weight sets, men's pants, car radiators, glassware, swimming suits, and many more such commercial domestic items are being sold to U.S. consumers by PLA-owned firms. 
This chart indicates--and I will quote from this chart regarding the PLA-affiliated companies and their operation in the United States. This comes from the Institutional Investor, July of 1996: `And we find that military-affiliated companies can be found in virtually every part of the Chinese economy with the most rapid expansion occurring in the lucrative service industries. Though the PLA enterprises are scattered throughout the economy, they have carved out niches in the eight areas to the right'--including transportation, vehicle production, pharmaceuticals, hotels, real estate development, garment production, mining and communications. 
Some of these products are being exported--which becomes a rich source of revenue for the People's Liberation Army. Even those products and those services that are sold domestically to the Chinese people become an unaccounted for subsidy, if you will, for the arms race, in the development of the PLA military strength and might. So I believe this should be of great concern to us as we continue to see the PLA fund the arms race. 
I point out that the Chinese defense industrial trade organizations have a broad, broad interrelationship with the industries in China. This chart shows the web of PLA-owned enterprises that operate in the United States and around the world. 
All of the companies on the left, in the peach color, are companies that have been documented by our Defense Intelligence Agency as being directly owned by the People's Liberation Army. The ones to the other side, in the yellow, are their defense industrial base. Some of them have indirect connections also, but they are not directly owned by the People's Liberation Army. 
This next chart I believe shows the chain of command for companies like China Poly Group, China Carrie Corp., and other well-known Chinese companies and their interrelationship with the government and the PLA and the Communist Party. In fact, the Communist Party Central Military Commission is right at the top of the chain of command--going down to these various companies, including the China Poly Group, and the 999 Enterprise Group, and so forth. 
I think the American people would be shocked to see the companies listed on this chart. This, I might add, is a very incomplete list, which is why I emphasize again the need for this amendment which would require a listing to be published of all PLA-owned enterprises that are buying and selling and doing business in the United States. 
It is well documented that the PLA violates international intellectual property rights by running factories which pirate videos, compact discs, and computer software that are products of the United States. This is the main reason the People's Republic of China failed to meet the standards of the 1995 memorandum of understanding with the United States on the protection of intellectual property rights. During my trip to China in January, I saw firsthand the evidence of the pirating of videos and CDs and the selling of those pirated products on the market, on the streets of Shanghai and Beijing. 
In violation of a February 1997 agreement with the United States, the People's Liberation Army continued to operate enterprises which engaged in the transshipment of textile products through third countries, thus thwarting tariffs and restrictions on illegally produced items from China. 
With all but five of China's long-range nuclear missiles pointed at the citizens of the United States, it is obvious that the increasingly aggressive People's Liberation Army views the United States as its most serious adversary. My colleagues have said they would like China as an ally. We would all like to have China as an ally. But let us not fool ourselves. When our Central Intelligence Agency tells us their missiles--13 of 18 of their long-range nuclear missiles--are pointed at the citizens of the United States, it is clear they view us as an adversary. It is a sad paradox that U.S. consumers, American consumers, purchasers of products in retail stores across this country, are the unwitting supporters of and funders of the military that has their hand on the nuclear button that threatens cities in the United States. 
Now, as we talk about the response of this amendment, of letting the American people know what companies are owned directly and indirectly by the military of the Chinese communist government, it seems to me to be a very basic freedom-of-information kind of issue, the right-to-know kind of issue. 
We talk about the response of the President, having the enhanced authority to deal with those PLA-owned companies that might be subsidizing the military buildup in China. It is important for us to remember the ongoing human rights violations that are occurring in China. Not only are they increasing their threat internationally, but within their own borders they continue to oppress their own people. This is not some human rights watchdog group that I am going to cite. It is our own State Department which each year issues a report from various countries around the world on human rights conditions. The latest State Department report on human rights in China shows that China is still one of the major offenders of internationally recognized human rights standards. This report notes that China is continuing to engage in `torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced abortion and sterilization, crackdowns on independent Catholic and Protestant bishops and believers, brutal oppression of ethnic minorities and religions in Tibet and Xinjiang, and absolute intolerance of free political speech or free press.' 
To visit Shanghai, to visit Beijing, some of the largest cities in the world, the most populous cities in the world, and to realize there is not one free newspaper in those cities--in northwest Arkansas, in a two-county area, population of 200,000, we have half a dozen competing newspapers. These are free voices--free to criticize me, free to criticize this U.S. Senate, free to criticize our President--and in the largest cities in the world in China, not one voice of freedom, not one voice to reflect the values of democracy. 
So let us in this China debate, and as we look at amendments 
to the Department of Defense authorization bill, remember the ongoing human rights abuses that are taking place. Furthermore, that the current policy that we have pursued has so dismally failed. 
According to a recent report in the Washington Post entitled `U.S.-China Talks Make Little Progress on Summit Agenda,' the United States is getting very few concessions from China relating to the inspection of the technology we share with them, concessions on limiting proliferation of technology to third parties like Iran, or concessions on human rights conditions, particularly in Tibet. 
So our President is preparing to go to China next month, negotiations going on. We would hope they would be positive in light of our so-called policy of constructive engagement, yet we find our policy is one of give and give and give. We are not seeing corresponding concessions on the part of the Chinese Government. In fact, we are continuing to see these horrible human rights abuses taking place. 
We have provided key technology that puts our own country at risk. We have set up a hotline that reaches from the White House to China. We have begun assisting China on its efforts to gain membership in the World Trade Organization. We dropped, to the consternation of many Members of this body, we dropped our annual push for a resolution condemning China's human rights record at the United Nations, something this country has done year after year as part of our foreign policy. We dropped that resolution so as not to offend the Chinese Government. We continue to allow PLA-owned companies to operate unregulated in the United States, and we continue to provide China most-favored-nation status. In return, we have witnessed the release of four, in return for all of these concessions that we have granted, we have seen the Chinese Communist government release four prominent prisoners out of the thousands upon thousands of political and religious dissidents being held today in Chinese prisons. 
So I say to my colleagues, the American people have a right to know they are funding the People's Liberation Army. I believe the American consumers ought to know whether the products they are buying--including things like toys, sweaters and porcelain that they might purchase for the upcoming holidays--are supporting the People's Liberation Army and the kind of activities that I have identified today. The American people have a right to know. It may not be possible for American consumers to go into a Wal-Mart or Kmart or Target store and to identify all of the Chinese-produced products and to decide voluntarily they are not going to support that. But at least they ought to know which of those companies are controlled, directly or indirectly, by a military establishment in China that has targeted American cities with its missiles. 
This amendment will help to do just that. It is needed both to shed light on the PLA's activities in the United States and to ensure that the President has the latitude and has the authority he needs to take appropriate actions when the evidence of wrongdoing arises. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. 
Again, this amendment merely requires the Secretary of Defense to document and list PLA-owned companies operating in the United States and provides the President with the power, authority, and discretion to take action against these companies, should circumstances so warrant. It does not require the President to do anything. I believe it is a commonsense amendment that, once again, passed by an overwhelming margin in the U.S. House of Representatives. I ask for my colleagues' support. 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

I remind my distinguished colleague that this is the exact language that passed by a 405-10 vote in the House, and I would regard that as pretty bipartisan and noncontroversial. That language passed out of the House last November and has been referred to the appropriate committees, where it has--if I might use the word--`languished' for several months without any action. So it is for that reason I think it is imperative that the Senate have an opportunity to express its will on something the House expressed its opinion on months ago.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I think there were 10 bills that passed out of the House regarding China policy as a block, separate bills, but that was last November. Two of those have passed, in various forms, in the Senate. Six of those bills were referred to the Foreign Relations Committee. The other two--the two I am now offering--one was referred to Banking and the other to Finance. I have had ongoing discussions with Senator Helms of the Foreign Relations Committee. It is my understanding that they will address these bills this coming week. Therefore, I defer taking any action upon those because of the committee's anticipation of looking at these next week. 
The ones in Banking and Finance I thought were important to move ahead on. This was the most appropriate vehicle before us. I am not aware that there were any plans for hearings. Since so much time had elapsed since they were referred to the Senate, it would seem to be the appropriate time to move them.

<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, this amendment is simple and, again, it was noncontroversial when it was voted on in the House of Representatives. In fact, the language in this amendment passed the House with almost unanimous support. Having served in the House 4 years, I know this happens rarely. It was a 419-to-2 vote. So, it had overwhelming bipartisan support. 
This amendment will simply do two things: First, it will express the sense of the Congress that the President should replace any memorandums of understanding on prison labor that lack effective monitoring procedures like the one negotiated with the People's Republic of China and replace the agreement with a stricter monitoring system. 
Second, the bill authorizes $2 million in additional funds for the U.S. Customs Service to monitor the importation of slave-labor-produced goods. As everyone in this body knows, the importation of goods made by convicts has been banned for more than a half a century. This law underscores Americans' firm conviction that such products produced by coerced and forced labor should not be sold in this country. I believe Americans are repulsed by the very thought of benefiting from cheap prices on products produced by the sweat and blood of foreign prisoners. 
Despite this ban, products made in Communist China's vast archipelago of slave labor camps, known as the laogai, continue to flow into this country unabated. This system of laogai, a word meaning reform through labor, was designed for the dual purposes of political control and forced economic development. Interestingly, this system is modeled on Stalin's Soviet Gulag, which we all remember was exposed most graphically by Alexander Solzhenitsyn. 
This system of forced labor, slave labor, has been an integral part of Chinese totalitarianism since the inception of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Harry Wu, a survivor of the laogai, and a friend of mine, has estimated that some 50 million Chinese men and women have passed through these camps, of whom 15 million have perished. Today, anywhere from 6 to 8 million people are captive in the 1,100 camps of laogai, held and forced to work under grossly inhumane conditions. 
According to official statistics, the laogai operate 140 export enterprises selling products to over 70 nations abroad, including the United States. These enterprises are responsible for producing key commodities, including uranium, graphite, rubber, cotton, asbestos, and one-third of Chinese tea is produced in these slave labor camps, as well as a huge array of consumer goods, including toys, artificial flowers and, ironically, Christmas lights and rosaries. 
When I went to China in January, I asked to visit a laogai prison. In fact, I asked every day. I asked repeatedly, and repeatedly, but my requests to visit a laogai prison were denied. Fortunately, one of my colleagues in the House on an earlier trip, Representative Frank Wolf, was able to visit Beijing Prison No. 1. This is the exterior of that prison camp that Congressman Wolf visited, a prison camp that includes a slave labor industry. 
This second photo shows us the picture of the Beijing hosiery factory. This is located inside of that prison camp. 
The third photo actually shows the assembly line where these products are made. 
In this prison, Mr. Wolf found slave laborers producing socks on this assembly line. I have some of the very socks produced on that assembly line which Mr. Wolf brought back. You can see the socks. This particular pair was determined to be for export. This is not just a matter of laogai slave labor prisons, which would be horrific enough, that would be bad enough, but these particular products were made for export to other countries. 
When I was in China, I saw many things. One thing I did not 
see was any golf courses, but the logo on these socks is a person swinging a golf club, obviously not intended for sale within China but for sale on the foreign market. 
Although the United States entered into binding agreements with China in 1992 and 1994 to bar trade in prison labor products and to allow inspection of its forced-labor camps, the Chinese Government has frustrated their implementation, both by using dual names to disguise camp products and by denying access to those slave labor camps. 
In 1996, the Chinese Government granted access to just one prison labor camp. Out of the whole laogai system, access in 1996 was granted to only one that had been requested by the U.S. Customs Service. 
Mr. President, the following two charts show examples of laogai prison camps that have never been inspected, though the request has been made to visit. These photos were taken, obviously, outside the camp. This is laogai slave labor camp No. 5 and Zhejiang laogai slave labor camp. Both of these labor camps--we have a second picture as well--show individuals going into the camp. These pictures were obtained by the Laogai Research Foundation. 
Mr. President, the two most recent State Department human rights reports on China state that `Repeated delays in arranging prison labor site visits called into question the government's intention regarding the implementation of the two agreements.' 
So we have two agreements with China which were to provide for inspections of these camps in which these kinds of products are made to compete with American workers. According to our State Department, we have found, instead of cooperation, obstructionism and delays in arranging for visits to those labor camps. 
Obviously, I think this indicates that the Chinese Government is not intent on cooperating with us on trying to ensure that the products produced are not being sold domestically or to the foreign market and that humane conditions prevail in these camps.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today an important piece of legislation which would restore fairness to small businesses and their employees in the nation's labor laws, and ensure freedom of choice in the marketplace. `The Fairness for Small Business and Employees Act of 1998' will achieve these goals, and improve fairness in the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) process. 
Small businesses are facing a serious and devastating problem. They are the targets of unethical attempts to manipulate the law in order to injure or destroy the competition. We cannot allow any group with an ulterior and destructive motive to use coercive governmental power just to harass small businesses and their workers. 
Frivolus charges cost companies significant time, money, and resources to defend themselves against complaints that have no merit. Small businesses, in particular, need these resources to secure more work opportunities, invest in better equipment, and create more jobs. 
The bill I am introducing today consists of three separate small business bills, which I have previously introduced in the Senate: `The Truth in Employment Act,' `The Fair Hearing Act,' and `The Fair Access to Indemnity and Reimbursement Act (FAIR) Act.' 
The first provision, `The Truth in Employment Act,' remedies the unscrupulous practice of `salting' by amending the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to make clear that an employer is not required to hire any person who seeks a job in order to promote interests unrelated to those of the employer. I would point out that the language in no way infringes upon any rights or protections otherwise accorded employees under the NLRA, including the right to organize. This provision would merely alleviate the legal pressures imposed upon employers to hire individuals whose overriding purpose for seeking the job is to disrupt the employer's workplace, or otherwise inflict economic harm designed to put the employer out of business. 
The second section, `The Fair Hearing Act,' would create a statutory right to a hearing for the employer when there is a dispute regarding the proper bargaining unit of a company with multiple locations. While the NLRB proposal has been `tabled' for now, there is still nothing in the law to assure fairness for employees. 
The last provision, `The Fair Access to Indemnity and Reimbursement Act (FAIR) Act,' would amend the NLRA to provide that a small business or labor organization which prevails in an action against the NLRB will automatically be allowed to recoup the attorneys' fees and expenses it spends defending itself. Small employers often cannot afford the qualified legal representation necessary to defend themselves against NLRB charges. 
Mr. President, it is time to stop the devastating impact of unfair labor law enforcement on small businesses and their employees. Small businesses are truly the backbone of our nation's economy. We must curtail the anti-competitive attacks, and instead help these companies devote time, money, and resources toward productivity, growth, and providing new jobs. 
I would urge my fellow Senators to join me in cosponsoring this legislation, and work to pass `The Fairness for Small Business and Employees Act of 1998.' The survival of America's small businesses demand that we act.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, today, as you may be aware, is Asthma Awareness Day. I rise to discuss the issue of CFC-propelled asthma inhalers. 
CFC-propelled inhalers are a necessary tool for proper management of asthma and other respiratory illnesses. Over 30 million Americans depend on these inhalers in order to function normally in their daily lives. In many cases, they are literally the difference between life and death. 
I recently joined my colleague, Senator DeWine, in introducing S. 2026, the Asthma Inhaler Protection Act. This bill is a revised version of legislation that I introduced last year in response to the Food and Drug Administration's announcement of its plans to issue a rule that will phase out the production of CFC-propelled inhalers. 
The FDA's announcement to phase-out metered-dose inhalers was prompted by the Montreal Protocol agreement to eliminate ozone depleting chemicals, including CFCs. In the U.S., the manufacture of CFCs was discontinued in January of 1996. CFCs may still be used, however, as long as their use qualifies as an `essential use.' Currently, inhalers are considered as `essential use' and are exempt from the CFC ban. 
As the United States contemplates total elimination of CFCs and removal of the essential use designation for inhalers, we face several issues. 
First of all, how fast should we phase out CFC inhalers and will patients' health be jeopardized? It is my understanding that the amount of CFCs released by metered-dose inhalers accounts for less than 1.5 percent of the total amount emitted into the atmosphere. Is the environmental benefit of phasing out inhalers without taking into account the full needs of patients worth placing lives in danger? 
As a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, I support the goal of ridding our environment of ozone depleting chemicals. 
However, from a patient perspective, any transition to CFC-free alternatives that does not take into account the needs of all patients will do more harm than good. 
Under the FDA's initial proposal, a whole class of inhalers could be removed from the market if only three alternatives exist. The method by which the FDA has grouped inhaler medications into classes assumes that they are medically and therapeutically equivalent. I suggest to my colleagues this is FALSE. 
Inhalers vary in terms of formulation, dosage strength, delivery of medication, and their effectiveness for patients. Patients frequently test several inhalers under physician supervision before they find the inhaler that works best for them. To deny patients their inhaler without a suitable range of alternatives could potentially put their lives at risk. 
Another concern that cannot be overlooked is how the removal of existing products and their generic counterparts will influence the marketplace. A decrease in competition has obvious consequences in terms of cost and the availability of drugs on the shelf. 
Finally, the FDA should take into account other countries' strategies for phasing out CFCs in inhalers in order to ensure that the U.S. takes the best and most responsible approach. I know that Canada, for example, has rejected the class approach taken by the FDA and proposed a policy that will require a proper range of alternatives to exist for each medication type. It also provides for a transition period so patients can ease off of their current medication and make sure that there is a new product that accommodates their needs. 
The Asthma Inhaler Protection Act addresses all of these issues by including three requirements. First, before any further rulemaking, the FDA must conduct assessments and report to Congress on the health and environmental risks associated with its initial proposal. It must also consider whether any measures adopted by the meeting of the Montreal Protocol this November will facilitate the United States' transition away from CFC inhalers. 
Second, the FDA is required to develop criteria by which `essential use' allowances for CFC-propelled inhalers will be removed. These criteria shall require that a range of alternatives are available for each medication type, and that they are comparable in terms of dosage strength, delivery systems and safety and efficacy. Furthermore, the alternatives must be available in sufficient numbers to meet consumer demand. 
Finally, the Asthma Inhaler Protection Act includes steps to ensure that manufacturers will begin to transition away from inhalers that employ CFCs. Under the bill, no new applications for products containing CFCs will be considered by the FDA after 1998 unless they represent a significant advance in technology. Any new approvals, however, will be subject to the same criteria as I described earlier. 
Madam President, the transition to non-CFC propelled inhalers in the United States must be well-planned and take into account both patient and environmental concerns. It is clear that the FDA needs to rethink its approach. We knew this last year after the FDA published its proposal and was flooded by more than 10,000 comments from concerned patients, providers, state medical boards, and advocacy groups. These concerns were again raised last month during a Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee hearing which Chairman Jeffords held at my request. 
The Asthma Inhaler Protection Act will ensure that the FDA balances patients needs with environmental concerns, and above all, does not jeopardize the lives of millions of Americans who depend on CFC metered-dose inhalers. 
It is simply a matter of ensuring that the 30 million Americans currently dependent upon these inhalers--and all of us have seen them; these little canisters that asthmatics carry with them every day everywhere they go--we simply must ensure that as the FDA moves forward that they will do so in a way that ensures that patients all across this country are not allowed to go without medical care that they so desperately need; and that the policy of the FDA will be such that these patients will know that they are not going to have less choice than they have now; that the particular peculiar medical needs that asthmatics and others of respiratory diseases have will be met; that they will be assured that the needs that they have can be addressed; and, that the FDA will take those concerns into account as they move forward. 
I believe the FDA will be responsive. This legislation, though, is there, and I am looking forward to working with Senator DeWine, Congressman Patrick Kennedy and Congressman Mark Foley on the House side to ensure that as the FDA moves forward with its rulemaking that it will do so in a way that is going to ensure that 30 million Americans are cared for and are not left in the lurch worried that their very lives might be in danger. 
I hope all of us on this day, the first Asthma Awareness Day, will do our part to educate the American people about the serious health impact, particularly upon our children, that asthma is having, and the dramatic increase that we have seen in asthma in this country, and that the FDA in their, I think, well-motivated goal of removing these chemicals from our environment will do so in a way that the health and safety of the American people is protected. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, the headlines in last week's newspapers ought to bring pause to this body and to all of us as Americans. The Washington Times, on Friday, had the headline `China Targets Nukes at U.S.' The inside part of that article, on a graphic, it says `China's Long-Range Missiles,' quoting a CIA report last May that `13 of China's 18 CSS-4 missiles are now targeted at cities in the United States of America.' 
This report was followed by a report in the Washington Times today, headlined `U.S. Firms Make China More Dangerous: Technology Aid Helps Missiles Reach America.' I will say that again. `Technology Aid Helps Missiles Reach America.' This was also reported in the New York Times, another major newspaper in the United States. These stories are based on a new CIA report released last week that noted that 13 of China's 18 long-range strategic missiles have single nuclear warheads aimed at U.S. cities. These missiles, with a range of over 8,000 miles, prove convincingly that China views the United States as its most serious adversary. This is further proof, I believe, that the current administration's policy of so-called constructive engagement has failed, and failed terribly, as China continues to go this route, as China continues to take provocative actions and actions that seriously endanger the security of the United States. It is important to note that these missiles are in addition to China's 25 CSS-3 missiles, with ranges of more than 3,400 miles, and its 18 CSS-4 missiles, with ranges exceeding 8,000 miles, and its planned DF-31, with a range exceeding 7,000 miles. 
Until last year, China lacked even the intelligence, and certainly they lacked the technology necessary to manufacture boosters that could reliably strike at such long distances. In fact, it is reported that in a launch test of the boosters, their technology failed to launch the boosters three out of five times. That is a 60-percent failure rate. Likewise, they were years from developing the space technology necessary to launch multiple, independently targetable reentry vehicles, otherwise known as MIRVs, multiple warhead missiles. Now they are only years away, if not months, from having such technology. 
Some time ago, I participated in a firing-line debate on the campus of the University of Mississippi. During that debate, when the issue of national security was raised, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger reassured the audience of thousands, and the nationwide television audience of millions, that we need not be concerned about China's capability to launch missiles that might place American cities at risk. He said, in fact, it would be a couple of decades before China was anywhere 
near having the technology that could place the United States and American citizens at risk. Well, now we find that because of our own aid, and because of our own technology transfers to China, already we are seeing these missiles targeting American cities, and that this advanced technology is very much now at their disposal. 
How did China get this technology? Two U.S. companies--the Loral Space and Communications Company and the Hughes Electronic Company--are under investigation by the State Department following a classified Pentagon report that concluded that the two companies illegally gave China space expertise during cooperation on a Chinese commercial satellite launch. This report concluded that `the United States national security has been harmed.' 
Here are the details: In 1996, during the course of an investigation of a Chinese rocket carrying a $200 million Loral satellite, scientists allegedly shared with their Chinese counterparts a report explaining the cause of the accident, which turned out to be an electrical flaw in the flight control system. This system is similar to those used on ICBM launch-guidance systems. 
In February, with the investigation of this incident underway, President Clinton permitted Loral to launch another satellite on a Chinese rocket and to provide the Chinese with the same expertise that is at issue in the criminal case, officials have said. A senior official said the administration recognized the sensitivity of the decision but approved the launch because the investigation had reached no conclusions, and Loral had properly handled accident launches. The administration, he said, still could take administrative action against the companies if they were found to have violated export laws in their earlier dealings with the Chinese. 
Another company--Motorola--is also involved in upgrading China's missile system. The chairman of the House Science Subcommittee on Space and Technology received word from an unnamed official from Motorola that they, too, have been involved in upgrading China's missile capability. Interestingly, this executive claims the work is being done under a waiver--a waiver granted from the Clinton administration--thus, circumventing all of the bans and restrictions on such technology transfers. This technology was supposed to be controlled, restricted. Madam President, trade in missile and space technology to China was supposed to be severely restricted under the sanctions related to the crackdown of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Unfortunately, this administration has implemented a give-give strategy of appeasement, which has weakened or eliminated most of these restrictions. 
Politics must not supersede national security concerns. Why did this administration make such an incredible and risky decision? Loral has numerous business deals with China. Loral has close ties to the White House. Its chairman and chief executive officer, Bernard Schwartz, was the largest individual contributor to the Democratic National Committee last year. Motorola's involvement and ties with this administration are just now being investigated. This raises serious questions and puts a dark cloud over these dealings, particularly in light of the CIA report indicating China is now targeting American cities. 
In addition to legally getting this technology through these waivers from the current administration, China has twice violated its agreement to follow the principles of the missile technology and control regime. Yet, under this administration's policy of appeasement, the administration is asking China to sign on to the missile technology regime. This is like stacking new promises on top of broken promises and then calling it progress. It is important to note that China's inclusion in the missile regime would allow even greater technology transfers to be made, thus, putting more Americans at even greater risk. 
Madam President, most importantly, China continues to repress and oppress its own people, in violation of international law. The latest State Department Report on Human Rights in China shows that China is still a major, if not the major, offender of internationally recognized human rights in the world today. 
This report from our own State Department notes that China continues to engage in `torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced abortion and sterilization, crackdowns on independent Catholic and Protestant bishops and believers, brutal oppression of ethnic minorities and religions in Tibet and Xinjiang and, of course, absolute intolerance of free political speech or free press'--from our State Department report. 
These are not new charges. The tragedy is not that we are hearing these charges repeated; the tragedy is that we continue the same policy that has allowed these kinds of repression and repressive practices to exist. We continue along the same line as if everything is fine. Human rights abuses, religious persecution, forced abortion, and slavery are all raised at the staff level, with only token concern expressed by senior officials in this administration. 
In addition to this report from the State Department, there are well documented abuses. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York has indicted two Chinese immigrants for the sale and marketing of human body parts. I raised this allegation at a speech that I gave at the Fulbright Institute on the campus of the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, with many visitors there from outside the State of Arkansas, and their disbelief and skepticism was expressed to me that this in fact was factual. 
Well, it is factual. It is beyond dispute that two indictments have been brought down regarding the sale of human body parts and harvesting of these body parts from Chinese prisoners with the full cooperation of the Chinese Government, and in some instances U.S. businesses. In this case, U.S. industry is alleged to have provided the Chinese Government with a dialysis machine to assist the harvesting of organs in their prison hospitals. 
On the policy of appeasement--the administration calls it `constructive engagement'--I think indisputably today a policy of appeasement to the Chinese Government is obviously failing. According to a report in the Washington Post on Friday titled `U.S.-China Talks Make Little Progress on Summit Agenda,' the United States, we find, is getting few concessions from China relating to the inspection of technology that we share with them; we are getting few concessions on limiting proliferation of technology to third-party states like Iran; and we are getting few concessions on the most important issue of all--that of human rights conditions, particularly in Tibet. 
As the President prepares to travel to China, as he prepares to continue this policy of so-called `constructive engagement,' we find that even as we seek concessions in line with international norms, that we meet a stone wall. Our only token concessions are the release of high-profile prisoners. Despite this very obvious failure, we continue to give, and give under the guise of `constructive engagement.' 
We have provided key technology that puts our own country at risk. We have set up a hot line that reaches from the White House to China. We have begun assisting China in its efforts to gain membership into the World Trade Organization, even as our balance of trade with China reaches new levels, new highs. Yet we try to orchestrate their efforts to get into the WTO. We dropped our annual push for a resolution condemning China's human rights record at the United Nations. This is something we have done year in and year out. We called upon the United 
Nations to condemn the abuses that are ongoing in China. This administration has dropped even that kind of symbolic gesture that has been a part of our foreign policy. 
We failed to do that in spite of the adoption of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution asking this administration to do that. And we continue to provide China most-favored-nation status. In return for this, we have witnessed the release of three--we have witnessed the release of three--high-profile prisoners of conscience from China's prisons, three out of the thousands upon thousands of political and religious dissidents currently held in Chinese prisons. 
I would suggest to my colleagues in the Senate that we need to immediately respond in two ways. First of all, the Senate should immediately pass the 8 House-passed bills on China, bills that the House of Representatives adopted on huge bipartisan margins, by huge margins last year, usually from 350 votes to 400-plus votes on these various bills, short of denying most-favored-nation status but at least taking targeted measures to tell this repressive government in Beijing that the United States is serious when it announces its concerns about the abuses that are ongoing in China. Eight bills--ten bills passed the House. Two of them we have adopted in the Senate, but eight continue to languish without action. 
I asked our majority leader. I talked with him. He has given positive indications that we will bring these eight House bills to the floor for a vote in the U.S. Senate prior to the President's trip to Beijing in June. 
These bills include H.R. 2195 regarding slave labor, which passed the House by a vote of 419 to 2. H.R. 2195 was designed to keep slave-labor products out of the United States, authorizing needed funding for genuine enforcement of the ban on slave-labor products, calling upon the President to strengthen international agreements to improve monitoring of slave-labor imports. If it passed by this overwhelming margin in the House, I suspect if we had an opportunity to vote on that in the Senate, it would pass by an equally large margin. It is something we need to do before the President travels to China. 
H.R. 967, the `Free the Clergy' bill, which passed the House on November 6 of last year by a 366 to 54 margin: H.R. 967 targets those Communist officials who engage in religious persecution, banning their travel to the United States by prohibiting the expenditure of any U.S. taxpayer dollars in support of their travel and subjecting it to a Presidential waiver allowing them to be denied their visas. I think that is a simple step, a very modest step, that we should, that we must, do to ensure that United States statements of concern about religious persecution in China have some validity--even the denial of visas, travel opportunities, for those officials in China who continue to practice and implement the policy of religious persecution. 
H.R. 2570 regarding forced abortions passed the House on November 6, 1997, with a 415-to-1 margin, yet the Senate these many months later has not yet had an opportunity to vote on this bill. This bill, H.R. 2570, targets those Communist officials involved in forced abortion sterilization, banning once again their travel to the United States. I think that, once again, is a very modest move. It is about the most modest move that we could possibly take regarding Communist government officials who are implementing a policy of forced abortion and sterilizations in China today and prohibiting them from traveling to the United 
States. 
H.R. 2358 on human rights monitors passed the House by a 416-to-5 vote. It would increase six-fold the number of U.S. diplomats at the Beijing Embassy assigned to monitor human rights. 
I visited China in January. I know firsthand how short-handed our State Department officials and diplomatic officials are and how limited they are in their ability to monitor the ongoing human rights abuses in China. If we are to have the knowledge, if we as a body are to have the information that we so desperately need, these human rights monitors are needed. In addition, the new law will add at least one human rights monitor to each U.S. consulate in Communist China. 
H.R. 2232 on Radio Free Asia passed the House by a 401-to-21 margin and would fund a 24-hour-a-day broadcast throughout Communist China in each of the major dialects spoken in China. This Radio Free Asia bill will allow the truth of freedom to penetrate Communist China. And, in fact, the truth will set them free. And, as we are allowed to give the story of freedom and the story of democracy, the democracy movement, which was so alive almost 9 years ago on Tiananmen Square, will be alive and evident again in China. It passed by an overwhelming margin. 
H.R. 2605 on World Bank loans passed the House by a 354-to-59 margin. This bill would direct U.S. representatives at the World Bank to vote against below-market subsidies for Communist China. This is far short of denying MFN. I have heard all of the arguments against denying MFN in China. Indeed, this is not a blunt instrument. This is a very sharp scalpel, a very small instrument that can be used, simply denying subsidized loans by the American taxpayer to the Government of Communist China, which continues to practice these horrendous abuses against their own people. 
H.R. 2647, the People's Liberation Army companies, corporations--companies and businesses and enterprises owned and operated by the People's Liberation Army, which passed the House by a vote of 405 to 10, would require the Defense Department, the Justice Department, the FBI, and the CIA to compile a list of known PLA commercial fronts operating in the United States and would authorize the President to monitor, to restrict, and to seize the assets of and ban such PLA companies within the United States. 
For my colleagues, I would say these are companies predominantly owned and operated by the military of Communist China. These companies should not be free to operate and to trade freely in the United States. So this would authorize our various agencies--the Defense Department, Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and so forth--to monitor, to provide a list and authorize the President to restrict and seize the assets of such companies. 
H.R. 2386, this legislation, passing by a vote of 301 to 116, provides that the United States shall help Taiwan to develop and deploy an effective theater missile defense system. It has been obvious by some of the actions and some of the statements of the Beijing regime that they had designs on free Taiwan. This would simply be a step in ensuring that Taiwan would be able to defend themselves against any overt military action by the mainland Chinese Communist government. 
The second step I believe that we should take as a body, the Senate should support the resolution that I introduced on releasing the remaining dissidents in China. Senate Resolution 212, which I introduced on April 22, last month, with six cosponsors, has been referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and expresses the sense of the Senate that at the upcoming United States-China summit the President should demand the release of all persons remaining imprisoned in China and Tibet for political or religious reasons. 
I hope that as our President journeys to China these most important issues--human rights, religious persecution, weapons proliferation--would not be relegated to staff level discussions but, in fact, the President himself would elevate them and would ensure that these issues become the primary focus of our relationship with China and that progress on these fronts is directly linked to the trade opportunities that China seeks. This resolution states that in the upcoming proposed summit between President Clinton and President Jiang of China, President Clinton should demand the immediate and unconditional release, consistent with established principles of human rights, of all persons remaining in China and Tibet for political or religious reasons. 
It says, secondly, the President should submit a report to Congress as soon as possible after the proposed summit in China concerning his progress in securing the release of persons imprisoned in China and Tibet. 
Third, it says one prisoner released into exile does not change the fundamental flaws within the Chinese judicial and penal system. 
Fourth, it states that the U.S. policy of granting concessions to the Chinese Government in exchange for the release of high-profile prisoners is an offense to the thousands of dissidents remaining in prison. 
I, as all Americans, rejoice and am thrilled at the release of any prisoner of conscience in China. Wang Dan's release, I am glad for that. Wei's release, I am glad for that. But I also know that the release of a handful of well-known dissidents is no substitute for change in the fundamental policy of the Chinaese Government, which continues to be one of repression and persecution of those who would raise their voice for freedom or raise their voice for their own conscience. 
And then the resolution states that the President should not offer to lift the sanctions imposed on China after the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square, and those measures should not be 
reversed until we see substantive and real changes in the policies of the Chinese Government. I am not anti-Chinese. I was thrilled while I was in China to meet scores of individuals in China who are going about their daily lives making a living. I was glad to see the progress in moving toward a market system. I was glad to see the churches that are, though regulated stringently by the government, filled to the brim every Sunday. I was glad to see the Buddhist temples, though, once again, strictly regulated by the government, seeking to operate and continuing to operate. But I was chagrined to see that the government's fundamental policy towards its own people has not changed, that their concept of freedom is not that which is embedded in the founding documents envisioned by our Founding Fathers and appreciated and admired and accepted by the international community all over this world. 
This is not a case of the United States seeking to impose its ideas of democracy upon another culture. It, rather, is seeking to have our country, as it always has, reflect in our foreign policy the underlying values of freedom that are not American but are human, that transcend every national boundary, that transcend every culture and society and are fundamental for basic respect of human dignity and human rights. 
It is that, I think, President Reagan had in mind when he spoke of this country as a shining city on a hill, a nation that could be admired and respected the world over because of a foreign policy, reflected in its attitude and in its policies toward our neighbors around the world, of fundamental respect for human rights. It was almost 9 years ago when the massacre at Tiananmen occurred--June 8 and June 9, almost 9 years ago. Those students, hundreds of them that were massacred, looked to the United States as its emblem, as its symbol of freedom in the world. It was Lady Liberty that they erected that stood there in Tiananmen Square day after day, week after week, testimony to the desire of Chinese people for greater freedom. Now it is our time to stand with them. It is time for our President as he journeys to China to take this stand forcefully and to elevate this as the primary reason, the primary purpose in his journey to that important nation in the world. And as he is willing to do that, this body will stand with him. I hope, once again, that the Senate will adopt the House-passed bills, that we will adopt the sense of the Senate, and in so doing we will arm the President with the forceful opinion of the American people that fundamental change needs to take place in the Chinese Communist government in its attitudes and its policies toward its own people. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mrs. HUTCHINSON. Title IX of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits sex-based discrimination by any school receiving federal funds. However, by explicit omission, Title IX does not apply to admissions at same-gender public schools. This is confirmed by Department of Education regulations that allow public, same-gender schools, as long as comparable courses and facilities are offered to both sexes. That word, `comparable,' is the precise word used by the Department in their own regulations. They do not say `equal'--they say `comparable.' My guess as to why they chose not to use the word equal is they came to the same conclusion as I did when drafting my amendment--that `equal' means `the same,' and that requiring two or more schools or two or more classrooms, (same-gender or coed), to be exactly the same would pose a nearly impossible administrative and legal burden for any school official to meet. It also simply misses the point that in some respects the educational needs of boys and girls are different, and that these differences cannot and should not be ignored. An all-girls or all-boys school that simply ignored the fact that they were teaching only boys or only girls would be an exercise in futility, and educators know it. Enforcing some `equalness' standards, then, would not only fail to clear the way for schools to try same-gender programs, it would very likely ensure the end of such efforts in the future. 
I would also note that the language of Title IX simply exempts admissions to same-gender public schools; it does not go on to say that this exemption only applies if a school meets either a comparability or an `equalness' standard. So ensuring that same-sex schools afford comparable opportunities for both sexes, as my amendment does, in fact strengthens the existing protections of Title IX against gender discrimination in schools. 
With regard to same-gender classrooms within co-ed public schools, the Department of Education requires that there be a sufficient showing that a single-sex class is necessary to overcome past discrimination against one sex. But this purely agency-created requirement is nowhere to be found in the language of Title IX, and is in fact contrary to the language and intent of the statue. It seems clear that Congress would not allow same-gender schools but prohibit same-gender classrooms, absent some onerous and ambiguous showing of past discrimination. This defies logic and the legislative history of Title IX. So, at least with regard to the use of the education reform funds identified in my amendment, I would seek to reverse this unnecessary and overly burdensome department-imposed requirement. 
In fact, it was our colleague, Senator Collins, who pointed out how burdensome this requirement really is. She recounted how she had visited an all-girls math class in Presque Isle, Maine. Despite the tremendous results she described in terms of watching girls really excel at 
mathematics, the school was forced to undergo a host of, as she described them `regulatory hoops' in order to be allowed by the Department of Education to continue to foster this success among girls in math. This is both unnecessary and unwise if we truly want to encourage achievement.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, small businesses are under attack in this country, and the United States government, through the National Labor Relations Board and other regulatory agencies, is aiding in this unprecedented assault. This battle is being waged against small employers by paid and unpaid union operatives who get access to non-union workplaces by seeking employment in these companies. Because employers are not allowed to refuse to hire union labor, they are usually hired. Once on job, these union agents put economic pressure on their employers by causing workplace disruptions that increase their employer's cost of doing business. This union guerilla warfare against employers is known as `salting.' 
The weapon of choice for these union operatives is to file unfair labor charges against their merit shop employers at the National Labor Relations Board or to file complaints against their employers at the EEOC, OSHA, or other regulatory agencies. Defending against these charges and complaints costs the employers in both legal fees and in lost time. As an added benefit, these cases often net union employees large damage awards or settlements because their employers can ill-afford the expense of defending themselves against the barrage of frivolous charges being filed against them. 
Consider the following examples: Gaylor Electric of Carmel, Indiana has had 96 charges filed against it. While each and every one of these cases has been dismissed without merit, Gaylor Electric has had to bear the cost of these cases to the tune of $250,000 per year. Likewise, hth Companies in Union, Missouri has had 48 unfair labor charges filed against it. Again, while all but one of these cases was dismissed, hth Companies has wasted $150,000 defending itself against these frivolous charges. Bay Electric in Cape Elizabeth wasted over $100,000 defending itself against 14 unfair labor charges--each of which was dismissed without merit. Wright Electric in Delano, Minnesota has lost almost $500,000 defending itself against 15 unfair labor charges, 14 of which have been dismissed, and one of which is still pending. 
In my home state, Little Rock Electrical, of Little Rock, Arkansas has been flooded with 72 unfair labor cases in just one year, 20 of which have already been dismissed, and 45 which have been set for trial. Finally, R.D. Goss in Clearfield, Pennsylvania has suffered the worst, having been hit with 20 unfair labor cases, all but one of which was dismissed--but which forced them out of business after 38 years. 
Mr. President, I support the right of workers to organize, and I am always reluctant to propose federal legislation that interferes in private matters--particularly private contractual relationships between employers and employees. However, in this case, as the above examples show, the federal government, particularly through the National Labor Relations Board, is wreaking havoc on merit shop contractors through this unfair, but legal, practice. 
Evidence as to the true nature and intent of union salting was best explained in the Organizing Manual of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), which stated that the true goal of `salting' is to:  
. . . threaten or actually apply the economic pressure necessary to cause the employer to . . . raise his prices to recoup additional costs, scale back his business activities, leave the union's jurisdiction, go out of business, and so on. 
Or, more bluntly, in the words of an IBEW organizing flyer, the goal is: 
. . . infiltration, confrontation, litigation, disruption, and hopefully annihilation of all non-union contractors. 
On February 13, 1997, I introduced legislation that addresses the issue of salting. This legislation, The Truth in Employment Act of 1997, would have allowed employers to reject an applicant that has no intention of actually working for the company, but who was instead solely interested in organizing and harassing their employer and fellow employees. Earlier this month, the House of Representatives passed their own version of the Truth in Employment Act, under the able leadership of Chairman Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania and Chairman Harris Fawell of Illinois, both of whom I had the privilege of serving with when I was a Member of the House. 
Today, I am introducing new legislation to address this issue of salting. My new bill, the Truth in Employment Act of 1998 is identical to the House passed version. 
Mr. President, the strength of this country rests on the freedom of individuals to pursue their dreams and ideas, and to risk their own capital to open and operate small businesses. Likewise, this country is built on the principle that workers are free to sell their labor, and if they deem necessary, to join fellow workers to negotiate higher pay or better working conditions. This measure will not undermine either of these legitimate rights. This bill only seeks to stop the destructive practice of `salting' to protect employers who operate non-union shops, and to protect employees who freely choose to work for these non-union employers. 
I would urge my fellow Senators to join our colleagues in the House and pass the Truth in Employment Act. The survival of America's small businesses demand that we act.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator from Georgia. 
I rise to speak in opposition to the Boxer amendment. My concern is that while there is, without doubt, an acknowledged need for after-school care and an acknowledged need for mentoring and tutorial-type programs, this would be taking the wrong step in the wrong direction and would create another Federal program, which, in my estimation, would be highly duplicative of existing programs, a multiplicity of Federal programs that already have been created for this purpose. 
School districts already have the authority to establish after-school learning centers, many already financed, and will benefit from additional provisions of this year's budget for after-school programs. 
Let me give just a few examples. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act provides $40 million for rural and inner-city public schools to establish after-school programs. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act allows money to be spent on after-school programs with a drug and violence prevention component. The child care development block grant and the community development block grant also provide money for child care, including after-school care. The Juvenile Justice Act will also target millions of dollars on prevention programs, including mentoring programs and after-school programs. It has already passed the House. These are just to give a few examples. 
So I, once again, must object to the philosophy underlying the Senator's amendment to create another Federal program. While I agree that one-on-one mentoring and tutoring is valuable, it will help improve educational achievement of students, such tutoring is already allowable under at least 19 other Federal programs. 
So I have listed a number of programs in which we have after-school care provided. There are 19 programs that have tutoring and mentoring components: AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve, VISTA, JUMP, the Juvenile Justice Mentoring Program, CAMP, the Migrant Education Mentoring Program, TRIO, are all examples of existing mentoring and tutoring programs that are out there 
already. 
The Senator's amendment, in my estimation, would simply duplicate these existing programs. In addition, we find there are a great many volunteer organizations that are providing and supplying after-school care currently. We are going to prohibit them, exclude them from the possibility of even applying for, competing for these grants. And so I think that is a serious, serious weakness in the amendment as well. Organizations like the YMCA would be ineligible to compete for the grants even though they currently are doing a tremendous job in providing after-school care in many cities and many school districts. So to say it has to be school-based, run through the school, I think would unfairly exclude those that are currently doing such a great job. 
The application described in Senator Boxer's amendment is a laundry list of paperwork. Read the amendment: identify goals, provide evidence of a collaborative effort, describe how the program would be administered, demonstrate how the activities will utilize or cooperate with programs, describe sources of other funds, provide a fundraising plan. All of these will require more bureaucrats, more administration, more reports, additional costs, and it would in all of that duplicate what we already have out there. 
I think it is the wrong thing for us to establish another Federal program when we have good programs there that need additional resources. We do not need to dilute that, diminish that by starting another Federal program for after-school care for tutoring and mentoring. 
So I ask my colleagues to consider this, do not just vote for an amendment because it has a good purpose, because it has a good goal in mind. Consider seriously that this program will be competing with a whole host of Federal programs already designed to meet this need in our schools and among our young people. I think that need is being met, and it would be a mistake for us to create more bureaucracy and a new Federal program. I hope my colleagues will oppose the Boxer amendment. 
I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding this time.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, this is an old formula to identify a problem and then you create a new Federal program that might solve it. 
There is a problem. There is a problem with after-school care. The solution is not to create yet another Federal program. We already have four existing programs that allow for after-school care. One of the problems with this amendment, or this program, would be that it would be school-based, school-run, and, therefore, prohibit scores of organizations like the YMCA that are currently providing for after-school care. They would be excluded entirely. 
There are 19 existing Federal programs that provide tutoring and mentoring for students on a one-on-one basis. So it is simply unnecessary to start a new Federal program at a price tag of $250 million. I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
While no one questions the sincerity of the desire of my colleague from Washington to lower the class size and the student-teacher ratio, I think it once again reveals the huge philosophic chasm that has been evident time and time again during this debate on education and the amendments that have been offered on the floor of the Senate, the difference between the approach and the philosophy that we can best do things controlled out of Washington, DC, that knowledge and wisdom flows from this city and this institution, and that we want to concentrate the power and the control over education in this country in Washington. 
The effort here to support the President's plan for hiring 100,000 new teachers at the Federal level, I think, is once again evidence that those of us who believe that there needs to be flexibility with local control cannot accept this as moving in the right direction. 
One size does not always fit all. While some schools may benefit from reduced class sizes, other schools may not benefit from reduced class sizes. In fact most teachers--most teachers --in this country are satisfied with current class sizes. 
For example, according to a survey by the Department of Education, 79 percent of the teachers in my home State of Arkansas are satisfied with current class sizes--79 percent. My sister teaches in public school in Rogers, AR. There are many things that my sister is not satisfied with about education in Arkansas. I know that is true of public school teachers all across the State of Arkansas. There are many things they would like to change and improve. But 79 percent said that that is one area that they currently are satisfied with, that the student-teacher ratio is not the big problem in education in Arkansas. 
Over three-quarters of the teachers in Connecticut, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wyoming are satisfied with the current class size ratio. 
Nationally--I would call the attention of my colleagues--nationally 65 percent of teachers are satisfied with current class sizes. So I suggest if there is a crisis in class size, if there is one group in this country that would know, it would be the teachers of this country. And the teachers of this country are saying that is one area where there is not a crisis. Thus the Washington-knows-best proposal to hire 100,000 new teachers does not make any sense. 
Class size does not always mean better education. Many schools with small class sizes have poor achievement results, and vice versa. For example, once again according to the Department of Education, Washington, DC, schools have one of the lowest average class sizes in the Nation but ranks near the bottom in academic achievement; while Utah ranks near the bottom in class size ratio but ranks very high in student achievement. There is not a direct and definite correlation. 
I further point out that average class size has already 
dropped significantly over the past 40 years and we have not seen a corresponding improvement in student achievement. Average class size has dropped from 27 to 1 in 1955, to 21 in 1975, to 17.3 today. Isn't it interesting that over the last 40 years, while we have seen class sizes consistently drop from 27 to 21 to 17.3, that student achievement scores--student achievement--have been dropping during that same 40-year period? 
Average elementary class size has dropped from 30.2 in 1955 to 18.5 today, a dramatic drop in class sizes on the elementary level, and once again we have student achievement scores falling at the same time. According to the Department of Education, most States already have average class sizes of 18 or less. 
Although elementary classes are a little bit larger, the national average now is 17.3, with the lowest being in New Jersey and Vermont at 13.8, and the highest being in California at 24 and Utah at 23.8 and Washington State at 20.4. 
The average elementary class size--18.5--due to demographics alone, is projected to fall over the next 10 years without any massive infusion of teachers from the Federal level. We will, because of demography, see the class sizes at the elementary level continue to drop. Many States, independent of the Federal Government, independently of anything we do, are already taking actions to reduce class size. My point being, we do not need a new Federal program to hire teachers when the States are already addressing this problem. We should not be imposing this from the Federal level. 
Five States--California, Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Wisconsin--have already taken dramatic steps to reduce class size by hiring thousands of new teachers in their States. These States are hiring teachers, and they are doing it with State dollars. 
Senator Moseley-Braun yesterday shared convincing pictures that her State needs to use Federal money, if it gets it, for school construction and repair. I do not agree with a Federal program to do that. But Illinois has an average class size of 17. Their great need, according to Senator Moseley-Braun, is not for an infusion of teachers. Their great need is actually in school construction. 
That is the beauty of the Gorton approach. That is the beauty of the dollars-to-the-classrooms approach. I have a bill we introduced that would ensure that the money actually reaches the local level and that the local decisionmakers have the right to decide where the need is and how that money should be spent. 
Washington, DC, needs funds for school repair, textbooks and other supplies in the District right here. The great need is not for more teachers in the Nation's Capital. The great need is school repair, textbooks, other supplies, perhaps computers. They already have an average class size of 15 in the District. And so what do we say? `Well, let's hire 100,000 new teachers.' That is not the great need here in our Nation's Capital. That is not the great need in the State of Arkansas. 
There are many needs in education, some of them being resource oriented. But for us to have a one-size-fits-all solution from Washington is not the direction we need to be going. 
A new Federal teacher program would further add to the paperwork burden that our teachers already complain about, thus increasing the true cost of this program and reducing its effectiveness. As we have heard so often in this debate, we provide 6, 7 percent of local school funding but we provide 50 to 60 percent of their regulations and their paperwork burden. 
So what do we come up with? Another Federal solution with more paperwork and more regulations on that local level. New Federal programs require new Federal bureaucrats to administer the program. We have already placed an enormously heavy burden upon those local teachers, and we don't need to siphon off scarce Federal dollars going to the States currently to start a new program hiring large numbers of teachers with Federal dollars. 
My sister, Gerri, teaches at the Reagan Elementary Public School in Rogers, AR. She reflects the attitude of 79 percent of the teachers in Arkansas that class size is not the big problem that she faces. Discipline, yes; many other needs, yes. Class size is not at the top of the list. Arkansas has made great strides. I think we rank 28th in student-teacher ratio nationally. Twenty-eighth is not great, but it is far better than we are in many other categories, including academic scores and the percentage going on to college and so forth. So while we have many challenges, we wouldn't put class size at the top of the list. We couldn't. I have never heard my sister complain once about the size of her class. 
I believe the Gorton amendment that we will vote on later today--the dollars to the classroom bill, legislation that I have introduced, that would ensure that 95 cents out of every dollar, Federal dollar, would actually reach the classroom and local control--is a far better approach. Allow local school boards, allow classroom teachers, greater discretion, greater flexibility on how those dollars are used, greater flexibility with fewer Federal mandates. Perhaps they need to paint the classroom. Perhaps they need to buy a computer. Perhaps they need to hire a tutor. Perhaps they have another local need. But what we don't need to do is to start a new Federal program and to hire massive numbers of new teachers from the Federal level. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Let me respond to a couple of points. The Senator from Washington said the figures I used speak of a number of adults in the school system. That is not the fact. The Department of Education has provided these figures, and it speaks of class size. Average class size has dropped from 27 in 1955 to 17.3 today. That is class size. It has dropped dramatically. And while it has dropped dramatically, student achievement has decreased. Twenty-one countries tested in the 12th grade math and science competency; the United States ranked 19th. There is no disputing our schools have problems, but it is also very evident that simply reducing class size, as we have done over the last 40 years, will not be the magic bullet. It will not be the panacea that suddenly is going to give us great academic achievement. 
What we do need is, in fact, greater local control, greater flexibility. The issue is not, as my colleague tried to make it, whether we will eliminate the Department of Education; that is a red herring, a straw man. 
The issue and the debate is whether we are going to provide greater flexibility and greater control at the local level, or whether we continue down the path that Washington, DC, is the fount of all wisdom, have all our solutions float from the Nation's Capitol, and it is so evidently demonstrated we don't solve the problem, and in many cases we simply exacerbate them. 
I suggest this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that is, while well motivated, ill conceived and takes us down the road of further federalizing education, placing greater mandates and greater burdens upon local teachers while not appreciably addressing the educational problems we face in this country. 
I ask my colleagues to consider there is a better way.

<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. There is no doubt we are facing a crisis in American education, a crisis that is putting us at risk economically. While it has been 15 years since the education alarm was sounded in this Nation with the report, `A Nation at Risk,' most indicators show that U.S. education is still desperately in need of repair. 
As I have suggested, mandating the hiring of 100,000 new teachers at the Federal level is not the right answer. I further suggest there is a better way, and that is the dollars to the classroom. If we can take the limited Federal dollars--and I think that is about 67 percent of local funding of the schools right now--if we can take those dollars and assure they actually reach the classroom, we will be far better off. Keep the local control. It will mean more money at the local level. 
So the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that I am offering as a perfecting second-degree amendment would simply say that we will make our efforts to ensure that 95 cents out of every dollar actually reaches the classroom. Right now, money does not reach the classroom. It is estimated between 15 percent and 35 percent of Federal funds spent on education never reaches the classroom. My colleagues, that is absolutely amazing. That is astounding, that 15 to 35 percent of Federal funds spent on education never reach the classroom. That is as much as $5.4 billion of taxpayer money targeted to education that will get lost in nothing but bureaucracy. School systems waste their own money on Federal paperwork. Federal paperwork burdens account for 50 percent of paperwork completed at the State education agencies, yet only 6 percent of their funds come from the Federal Government. 
Federal money is wasted--wasted over and over again. If we can take a look at this chart, we have a little example of where some of those Federal dollars are wasted. There are 21,922 publications listed by the Department. What are some of those publications that our tax dollars are being spent on? 
They include: 140 studies on checklists; 13 studies on welding; 260 studies on surveys; 100 studies on education researchers researching their research techniques; and 3 studies entitled `Cement: The Concrete Experience.' 
If there were any other evidence necessary to demonstrate that the solution doesn't come from Washington, DC, I don't know what it would be. This should be sufficient. Is it any wonder that only 65 cents out of every dollar actually reaches the classroom when we are spending Federal education dollars in these ways? Again, three studies were entitled, `Cement: The Concrete Experience.' 
We also spend Federal education dollars for closed captioning of programs like Baywatch, Jerry Springer, Jenny Jones, Hard Copy, and MTV's Real World. Those are some of the areas where I believe we are currently wasting valuable and precious tax dollars. 
So we find that between 15 and 35 percent of these funds are consumed at the Federal bureaucracy. So $5.4 billion of taxpayer money targeted to education will get lost in the bureaucracy. Federal money is wasted time and time again. The fact is that a large portion of Federal education dollars support this huge and growing Federal and State education bureaucracy. 
The question boils down to how we spend the money, not how much we spend. We throw money at problem after problem and find that the problems simply get worse. Even the President said this: `We cannot ask the American people to spend more on education until we do a better job with the money we have got now.' So I believe the solution--or at least a step in the right direction is the dollars-to-the-classroom proposal. The fact is that those closest to the students are the parents. That is the first and best `department of education' that has ever existed. And the teachers who spend every day in that classroom with those children and the school administrators know best the individual needs of the students. That is why I am offering this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
Under the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, we urge that 95 percent of Federal funds should go to the classroom. If 95 percent went to the classroom, each class would have an additional $2,094 to spend on their particular needs. 
I will show this chart to my colleagues. Under the dollars-to-the-classroom amendment, simply go through the figures. The number of students in K through 12 in the United States is 51.7 million. Elementary and secondary Department of Education outlays for fiscal year 1997, according to CBO, were $15.04 billion. The current estimate of above-mentioned dollars to the classrooms, the 65 percent that actually make it to the classroom under current policies, is $9.78 billion. The goal of the above-mentioned dollars to the classrooms, 95 percent, would be $14.29 billion that would get to the classroom. So the added dollars for use in the classroom are over $4.5 billion. That is without any new taxes. Without any new appropriations necessary, we would free up $4.5 billion for use in the classroom to be determined by the local school boards as to how that money could best be spent. That could be the hiring of additional teachers. It could be that in some school districts the great need is to lower classroom sizes. It could also be that they need to build a new school building or purchase some computers. It could be that they need to hire a tutor to help in a particular academic area. Additional dollars per student under this formula of 95 percent would be $89.23 per student. Average class size is 23.2 for teachers in departments, 25.2 for self-employed--approximately 24 children per class. If you multiply by 24, you come out with over $2,000 per classroom. 
I suggest to my colleagues that that is a far wiser approach than starting a new Federal program. The classroom is where learning occurs. It is where knowledge grows. It is not in some 
stuffy office in Washington where 35 cents out of every dollar is currently being spent. Thus, we should get the money away from Washington and drive it to the classrooms through that block grant approach that has been so ridiculed. We would be able to accomplish that, where local school boards or the States would be able to make those decisions. 
This resolution--it is only a sense of the Senate--lays the groundwork for getting education dollars to the schools, where local officials and parents and teachers can decide how best to spend the money. The question is, whom do we trust? Do we trust Washington, or local school boards, local schools, teachers and parents? A vote for this perfecting second-degree amendment is a vote for the classroom in your States and a vote against bureaucracy. That is the question. Do you want it down in the classroom or do you want to have another Federal bureaucracy hiring more teachers, another overlay, another step in federalizing education in this country? 
I ask my colleagues to support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution on dollars to the classroom, where the money can best be used, where the decisions can best be made. 
I reserve the remainder of my time, Mr. President.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as I began my remarks, I was not trying to play dirty pool, or something, as the Senator from Massachusetts has suggested. The rules are the rules. The rules allow me to offer a second-degree amendment. As I expressed at the very beginning, I think there is a big philosophic difference as to how we improve education in this country because I don't believe that a Federal program of 100,000 new teachers is the best way to do it. It doesn't mean that I somehow am playing dirty pool. We have a great difference of opinion as to what is the best approach. 
Everybody stands up and says what we want in this case is to just lower the class size and we are going to have better schools. No one deals with the figures. No one deals with the facts that I have given. I wish somebody would. The Department of Education gives us figures saying from 1955, when the class size average was 27 in this country until the current time when the average size is 18.5 in elementary, 17.3 overall, that we have seen class size drop now by over 10 per class size. During the same 40-year period, we have seen academic achievement decrease. 
Furthermore, I wish somebody would explain this to me. Here in Washington, DC, we have one of the lowest average class sizes in the Nation--13. Yet, our Nation's Capital ranks near the bottom in academic achievement. If this is the solution, why 100,000? Let's hire 200,000, if the solution to education in this country is getting class sizes down. Let's get it down to 10. But the fact is we have seen class sizes drop and drop and drop, and at the same time we have seen academic scores--nationalized achievement tests--drop and drop and drop. What do we do? Let's hire more teachers. That is bound to help. Yet, no one wants to deal with the issue. They just want to say this isn't right, that you should offer a second-degree amendment. 
By the way, I am so glad about the endorsement of the 95 cents out of every dollar going to classrooms. There is legislation that would do that. I expect now--as Senator Dorgan says--I don't think they actually will but I hope that we get the dollars for the classrooms and allow us to get that money to the classrooms. It is a better approach. 
In Utah, the State of Utah ranks near the bottom in class size. In fact, I think it was 48th in class size. Yet, they are at the top nationally in student achievement. 
But the way we are going to solve the school problems in this country is hire more teachers.

I resent the implication that somehow I have violated the comity of the process by offering a second-degree amendment which sincerely reflects my desire to address the education problems in this Nation in what I believe is a better way and my sincere--my sincere--reluctance to further federalize education in this country by hiring 100,000 new teachers with Federal funds. I think it is the wrong direction. 
I think it is the right of any Senator to come and propose a better way. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I appreciate the Senator from Oklahoma and his clarification on the amendment, the sense-of-the-Senate resolution of the Senator from Washington, because it is not clear whether these are Federal teachers, federally funded or not. It is clear now that it is Senator Murray's intention that this fulfill the President's request in his budget; that is $7.3 billion. 
We all want smaller class sizes. My point has been that we have been getting that. Mr. President, 27 was the average class size in 1955, 21 in 1975, 17.3 today. Class sizes are dropping. They will continue to. Demographically, we are told class sizes will continue to decrease. 
Furthermore, we know as well that many States are already addressing this problem. California, Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Wisconsin have taken dramatic steps to reduce class size on their own. Our whole point has been that 100,000 new teachers hired at the Federal level is not the best use of $7.3 billion. We would be far wiser in use of limited Federal resources to ensure that that money gets to the classroom, as opposed to starting another Federal initiative, another Federal effort. 
We know that our schools have problems. Mr. President, 25 percent of 12th grade scores were below basic reading in the 1994 NAPE test. The literacy level of young adults, 15 to 21, dropped 11 points between 1984 and 1994. That has happened simultaneous with smaller class sizes. We all want smaller class sizes. I think that is wonderful. But is that the best use of scarce resources? The answer is no. 
What is the correct answer is to provide maximum flexibility with the fewest possible mandates, ensuring that the highest percentage possible of those dollars gets to the classroom. That is what my amendment does. That is what the `dollars to the classroom' proposal is all about--more money to the classroom with fewer regulations and fewer controls from the bureaucrats in Washington, DC. I think most Americans agree with that, I think most schoolteachers agree with that, and I am sure most parents agree with that proposal. 
So I ask my colleagues to vote for this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It expresses their reluctance, skepticism about another Federal program hiring another 100,000 teachers for our local schools.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, this is a dollars-for-the-classroom amendment that expresses the sense of the Senate that we will do our best to ensure that 95 cents out of every dollar actually gets to the classroom where the needs are the greatest. Unfortunately, studies indicate that right now as little as 65 cents of every Federal education dollar actually gets down to the classroom. Where does it go? Much of it goes to bureaucracies, Federal and State. We have 307 Federal education programs. 
This simply says let's give 95 cents out of every dollar to the classroom. That will be $2,000 per classroom for every classroom in America--additional money that the teachers and the local school boards can determine how it should be spent. It maximizes local control. States' needs are different. To say 100,000 teachers or to say let's spend Federal dollars for construction isn't the wisest approach. It is better to let those decisions be made locally where the needs differ across the country. 
The question on this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is, Are you for bureaucrats, or are you for books? I think we want it to go to the classroom. Let's support this sense of the Senate. 
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, this amendment calls for 100,000 new teachers paid for at the Federal level. It is an endorsement of the President's proposal. I reluctantly oppose it. Mr. President, 79 percent of the teachers in Arkansas are satisfied with class size, 65 percent of the teachers nationwide are satisfied with their class sizes. It is wrong to have a one-size-fits-all approach on the Federal level. We may need more teachers in some States, but we may not need them in others. So I believe this is an area States are already addressing, 
California and many other States have adopted programs to reduce class size. It is not something the Federal Government needs to get involved in. It has a $7 billion price tag. Those funds can be better used, and more wisely used, in other areas. So I ask my colleagues to oppose this sense-of-the-Senate resolution endorsing the 100,000 teacher, $7 billion expansion of the Federal role in public school education.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, yesterday's papers were replete with stories praising the People's Republic of China for releasing Wang Dan, a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstration at Tiananmen Square which was crushed by China's military. This release follows, by less than six months, the release of Wei Jingshen--arguably China's best known human rights dissident. While these are certainly positive developments, it is important to note that both of these releases are tainted by the fact that neither dissident was allowed to stay in their own country, but were instead exiled to the United States for `medical treatment.' These exiles conveniently allow China to gain favor with the United States while simultaneously allowing them to silence two of their loudest critics by banishing them to the United States. 
Mr. President, the truth is that China appears to be using its dissidents as pawns in an international game of chess with the United States to gain military, technological and other favors from the Clinton Administration. In fact, the release of these two prisoners appears to be payment for the United States decision not to support a resolution condemning China's human rights record at the recently completed U.N. Conference on Human Rights and for the United States certification of China to join a pact on ballistic missile technology. It is amazing that this great country, which has long stood beside political prisoners around the world, is willing to be a player in China game of siphoning out political prisoners in return for international favors. 
Let us not forget that the People's Republic of China continues to have one of the worst human rights records in the world. A record that includes torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced abortion and sterilization, crackdowns on independent Catholic and Protestant bishops and believers, brutal oppression of ethnic minorities and religions in Tibet and Xinjiang, absolute intolerance of free political speech or free press, and most recently, the harvesting and selling of human organs. 
Likewise, let us not forget that China continues to threaten its neighbors, most notably Taiwan and let us not forget that China continues to violate international agreements on non-proliferation, having recently been caught negotiating to sell chemicals to Iran which could be used to produce weapons-grade uranium. 
Mr. President, we must end this deadly and humiliating game with China, and demand the immediate release of the hundreds, if not thousands, of political, religious, and labor dissidents currently imprisoned in China for having peacefully expressed their beliefs and for having exercised their basic human rights. This list includes the likes of Gao Yu, a journalist sentenced to six years in 1994; Chen Longde, a leading human rights advocate serving a three year `re-education' sentence which began in 1995; Li Qingxi, a unionist arrested in 1998, and many, many others. While I hope that the recent release of two of China's most notable dissidents was just the beginning, and that the remaining political prisoners held in the People's Republic of China will soon be released, I see little evidence that this is the case. 
Therefore, I urge my fellow Senators to support my Sense of the Senate Resolution calling on the President to demand that China release all such prisoners prior to their upcoming U.S.-China summit meeting, and that the President report to this body on the progress being made by the administration in securing the release of these prisoners immediately following this planned summit. 
Mr. President, this is a reasonable resolution--a resolution that once again puts this body on record supporting those that would give up their freedom in support of the freedom of their fellow countrymen. I can think of no more important issue. I thank my Senate colleagues for their support.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, if I might just explain the amendment. There are two major provisions to the amendment. One would say that until we are able to replace this Tax Code, we need to restructure and reform the IRS. Senator Roth has done a marvelous job in highlighting the abuses of the Internal Revenue Service. This puts us on record, in the sense of the Senate, that we should as expeditiously as possible provide taxpayer protections. 
The second major provision is that we should set a date certain in which this massive, incomprehensible Tax Code will be sunsetted, and we will have a replacement code written 6 months in advance of that. 
We give the sense of the Senate in those two respects. 
This chart in the Washington Post shows what we did in the Taxpayer Relief Act regarding one provision, IRA rules. We complicated it from this to this. The American taxpayer knows that. We need to simplify, we need to reform the IRS. And there is nothing irresponsible about setting a sunset date on sunsetting the existing Tax Code. 
We sunset the ISTEA bill, we sunset the higher education bill, we sunset the farm bill. But we just add to, and add to, and add to the Tax Code. We have elections. We have a process. We have hearings. We will have a responsible process by which we write a replacement code and the American people will come to a consensus. 
I ask your support for this second-degree amendment.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, 15 minutes ago, 59 Senators voted in favor of what I think all of us support: reforming and restructuring the IRS and protecting the taxpayers to a date certain on sunsetting the Tax Code that no one in this country defends. 
Do not be fooled. This amendment is a second-degree amendment offered by my dear colleague from North Dakota that would undo much of what we just did. We don't want to undo that. There is nothing in the sense of the Senate that we just adopted that would threaten in any way charitable deductions or home mortgage deductions or any of the other particular aspects of the current code that you may like. It would say that on a date certain we are going to have a new code that is fairer and simpler, more comprehensible to the American people, and that it is a tax code that they deserve. 
I ask my colleagues to reject this second-degree amendment designed only to undo what we just expressed to the American people--that we believe the IRS is out of control and that we have a code that needs to be simplified and that needs to be made more fair. 
I ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment.

It expresses support for the charitable tax deduction and the homeowner deduction. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of Senator Dorgan's second-degree amendment.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I wish my good friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, had been able to stay because he called this the most 
irresponsible piece of legislation that he has heard of during his time. This isn't about applause lines and not about flat taxes or flatter. It is about whether or not we are going to vote to defend the status quo, whether we are going to vote to defend an incomprehensible monstrosity called the IRS Tax Code. 
I want to begin my remarks by just quoting the words of James Madison in Federalist Paper No. 62 when he said: 
It will be of little avail to the people. . .if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is today, can guess what it will be tomorrow. 
I think if he were writing today, he would be talking about the IRS Tax Code being incomprehensible. The biggest issue raised against it is that it is going to cause uncertainty if we repeal it, if we sunset it, and that it is going to cause uncertainty. 
Mr. President I can think of no greater expert on the economy or the effects of public policy on the economy than Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. All of this `the sky is falling,' all of this fearmongering, all of this rhetoric that this is going to somehow cause economic chaos--Mr. Greenspan said, in testifying before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in 1995: 
Sunsetting is a very important process for both regulation and various different types of legislation. 
He was asked: 
If we're talking about sunsetting regulations, should we sunset taxes as well. . .? 
He responded: 
I cannot find reasons why all programs should not have specific time-certain ends to them and be required to be reauthorized. 
He went on:  
After a period of years, I would say yes to that. I would say all institutions of a democratic society should be reviewed. . .the presumption that institutions should not be reviewed periodically in a democratic society is a mistake. 
Mr. President, we just passed in this Chamber a transportation funding bill, the ISTEA bill. We would not have done it had it not been sunsetted, had it not expired, had it not had to be reauthorized. We would have never forced ourselves to do it. 
Today I spent most of my day in a higher education reauthorization markup. We did that because the last one is expiring, because it was sunsetted. We do that on spending bills all the time--the IDEA bill. Why should we not also do that on bills on the Tax Code that has become so incomprehensible to the American people? 
Senator Bumpers, my good friend from Arkansas, said it is the height of irresponsibility to sunset something before you know what you are going to replace it with. I am so glad--I am so glad--that our Founding Fathers did not adopt such a position. To say that you cannot pass a law until a new law is ready to replace it ignores the rich history of this country that was founded by a group of freedom lovers who signed the Declaration of Independence 12 years before the Constitution was 
drafted and implemented. Surely we can do that with just one title of the U.S. Code. 
To say that it is the height of irresponsibility--can you imagine our Founding Fathers saying, `Well, it's very irresponsible for us to declare independence before we know what the Constitution is going to look like or before we know what the Government is going to look like or before we know what the Tax Code is going to look like.' 
We know one thing. We may not know, I say to my colleague, whether we want a flat tax, sales tax, value added tax, or some other hybrid, but we, as the American people, know that of what we have, we deserve better, that this serves no one, and the April Fool's joke is to defend this Tax Code, which is the nightmare for the American people 2 weeks before they reach this deadline. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no on this resolution which would delete this important sunset provision sense of the Senate from our budget resolution. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue. 
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

 Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and honor a young Arkansas school teacher who made the ultimate sacrifice for one of her students. 
Children often think of their teachers as heros. And there is no better word than `hero' to describe a courageous woman named Shannon Wright, a thirty-two year old English teacher at Westside Middle School. Shannon died in the tragic schoolyard shooting Tuesday along with four students. In the hail of gunfire, she gave her life in order to protect an eleven-year old girl, Emma Pittman. Emma says she believes Mrs. Wright saw the bullets coming and shielded her from being hit. Shannon was shot twice while she tried to protect the young girl from injury. 
In the words of Emma Pittman's mother, `I feel she needs a hero award for saving our child. I want her family to know how grateful we are because she didn't think of herself--she thought of the children.' 
While Shannon will forever be remembered as a hero, it will be extremely difficult to ease the pain her death has brought. Shannon Wright was not only a teacher, she was a mother, a daughter, and a wife. She left behind her husband of twelve years, Mitchell, and her 2 1/2 year old son Zane. Her life was devoted to serving others, and she was deeply loved by her family and her many friends. The loss of Shannon Wright will be mourned not only by those whose lives she touched everyday, but by the entire Jonesboro community, the state of Arkansas, and people throughout our nation. 
This horrible act of violence has caused incredible pain for the people of Northeast Arkansas. We grieve not only for Shannon Wright, but for the four girls who were killed, Natalie Brooks, Paige Herring, Stephanie Johnson, and Brittheny Varner. It's impossible to understand why such a tragedy occurred, especially in a schoolyard. While it seems that nothing good could ever come from something so terrible, Shannon Wright's death taught her students and the rest of us an incredibly important lesson about the power of selfless action. Shannon Wright's selfless action saved a young girl's life. 
Shannon Wright will always be remembered as a hero who gave her life to protect the children.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I was interested in things that my good friend, the Senator from Connecticut, said. He said that the standard we were setting for Mexico was a standard of perfection. He said that twice, as if we had held up some impossible standard for Mexico to meet. Well, if you look at the text of the Presidential determination certifying Mexico, signed by President Clinton, it is not a standard of perfection that we ask of Mexico. It is this:  
I hereby determine and certify that Mexico has cooperated fully with the United States, or has taken adequate steps on their own to achieve full compliance with the goals and objectives of the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs. . .. 
That is the standard--`cooperated fully and taken adequate steps.' I suggest to my colleagues that we have a moral and a legal obligation to measure this vote by that standard. It is not some standard of perfection. It is a standard of whether they have fully cooperated and whether they have taken adequate steps. I further suggest that if you look plainly and clearly at the compelling evidence, by every standard and measure Mexico has failed to fully cooperate and they have failed to take adequate steps. 
The government of Mexico has yet to extradite or surrender a single Mexican national to the United States on drug charges, despite the fact that there are 27 outstanding requests. In fact, no Mexican national has been surrendered. 
The Bilateral Border Task Force, which was described by the administration last September as the `cornerstone of U.S.-Mexico cooperative enforcement efforts' has yet to become fully operational, and has been completely ineffective. This failure is due to a lack of funding by the government of Mexico, corruption, and the failure of the Mexican Government to allow DEA agents to carry weapons. Is this what we consider `cooperating fully and taking adequate steps?' 
According to the Deputy Attorney General testifying before Congress, `None of the senior members of the Arellano Felix Organization (AFO) has been arrested.' In short, the AFO, part of the Tijuana Cartel--the second most powerful drug cartel in Mexico, continues to operate unimpeded. Is this what we consider `taking adequate steps?' 
Mr. President, the answer is obvious--the Government of Mexico has not cooperated fully in this most important war for the lives of our citizens, and has not taken adequate steps to engage in this war on their own. 
In fact, seizures of metham- phetamines in Mexico in 1997 was less than one-fourth the levels attained in 1996 and seizures of heroin have been cut in half. In all, Mexico's record of drug seizures this past year are far short of adequate and are best characterized as a dismal failure. 
Coupled with these poor seizure rates, the number of drug related arrests were down in 1997--and were almost a third of the arrests made in 1992. Again, not adequate, but wholly inadequate--not progress but retrogression. 
The failure of the Government of Mexico to move against the major drug producing and transporting Mexican Cartels, their failure to make significant drug seizures and arrests, and their failure to cooperate fully with U.S. counter-narcotic efforts has led to a dramatic increase in the supply of drugs entering the United States. 
The results of these failures are both known and predictable. As the supply of drugs goes up, their prices go down. Street prices for cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines are at their lowest levels in years--making these deadly drugs more affordable for our children and more available for the troubled addicts lining our country's shattered neighborhoods. This cheap price may be why heroin use is increasing so rapidly--with those under the age of 25 being the largest new heroin user population. Likewise, according to the administration, cocaine use is again on the climb. With the new users falling in the age of 12 to 17. 
Mr. President, there are real faces of real children behind these stark numbers. They live in urban and rural in Arkansas, and across the country. This was is one that we cannot afford to loose. Drugs are the hidden impetus to much of this country's crime, poverty and violence. Every day more children start down the drug path to ruin. If we lose this war, it will be lost on the backs of our children and our families. 
Today's debate is too important to call a totally inadequate effort--adequate! We must not lower our standards in this test of international will to win the war on drugs. Based on the facts, I would urge a vote for the resolution to decertify Mexico. 
If words have meaning at all, and they do, Mexico has failed--they have not taken `adequate steps' and they have not `cooperated fully.' If the annual certification of Mexico is anything more than an empty political exercise, one must vote to decertify in view of the clear and convincing evidence. We must not be like the ostrich--head in the sand--pretending everything is O.K. 
Mr. President, honesty demands a yes vote on this resolution to decertify. 
So, Mr. President, I could go on and on. Senator Feinstein did it very well. By every measure, Mexico has failed. It is not a standard of perfection. Have they cooperated? Have they taken steps? They have not. We do not have not some fantasy obligation; we have a moral and legal obligation. If words mean anything, we must judge Mexico simply by whether they have cooperated and whether they have taken adequate steps. And they have not. 
My friends, if this is anything more than a political exercise that we go through every year, anything more than a political joke, we have a moral and legal obligation to vote yes on this issue of decertification. 
I thank the Senator from Georgia for the time.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for yielding time. 
Mr. President, for the last 4 years this Congress has been engaged in an intense debate on this country's trade relationship with the People's Republic of China. On the one side of this debate are those who view the abhorrent and declining human rights conditions in China as a cause for revoking the special trade treatment currently given to Chinese-produced goods. On the other side of this debate are those who view free trade as a paramount virtue and believe linking trade with human rights is an inappropriate foundation on which to build our national trade policy. Last month, the two sides of this debate came colliding together in one chilling event, the indictment and arrest of two Chinese `businessmen' for trade in human body parts harvested from executed prisoners in the People's Republic of China. 
Trade and human rights, delinked by our Government, were unalterably linked together by this tragic event last month. This arrest, more than any other event, brings the human rights crisis in China to the feet of those kneeling at the altar of free trade. No longer can free traders, the Chinese Government, or this administration turn a blind eye to the gruesome conditions now prevalent in the People's Republic of China. In matters related to trade with China, we must now move beyond the issue of trade deficits and move on to the issue of moral deficits. In particular, this country and this Congress must strongly reconsider the moral basis of our special trade relationship with this repressive regime. 
The history leading up to last month's arrest is telling. For years, human rights organizations charged that the Chinese Government was at the center of an international market in human organs harvested from Chinese prisoners. The Chinese Government denied these reports, charging that these accusations were malicious and conspiratorial and outrageous. They totally rejected the charges. 
Then, in 1994, the British Broadcasting Company, the BBC, aired a documentary detailing its evidence concerning China's trade in body parts. Again China issued a strong denial. Representative Chris Smith held a hearing on this issue in 1996. The Chinese Government again stood firm in its denials. 
Then, last year, confronted with hidden video captured by ABC's `Prime Time Live' documenting an actual transaction of a kidney, complete with footage of the military hospital in China used to harvest the organs and of a U.S. business which operated a kidney dialysis unit in China to facilitate the transaction, even in spite of this, China stood ever stronger in its adamant denial. 
When I visited China in January of this year, when I raised this issue, once again it was dismissed out of hand as being a fabrication of the opponents of China. 
The Chinese policy of lies and denials and distortions relating to its involvement in the marketing of human body parts may work well in the court of public opinion, but it will fail, I believe, in the court of law. With the arrest of Wang Cheng Yong and Fu Xingqi, the Chinese Government and its sympathizers will have to rethink their party line. More important, this Government will have to rethink the credence it gives to the word of the Chinese Government and its spokesmen. It is now certain that, in China, the judge, the executioner, and the profiteer are all wrapped in one. 
As the Washington Post editorialized in the wake of these arrests, `the Clinton administration long ago abandoned human rights as a primary consideration dealing with China. . . .' But even Stanley O. Roth, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, had to admit that if prisoners were being killed in China in order to provide organs, `it would be among the grossest violations of human rights imaginable.'

Mr. HUTCHINSON. This case only builds upon the repeated efforts from Chinese dissidents, Amnesty International, and the U.S. Department of State concerning the declining human rights conditions in China. 
Again, as the Washington Post reported last month, these human rights abuses include `torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced abortion and sterilization, crackdowns on independent Catholic and Protestant bishops and believers, brutal oppression of ethnic minorities and religions in Tibet and Xinjiang and, of course, absolute intolerance of free political speech or free press.' 
Mr. President, how long must this list of oppression get before this Government acts? 
The increased arrogance of China's leadership in the face of the world's silence is evident in President Jiang's statement late last year that `both democracy and human rights are relative concepts and not absolute and general.' 
Accepted absolutes are now considered relative by China's leadership. This brutal Communist regime has now decided to determine the moral parameters within which civilized countries can stand within its judgment. In short, religious persecution, organ harvesting, and torture are now within the bounds of moral behavior in China. The unacceptable is now acceptable and the inhuman is now humane. While the world stands silent, China has managed to redefine the very nature of what is right and what is wrong. 
Last week, I and 11 of my Senate colleagues sent a letter to President Clinton to remind him of his promise to the American people to `step up efforts, in cooperation with other states, to insist that the United Nations Human Rights Commission pass a resolution dealing with the serious human rights abuses in China.' 
On Wednesday, under the able leadership of Chairman Helms, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee adopted a resolution submitted by Senators Mack and Wellstone expressing the sense of the Senate denouncing the human rights conditions in China. This resolution, which we now debate and which we will soon vote upon, and which I believe this body will adopt overwhelmingly, as did the committee, criticizes the People's Republic of China and asks for the U.N. Commission on Human Rights to pass a resolution acknowledging what is going on in China today, and for this Government to make that request of the United Nations. 
While it is far short of the effort I believe should be made, it is a welcome first step in the right direction. I commend Senator Wellstone and Senator Mack for their outstanding leadership on this, and Senator Helms and all of those on the committee who voted 16 to 1 in favor of the resolution. 
If I might just close with this--and I know I have taken longer than I had requested--when I visited China in January--and I can spend an hour or much longer talking about those 10 days in China--the most moving moment was on a Sunday morning at 7:30 a.m. when I went to Tiananmen Square where, all of us remember so vividly almost 9 years ago, the images came across our TV sets through CNN cameras, and we saw those tens of thousands of students who stayed there for months peacefully asking their government to improve human rights conditions and to democratize the largest nation in the world. 
While I was in China, I had a chance not only to visit Tiananmen Square and see that red banner that still flies, but to visit Ray Burghardt who was charged to be in Beijing at the time of the massacre when the Chinese Government, the hardliners, won out and the troops and the tanks moved in. He spent 3 hours over dinner telling us about the events leading up to the massacre. 
He said on the night that the tanks moved in, the Chinese Communist Government waited until 2 in the morning. They did not want the world to see what was about to happen. The floodlights that showered over the many, many acres of Tiananmen Square were turned off. They did not want to see any cameras rolling. 
As the troops moved in and the tanks moved in, he said from the Beijing Hotel, watching through binoculars, that he could see, as the troops came out, as the weapons were fired, the profiles of the students as they fell. The silence continued, broken a few moments later by more gunfire, more students falling. Through those morning hours, the massacre continued. 
By the time the Sun came up the next morning, the tanks had cleared the mall. They had cleared Tiananmen Square so that no one was to know, so that no one would have a hint of the massacre, of the thousands who died in the surrounding blocks, or of the tens of thousands who lost their lives. 
Those students looked to the United States as the emblem of freedom, as the shining city on a hill. They built a 30-foot model of our Statue of Liberty and it, too, went under the tanks as they rolled in. 
I just ask my colleagues, as they vote for this resolution, to remember what those students were fighting for, what they were standing for and to whom they looked as the symbol of freedom. I ask for a good vote, a solid vote, and a message to the world that we still stand for freedom. 
I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his indulgence.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, yesterday, while millions of American households across the country were struggling to understand which of the 480 separate IRS tax forms applied to them, while they were trudging along, trying to read through the accompanying 280 supplemental explanatory IRS pamphlets, while their tax accountants and tax attorneys worked hard to keep them abreast of the more than 800,000 words which make up this country's Tax Code, and while families nervously anticipated the impending IRS deadline of April 15, which is now less than 6 weeks away, President Clinton had the audacity to call my efforts to sunset this country's incomprehensible maze that we call a Tax Code in the year 2001--irresponsible. 
Following his speech, President Clinton's chief economic adviser Gene Sperling equated my bill, the Tax Code Termination Act, with `reckless river boat gambling.' Worse yet, President Clinton's Deputy Treasury Secretary stated, `We have a Tax Code today that works better for Americans as they do what is crucial to them in their lives.' He said that the Tax Code works for Americans. 
No; Americans may feel they work for the Tax Code. They surely do not believe that the Tax Code works for them. In short, the President and his advisers were telling the American people in the midst of their `tax season migraines,' that this Tax Code works just fine. Are the American people to believe that President Clinton and his economic advisers do not see anything wrong with Americans spending a combined total of 5.4 billion hours--the equivalent of 2 full work weeks--complying with tax provisions? 
Are Americans to believe that their President does not see anything wrong with the Tax Code that costs this country more than $157 billion per year? Is it possible that the President and his key advisers see nothing wrong with spending $13.7 billion per year enforcing the Tax Code, yet the IRS fails to provide correct answers to taxpayers seeking assistance almost one-quarter of the time? 
I think the American people will be able to decide who is being irresponsible and will be able to easily separate the `river boat gamblers' from the sincere legislators working to better their everyday lives. 
President Clinton's criticism of the Tax Code Termination Act centers around the notion that one should not set a date to sunset a law until a new law is written and ready to replace it. Doing so, in President Clinton's eyes, would be irresponsible. Well, is it irresponsible to sunset this country's transportation programs, which spend over $23 billion per year, before a new transportation program is written and ready to be put into law? Is it irresponsible to sunset this country's higher education programs before a new law is drafted? Of course not. In fact, right now this Congress is in the midst of debating a new transportation spending program and a new higher education program for one simple reason. When these major spending bills were passed and signed into law, they contained sunset provisions which terminated these programs 5 years after they were implemented. In fact, every major spending program currently on the books contains similar sunset language. 
The truth of the matter is that President Clinton doesn't mind sunsetting provisions when the law allows the Government to spend billions of dollars in taxpayers' money. The President does not mind sunsetting Head Start, doesn't mind sunsetting Pell grants or school lunches. Sunsetting only becomes irresponsible to this President when the law being sunset deals with provisions which take money from the pockets of hard-working Americans. 
The Tax Code Termination Act is anything but `irresponsible.' This act simply sets a date certain, well into the future, when the Tax Code will need to be reauthorized, which will simply place taxes and spending on equal footing. This bill will force Congress to completely rethink how we collect hard-earned taxpayer money and, as with major spending programs, it will allow a healthy debate to ensue on the merits, effectiveness and efficiency of the law as it is currently written. 
Why is the President afraid to treat taxes and spending equally? Why should sunset provisions only apply to one but not the other? Maybe it is because the President knows that this tax system cannot withstand close scrutiny--that it can't even stand cursory scrutiny. Maybe the President is afraid that Americans will feel empowered to force this Congress to rethink the amount and methods used to take their hard-earned money. Maybe the President is afraid that he will lose the power to hide tax provisions that benefit favored special-interest groups deep within this large and complex Tax Code? Finally, the President stated yesterday that the Tax Code Termination Act would create uncertainty--skillfully 
noting that `uncertainty is the enemy of economic growth.' Mr. President, is there any certainty in this system? Can one be sure that despite trying diligently to comply with this complex and incomprehensible tax system, one still won't be dragged into court and fined for failure to accurately comply with every jot and every tittle of the Tax Code? Can one be certain that they haven't overpaid or underpaid, that they haven't missed a deduction that is owed them or claimed a deduction for which they don't qualify? 
No; the only thing certain about this system is that it guarantees one's rights can be trampled by an overempowered IRS and that one's economic freedom can be jeopardized by overzealous tax collectors. 
While the President claims that his opposition to the Tax Code Termination Act is to protect business by ensuring them a long-term landscape on which to make major business investment decisions, most business-led tax organizations actually support our efforts to terminate this Tax Code. The National Federation of Independent Business, Citizens for a Sound Economy, and others know firsthand how many billions of dollars per year they waste trying to understand this Tax Code, much less comply with the Tax Code. They see their profits eaten up by tax lawyers and tax accountants. They know full well that the real uncertainty is in the current code, not in any distant sunset of the current code, and they know that the Tax Code Termination Act will create a clean slate on which a fairer, simpler Tax Code can be built. 
I am certain that when and if President Clinton attempts to take this debate outside the beltway, he will quickly learn who is being irresponsible; he will quickly see where the American people stand on this important issue. 
Finally, the Tax Code Termination Act, sponsored by myself and Senator Brownback of Kansas, is currently supported by the entire Senate Republican leadership and is being cosponsored by 26 fellow Senators. I urge the President to rethink his position, and I urge my fellow Members to get behind this effort and take the first step in simplifying our Tax Code by setting a date certain that this code will expire. 
It is one thing, Mr. President, to be cautious. It is one thing to be prudent. It is quite another to be controlled by timidity and frozen into inaction. As my colleagues have said, the Tax Code has had its place in history, now we need to make it a part of history. I ask my colleagues to join me in that effort. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. 
Mr. President, our economy is doing well. Over 13 million new jobs have been created in the last 5 years and unemployment is at a 24-year low. The engine behind this growth is America's entrepreneurs. Last year, over 840,000 new small businesses were started in this country adding to the 22 million small businesses already in existence in the United States. 
Not only are new jobs being created at an astounding rate, but job satisfaction levels are on the rise as well. While these statistics are good news for America, they are a bitter pill for America's labor unions. Because of the strong employment conditions, unions are finding it increasingly difficult to identify workplaces that feel they need labor representation. In short, union membership is in a free-fall. 
Last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that unions lost 159,000 members in 1997 alone. Union membership has declined from 14.5 percent of the work force to 14.1 percent this year. This drop in membership is hitting the unions where it hurts most, their pocketbooks. Unfortunately, rather than fighting back with legitimate, honest organizing tactics, unions are lashing out against America's merit shop employers with tactics aimed at undermining their very existence. 
Mr. President, I am always reluctant to propose legislation that interferes in private matters, particularly matters that deal with contractual relationships between employers and employees. However, in this case, the Federal Government, through the National Labor Relations Board, is a coconspirator in this union attack on small businesses. 
For example, Little Rock Electrical Contractors, which is a merit shop contractor in my home State that hires both union and nonunion labor, has found itself on the barrel end of several unfair labor cases filed by workers the company has no record of ever even having hired or even interviewed. 
Last year, George Smith of Little Rock Electrical Contractors testified before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, on which I serve, that they often settle these meritless cases simply because of the cost of litigating them through the NLRB and the courts, which is a very, very expensive process indeed. 
Mr. Smith said that his business cannot compete against the flood of cases that are filed against them and which are being litigated by Government lawyers working for the NLRB. Rather than fight, they simply pay. In the end, this not only hurts the employer but it hurts employees and consumers who bear the brunt of this cost in lower wages and in higher prices. 
Mr. President, unfortunately, this case is not unique. Both the House and Senate Labor Committees have been flooded with testimony showing similar efforts by unions across the country to harass and intimidate employers whose employees have chosen not to organize. Interestingly, this practice, which is known as `salting,' rarely, if ever, results in a formal petition to organize. In fact, the true nature and intent of salting was best explained by Mr. Gene Ellis, an IBEW organizer, who wrote in the Maine Labor Record the following words. And I quote:  
We've had members get monetary awards in the thousands of dollars just for applying for a job, just a couple hours of effort. At this writing, I'm pleased to announce that five of our members will be sharing in $32,000 of BE&K's profits. All for just filling out an application. 
On February 13, 1997, I introduced legislation that addresses the issue of salting. This legislation--called the Truth In Employment Act of 1997--would allow employers to reject an applicant that has no intention of actually working for the company but is instead solely interested in disrupting the workplace and harassing their employer and fellow employees. 
Today, I am introducing three new bills which seek to further protect small businesses from stern and intimidating union practices by forcing Government bureaucrats to seriously evaluate the actions they take against America's small businesses and requiring that the NLRB expeditiously resolve cases that are 
brought before it. 
First, I am introducing the Fair Access to Indemnity and Reimbursement Act. The FAIR Act will provide small businesses the incentive they need to fight back against meritless claims brought against them with the assistance of the NLRB and its team of lawyers. 
Simply put, the FAIR Act will allow small businesses to recoup the attorney's fees and expenses it spends defending itself should they prevail. So if a charge is brought against them, and they defend themselves and prevail, they will receive their attorney's fees. This will put some disincentive into the current practice of filing absolutely meritless cases in the hopes that they will tie up and disrupt the workplace and eventually destroy the employer. It ensures that those with modest means, the small company, the small business man or woman, will be able to fight frivolous actions brought before the NLRB--making the agency's bureaucrats closely consider each and every case before they initiate litigation. 
Mr. President, passage of the FAIR Act would be welcome news to small businesses across America. In particular, John Gaylor of Gaylor Electric from Indiana, who budgets $200,000 each year to combat frivolous labor charges brought against him, would finally be able to recoup a large portion of these annual costs and would be able to reinvest this money into his business and into the welfare of his employees. 
Mr. President, the second bill that I am introducing is the Justice on Time Act. This legislation eliminates another obstacle small business must cross before they can consider fighting meritless cases brought before the NLRB. It currently takes the National Labor Relations Board an average of 546 days--546 days--to process unfair labor claims. This delay compounds the back pay rewards that businesses must pay if they are found to be in violation of the National Labor Relations Act. 
Furthermore, it delays the reinstatement of employees who are in limbo waiting to learn if they will get their jobs back. The Justice on Time Act is reasonable legislation that will force the NLRB to resolve unfair labor cases involving the dismissal of an employee within 1 year. And 1 year ought to be long enough. 
Finally, Mr. President, I am introducing the Fair Hearing Act which will require the NLRB to conduct a hearing to determine the appropriate bargaining unit in cases where labor organizations attempt to organize employees at one or more facilities of a multifacility employer. 
The NLRB, at the behest I believe of organized labor, has recently considered regulations that would end the NLRB's decade-long practice of resolving disputes over what constitutes an appropriate bargaining unit in an open hearing. While the NLRB recently pulled its proposed rule ending the use of hearings, and replacing it with a fairly broad set of `union favoring' criteria, the Fair Hearing Act would ensure that this practice is never again jeopardized by bureaucrats at the National Labor Relations Board. 
Mr. President, these three bills simply seek to level the playing field on which organized labor and small employers compete. The strength of this country rests on the freedom of individuals to pursue their dreams, to pursue their ideas and risk their capital to open and operate a small business. With a level playing field, these dreams can continue to be met and can continue to be realized. 
The three bills that I am introducing today will help ensure that the efforts of small business men and women across this country are not hindered by intrusive and misused Government regulations. I ask my colleagues for their consideration and support of this legislation.

<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I join Senator Brownback in the introduction of the Tax Code Termination Act today and will explain a little bit about our motivation and our rationale for what I think will prove to be very historic legislation. I heard it said that a tax form is a lot like a laundry list, either way you are going to lose your shirt; and a lot of folks have lost their shirts dealing with this code right here, the Tax Code that we believe needs to be terminated, needs to be eliminated, needs to be pushed over the cliff, giving us a clean slate to start over again. 
Today's laundry list of tax provisions which now comprise 480 separate tax forms, requiring an additional 280 supplemental, explanatory pamphlets, is causing taxpayers to not only lose their shirts but to lose their patience. So what we have here is only the beginning. Because, in addition to this, there are the tax forms and there are the 280 supplemental explanatory pamphlets that accompany and explain and try to make rational, try to make understandable, what to most is incomprehensible. 
Taxpayers are frustrated that they must spend a combined total of 5.4 billion hours complying with the provisions of this Tax Code--5.4 billion hours. That's just a number to most people. Most people can't conceive of the number `billion' or exactly what that means. It is the equivalent of 20 hours a year for every man, woman, and child in America to comply with this Tax Code. A family of four will spend the equivalent of 2 work weeks, just for Tax Code compliance. I think you begin to understand how expensive it is, what a drag it is upon the American economy, and how much wasted time there is for productive Americans who could be using that time in better ways. 
The American people are troubled that mere compliance with tax laws is costing the economy over $157 billion a year, and they find it absolutely incredible that the Federal Government itself spends $13.7 billion per year enforcing this code, enforcing the tax laws. Yet, in spite of the fact that we are spending, on the Federal level, $13.7 billion enforcing the tax laws, one out of every four calls to the IRS will get a wrong answer. The Internal Revenue Service itself doesn't understand this Tax Code that we are asked to operate under. 
Unfortunately for taxpayers, and even for overburdened IRS employees, the Tax Code continues to grow and become more Byzantine every year. As the chart to my right shows, the number of words comprising the Tax Code grew from 235,000 words back in 1964, to almost 800,000 words in 1994. That is an increase of over 300 percent. This complexity has led to a veritable cottage industry of high-priced lobbyists. In fact, it is interesting, as you look at the chart, to see the parallel between the increase in lobbyists--in 1964, about 10,000, between 10,000 and 20,000--to almost 70,000 lobbyists that we have in Washington, DC now. So as we have seen the explosion in the words of the Tax Code, we have likewise seen an explosion in the number of the lobbyists up here who are lobbying on behalf of one particular provision or another that benefits their particular special interest. 
Even the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which I supported because of the sizable substantive real tax cuts that it provided to middle-income families, continues the trend to complexity of the Tax Code. This act added several new forms and resulted in over 830 changes to the Tax Code. So it is no coincidence, when the Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law last year--a bill that I voted for that provided the first tax cut in 16 years--but when it was signed into law, H&R Block, the national preparation service, saw their stock jump 20 percent. Since then it has increased 50 percent; to a great extent, I think, because of what we did here in Congress in the passage of a bill that further complicated an already overcomplicated Tax Code. 
Worse yet, as this chart indicates, the marginal tax rate for typical families with a child in college varies widely under the current Tax Code. As it was pointed out by two economists for the American Enterprise Institute, for typical families with incomes between $10,000 and $120,000, the marginal tax rates bear a strong resemblance to the New York City skyline. If you use your imagination, you can see the skyline of New York City in this chart. 
The results of this system are unacceptable. Taxpayers making between $11,000 and $30,000 should not pay higher marginal tax rates than those earning between $30,000 and $40,000. Likewise, taxpayers making between $80,000 and $100,000 should not pay higher marginal tax rates than those earning above $120,000. It is fundamentally unfair. Yet, while we in Washington debate the merits in the flat tax, the tiered progressive tax, the national retail sales tax, the modified flat tax, the VAT tax, all the various tax proposals that have been presented to Congress with all their various advocates and all their pros and cons, the New York City skyline tax continues unfettered. 
Today, I am glad to join Senator Brownback in the introduction of legislation that will force this Congress to address this inequality. Like a city block that has fallen into disrepair well beyond the patchwork repairs of urban developers, our legislation would level the current skyline tax and leave a clean slate on which to build a new, fairer, and simpler Tax Code. It is not enough for us to continue to tinker with this Tax Code. It is not enough for us to merely pass IRS reform legislation, though I support that and I will support further legislation to protect the rights of American taxpayers. But all of that is really incremental. All of that is really just nibbling around the edges. We must be much more fundamental in our approach to comprehensive tax reform, and it begins with establishing a sunset date, a date certain in which the American people can with certainty understand and realize that the unfairness and undue complexity and Byzantine nature of the current Tax Code will be eliminated once and for all. 
Many have claimed that this national movement to terminate the Tax Code is irresponsible, in spite of the fact that millions of Americans have joined this movement. Hundreds of thousands have already signed petitions, called, e-mailed, written letters to their Representatives demanding that we terminate this Tax Code or `scrap the code,' as some have said, or `explode the code,' as others have even more graphically expressed themselves. 
There are those who would say that in spite of that, that the move to terminate the existing Tax Code is an act that is irresponsible. These critics have warned that the Government cannot just scrap its Tax Code without knowing how it is going to be replaced. I believe what these critics fail to realize, is that almost every major spending program of the U.S. Government terminates every 5 or 6 years. Part of the wisdom of how we operate in this Congress is that when we establish a spending program it is for a certain period of time with a termination date, a sunset date; and subsequent to that termination date, it follows that there will be a debate and there will either be reauthorization or the termination of that program. Whether it's Head Start, whether it's the school lunch program, the student loan program, or the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, ISTEA legislation, which we are going to right now on the reauthorization--all of them expire, all of them terminate, and must be reauthorized. So, far from being irresponsible, this termination process forces Congress to reconsider the effectiveness and efficiency of these major spending programs before they can be replaced. 
In short, the Tax Code Termination Act places Federal taxes on the same footing as Federal spending. It will allow us to clean the slate, and on that clean slate, Congress will be able to write a smaller, simpler, fairer Tax Code for the American people. In the end, the Tax Code will be taken to the cleaners and the taxpayers will get to keep their shirts.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, imagine, if you will, that your daughter is given an assignment by her teacher which requires her to keep a journal, not just a journal of her own intimate and very private thoughts, but of answers to questions that have been posed to her by her teacher. Should you as a parent have a right to know what questions the teacher has posed, what questions the teacher has asked? 
Now imagine that a research team from a local university is given permission by your child's school to perform psychological exams on your son or daughter. Should you as a parent in that situation have a right to approve of this exam before it takes place? Should you as a parent at least be informed about the impending exams? 
Finally, Mr. President, imagine that your son is required to take a class in `decisionmaking' which you are concerned may include discussion of issues that might violate or be contrary to the teachings you have espoused and inculcated in your children in the home. Should you, in that circumstance, as a parent have a right to review the classroom material prior to enrolling your children in that particular class, in that decisionmaking class? 
In each of these three examples, the clear and, I think, the obvious answer is yes, parents, as those to whom primary responsibility for the education of their children is entrusted, should be allowed to know what questions their children are being asked; parents should have the right to decide whether or not their children are examined psychologically; parents should have the right to review their children's curriculum. 
Unfortunately, the above examples are not just random hypotheticals that I dreamed up or that I had my staff dream up. These are real-world examples of how public schools are currently usurping the rights of parents to be informed about the education of their children. 
Mr. and Mrs. Robinson from Sheridan, AR, have yet to learn what questions were posed to their daughter by her teacher in an in-class journaling assignment. Parents in Monroeville, PA, have yet to obtain their children's records maintained as a part of a research project run in their children's school by the University of Pittsburgh. Parents in California have been forced to go to court to view the curriculum being used in their local school for a class that they fear may delve into deeply personal matters. 
How can this be the case? How can we have this situation in a country founded on the principles of freedom, in a country that has always respected the parents' ultimate authority in the rearing and education of their children? How can parents be denied basic information relating to their children's education? 
The answer may lie in a book recently published by Eric Buehrer entitled `The Public Orphanage.' In this book, Mr. Buehrer points out that public schools have become `one-stop social service agencies' attempting to address the needs of children that were traditionally the responsibility of the children's parents. 
Whether this trend is the errant result of a legitimate attempt to fill the void left in children's lives with the breakdown of the American family, or whether this trend is part of a more sinister philosophy based on belief that `Washington or Government knows best,' it is a trend that is leading to lower educational achievement and to less clearly defined standards of right and wrong for our Nation's children. In short, I think it is a trend that we should not allow to continue. 
The importance of parents in the education of their children was clearly emphasized in 1994 by Secretary of Education Richard Riley in testimony before the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. In this testimony, Secretary Riley, I think very powerfully and poignantly, emphasized that `Thirty years of research tells us that the starting point of American education is parental expectations and parental involvement with their children's education' and that schools must `establish a supportive environment for family involvement.' 
Despite this important parental role, Secretary Riley pointed 
out that `many parents feel that their right to be involved in school policy--to be full participants in the learning process--is being ignored, frustrated or even denied.' In short, Secretary Riley noted that many parents simply do not feel `valued' by the schools that educate their children. 
So today, I am introducing legislation that will value the role of parents in educating their children. It will help to establish a supportive environment for families by guaranteeing parents a place at the table in decisions central to the creation and implementation of education policies within their local schools. 
This legislation builds on the already well-established principles outlined in the 1974 Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, which ensures that parents have access to all records which public schools maintain on their children. The Parental Freedom of Information Act, which I am introducing today, will strengthen the rights of parents by guaranteeing them access to the curriculum being used to teach their children. Current law, the 1974 law, ensures that parents will have access to the records and files that are maintained on their children. But we need to go a step further. We need to build on that successful 1974 legislation by ensuring that parents also have the right to access the curriculum being used to teach their children. I think it is a reasonable provision which allows parents to review their children's textbooks, audio-visual materials, manuals, journals, films and any other supplemental material used to educate their children. 
On the surface, one would think this legislation shouldn't be necessary. I think most Americans assume that parents already have the right to go into the school and ask to see the books, ask to see the curriculum materials, ask to see the supplemental materials, ask permission to view a film that might be shown to their children, to look at the journals that are in the library, and to have basic access to all of the information and all of the curriculum materials being used in the education of their children. But unfortunately, the record is now replete with examples of where parents have run into a stone wall and have met stiff resistance when they have tried to obtain that kind of basic educational information. Information which is so essential to the education of their children. 
So we say on one hand, we want parents to be supportive, we want parents to be involved, we want parents to attend PTA, we want them to attend parent-teacher conferences, we want them to show by their actions that they are actively involved in the education and upbringing of their children. We don't want our public schools to be social orphanages that take care of the children from breakfast until supper. 
Then, on the other hand, we allow policies to be enacted in local schools across this country that resist that very desire by many parents, that make it difficult, if not impossible, to access critical materials being used in the education of their children. 
The Parental Freedom of Information Act will provide parents access to curriculum and to the testing materials administered to their children, and it will require parental consent prior to any student being subjected to medical, psychological or psychiatric examinations, testing or treatment at the school. 
This legislation is very basic and straightforward and, I think, is just plain common sense. This legislation will empower parents by providing them access to the information they need to oversee and direct the education of their children and will slow, and hopefully reverse, the establishment of schools as public orphanages. 
I look forward to pursuing this legislation in committee and with my colleagues in the Senate.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as I listened to the speeches and the various tributes to Ronald Reagan and the speeches that are in favor of this legislation to name the Washington National Airport after former President Ronald Reagan, I had not intended to speak today. But I was moved by some of the tributes that I have heard. I was dismayed by noticing the opposition to this legislation--surprised and dismayed. And I thought there was little I could add to some of the glowing tributes that we have heard except my own personal experience because I think in many ways I like many of my generation owe to Ronald Reagan the inspiration and the motivation to go into the whole sphere of the political arena. 
In 1964 I was in junior high school living in the northwest corner of Arkansas. My parents were not particularly political. But I watched the news and followed closely the political events that year and the election campaign between Lyndon Johnson and Barry Goldwater. I remember--I think it was about 10 days before the election that year--watching on our black-and-white television in Arkansas a speech by an actor by the name of Ronald Reagan. I remember sitting on the floor in front of the black-and-white television mesmerized as I listened to what later became known to a whole generation of young people as `The Speech'--`A time for choosing,' it was called--in which Ronald Reagan so eloquently laid out for the Nation the choice that faced America in that campaign and a philosophic choice that faced Americans down through the ages. 
And there is a junior high schooler listening to Ronald Reagan make that speech, a speech that historians say was the launching pad, if you will, for his political career, a speech that propelled him to a meteoric rise in politics, from the Governorship of California to the Presidency of the United States. I think it also propelled a whole generation of young people to look at politics as something noble, as something of a great adventure, as an arena in which truly a difference could be made in the lives of our fellow citizens and the future of our Nation.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I would like to read just the closing two paragraphs of Ronald Reagan's speech in 1964 on behalf of Barry Goldwater, a speech that obviously did not turn the tide in that election but a speech that started his political career, a speech that inspired me to become involved in the political process. He concluded that speech, the speech in 1964 with these words: 
They say the world has become too complex for simple answers. They are wrong. There are no easy answers, but there are simple answers. We must have the courage to do what we know is morally right. 
You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for our children this, the last best hope on Earth, or we will sentence them to take the first step into a thousand years of darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and our children's children say of us we justified our brief moment here. We did all that could be done. 
I cannot say it as Ronald Reagan said it, but his words still have the power of great meaning, and what an inspiration it was to a Nation. And so when he became President of the United States, this great communicator and great optimist infused in us again the feeling that America can be and is a great Nation. 
With the Reagan tax cuts, the economic recovery that it spawned, with his repair of our neglected defenses, with his courageous and bold stand to say the words that everybody criticized him for when he called communism, `The Evil Empire,' as a result of that and his willingness to stand at the Berlin wall and say to Mr. Gorbachev, `Tear this wall down,' it sewed the seeds for what became the collapse of the old Soviet Union and most of communism in the world. 
And then perhaps no incident I think reflects the greatness of this man and his impact upon us and how he buoyed us as a people: Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, all Americans how he raised our spirits, inspired us and inspired a Nation than when on January 28, 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded just after takeoff, disintegrating into a ball of flame before a world television audience. The disaster understandably stunned America. Never before had the dangers of space exploration been brought home as graphically and as visibly as they were that day. The intensive prelaunch media attention had caused the world to know these seven crew members as we knew few other astronauts. We knew them with an unusual intimacy, and now they were gone. The Nation was staggered. 
Then Ronald Reagan took to the airwaves. The President of the United States delivered a 5-minute speech, and he concluded his 5-minute speech by quoting the words written by a Royal Air Force pilot shortly before his death in the battle of Britain, those words that we will remember: 
For I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth and touched the face of God. 
President Reagan's short speech of 5 minutes, concluding with those words, unified and uplifted and encouraged a heartbroken America. 
Tip O'Neill, who was Reagan's political adversary, tough political adversary, with whom he had many fierce arguments and disagreements, later that very day described the moment in which Reagan made that inspiring speech to America. He said, and I quote Tip O'Neill, `Reagan at his best.' It was a trying day for all Americans and Ronald Reagan spoke to our highest ideals. 
May I say, Tip O'Neill said it right because Ronald Reagan always spoke to our highest ideals. This is a very small tribute but a very fitting and appropriate tribute that we name this airport after one of our greatest Presidents and one of our greatest living Americans, Ronald Reagan. 
I thank Senator Coverdell for his leadership and his willingness to take on this project, and I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding. First, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Nebraska and his excellent analysis of the efforts by our government to federalize not only education, but many other programs as well. And I applaud Senator Coverdell from Georgia for his efforts in the area of education, and in particular, his leadership on the Better Opportunities for Our Kids and Schools Act, the BOOKS Act. I believe this bill demonstrates that we, as Republicans, have a deep concern about education in this country. We have a deep concern about improving education for our children, who are precious to us. And we recognize that this is best done at the local level, where teachers know the names of our kids, and can pick up the phone and call the parents when the need arises. These decisions are better made at the local school district level, the State level, and not by a greater and bigger Federal bureaucracy. 
Last evening, in his State of the Union Address, the President proposed `the first ever national effort to reduce the class size in the early grades . . . by hiring 100,000 new teachers.' So I ask, is this really a genuine effort to reduce the size of our children's classes? Or is it just another exercise of ever bigger Government, and a move in that gradual effort toward federalizing education in this country? 
Why are new teachers, mandated from Washington, the ticket to smaller class sizes? It is well-documented that many States across this Nation have taken on the responsibility of reducing the size of their classrooms; namely, California, Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Wisconsin. The Governors of these five States have proposed hiring thousands of new teachers using, not Federal dollars, but State dollars. This makes sense, allowing individuals closest to our children to make these kinds of decisions. 
Madam President, I trust those individuals in the thousands of 
cities and towns across this country who know your child's name, to make the important decisions that impact the very classrooms in which our children learn much more than I trust bureaucrats in our Nation's capital. In an effort to allow States and localities to make these decisions, I, as part of the BOOKS legislation, will be introducing the Dollars to the Classroom Act, that will redirect about $3 billion of K-12 education dollars to the States, requiring only that 95 percent of that money actually reach our children's classrooms. This money can be for books, it can be for teachers, it can be for computers--whatever the local education officials deem necessary and important to the education of our children. 
While no one can deny the importance of providing the best possible education to our children, we also must implement these programs in the most responsible manner: by returning control over the education of our children to the place that it belongs, the parents and teachers and local communities and local school boards. By doing that, we will ensure that education dollars are spent wisely on programs and activities which really benefit our children in the classroom. 
Currently, the vast majority of all Federal education funding does not go to school districts or classrooms. In fact, in 1995, of the $100 billion the Federal Government allocated for education programs, only about 13 percent actually got to the local level from the Department of Education. That is a travesty, and a national nightmare. 
Madam President, the current system of Federal bureaucrats attempting to administer hundreds of education programs to our children is, to say the least, highly inefficient, as reflected in falling test scores and increased illiteracy rates. 
Many students are not adequately prepared to meet the challenges of life beyond high school, whether they go on to college, take a job, or attend a trade school. In fact, last year alone, 43 percent of high school seniors scored below the basic level in science, while 29 percent of all college freshmen were required to take at least one remedial course. Most alarming is that 68 percent of employers say that high school graduates are not prepared to succeed in the workplace. These statistics paint a very sad picture in a country which prides itself on having the best education system in the world. When limited Federal funding is spread so thin over such a wide area, the result is ineffective programs that fail to provide students with the basic skills they need to succeed. 
So I ask my colleagues to join Senator Coverdell and my good friend from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, and I, in asking hard questions. Which do our constituents really prefer? In whom do the citizens of America really place their confidence? The real question is--is it going to be BOOKS, or is it going to be bureaucrats? So why not let those on the State level, why not let those on the local level, who best know the needs of our children, make those decisions, make those determinations? Perhaps it is books, perhaps it is computers, or perhaps it will be a need for more teachers so that children will have smaller class sizes. But I truly believe that those decisions must be made at the local level. 
I believe the alternative, the Dollars to the Classroom Act, demonstrates not only our commitment to the education of our kids, but also proves that there is a better way to implement this commitment rather than creating an ever-growing Federal bureaucracy and appropriating ever-larger sums of money which are failing to provide for the real needs that our schools have. 
So, once again, I applaud Senator Coverdell for his leadership in education, his leadership on our efforts to improve education for all of the children in this country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Department of Veterans Affairs Employment Discrimination Resolution and Adjudication Act. As we approach Veterans Day, it is indeed fitting that this important legislation will soon become an integral part of title 38, of the United States Code. 
This legislation addresses the critical issue of sexual harassment within the Department of Veterans Affairs and ensures that the rights of all employees will be protected. I would like to recognize the leadership of Chairman Specter and the support of Senators Rockefeller and Graham in the development of this necessary legislative remedy. 
Specifically, this bill creates within the Department an Office of Employment Discrimination Complaints Resolution which will be headed by a director who shall be solely responsible for resolving complaints of unlawful employment discrimination within the Department. It requires that those employed in handling the complaints be properly trained and that complaints are handled in a fair and objective manner. The legislation further ensures that those individuals in top management positions are held to the same standards concerning equal opportunity employment law as those individuals that they manage and supervise. 
The legislation requires that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs submit to Congress three reports on the implementation and operation of the equal opportunity employment system. These reports are due April 1, 1998, January 1, 1999, and January 1, 2000. In addition to the reports required of the Department, the legislation further stipulates that an assessment of the Employment Discrimination Complaint Resolution system be conducted by an independent contractor who has been approved by both the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees. The first independent assessment is due June 1, 1998 with the second report due June 1, 1999. 
Mr. President, our Nation's veterans and the over 200,000 Federal workers who support the nationwide network of the Department of Veterans Affairs programs and services must be assured that they can put veterans first in an environment that has zero tolerance for any type of sexual, emotional, or physical harassment.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. First, may I say I am glad that I am able to join my distinguished colleague from Missouri. 
When he speaks of `statesmanship' on the issue of foreign policy, I think he exemplifies that term. 
To answer the Senator's question, I think it is unfortunate that after the summit the whole issue of human rights has really taken a back seat to commercial interests and that the attention that has been given to human rights is primarily attributable to those who have been willing to protest the presence of Jiang Zemin in our country, coming to the United States with the kind of attention at a state dinner, with a 21-gun salute, and with the red carpet treatment he has been accorded. 
So I am glad for those who have pushed the issue of human rights. 
The President was praised yesterday for chiding Jiang for the human rights record in China. But I think the chiding at whatever level it may have occurred and to what extent it may have occurred is greatly undermined when it is accompanied by 21-gun salutes, red carpet treatment, and state dinners, that, in fact, the ultimate end result of this summit will be to give greater acceptance of the Chinese Communist Government and greater willingness to accept and condone the oppressive practices that have become characteristic of this regime. 
So instructive engagement has degenerated, I am afraid, into an exercise of appeasement. I think `appeasement' is a very strong word to use. But when we look at the last 4 years, I think it is not too strong a term to use to describe what the administration's policy has been. 
The logic behind constructive engagement, as my colleague well knows, has been that expanded trade would lead to political liberalization and that economic freedom frequently leads to political freedom. 
I have had meetings with a number of dissidents this week from China, the most famous of whom in this country is probably Harry Wu. When I raised this issue with Harry Wu, I said, `Harry, when they talk about economic liberalization leading to political liberalization and that trade ultimately always leads to political liberty if we will just give it time, that greater trade opportunities, the higher standard of living, and what they experience with economic prosperity has to ultimately lead to political liberalization and greater freedom,' his response was if the administration were sincere in that, if they were genuine in that conviction, why not use that in North Korea, why not use that in Cuba? If, in fact, trade ended totalitarianism, we would be practicing that in other places. 
I would be delighted to yield to my colleague.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. So the administration's decision not even to consider human rights abuses when dealing with China has proven, I think, disastrous for the people of China and they have been removed from the threat of any repercussions; that is, the Chinese Communist government in their trade relationship with the United States and the Chinese Communist leaders have succeeded in jailing every last dissident in a country of over 1 billion people. So rather than seeing expanded liberties, we have seen those contracted by the jailing of every last dissident as our country has turned a blind eye to the atrocities that have escalated, and the oppressive government in China has strengthened its hold on fully what is one-fourth of the world's population. 
Since the United States formally delinked American trade with China from its human rights performance of abuse, much has changed, but nothing has changed for the better. 
I had in my office yesterday--I share this with the Senator from Missouri--a number of Chinese political dissidents, democracy dissidents, those who had raised their voices on the side of freedom. One was a former editor with the People's Daily, a Communist Chinese newspaper. He resigned that position because they would not allow him to speak the truth. 
But the one I remember the most and that made such an impression upon me was the young man who said that on the very day that President Clinton announced his policy of delinking in which he said no longer will we tie human rights abuses and violations to our attitude toward trade with Communist China, it was on that very day that they came and rounded him up and his incarceration and his prison term began. 
So the policy of constructive engagement has simply failed. It has produced more persecutions of Christians, more forced abortions, more sterilizations to the mentally handicapped, more incarcerations of political dissidents, and the near extinction of the expression of any opinions contrary to that of the Communist regime. 
I participated yesterday, I believe it was yesterday, in the `Adopt a Prisoner of Conscience' Program that began on the House side in which Members of the House and Senate were invited to adopt a particular individual who today is languishing in a Chinese Communist prison for no other reason--not because they robbed a bank or because they mugged somebody, or they robbed--for no other reason than they had expressed their own conscience contrary to that of the Communist government. 
The `prisoner of conscious' whom I adopted, and whose name I do not seek to say, was charged with this crime: Helping Christians. That was the charge. That is why he is incarcerated. The date of release is unknown. How long he will stay in prison we don't know. But his crime was simply helping Christians. 
So I suggest, as I yield to the Senator from Missouri, that this policy of constructive engagement has failed, and at some point, if time allows, I would like to talk about how this foreign policy contrasts so poorly with the very firm foreign policy that we had under Ronald Reagan.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I was impressed with the Senator's comments as he reminds us of what Jiang has said concerning rights, that they are relative, that they are not absolute. And how do you deal, how do you negotiate, how can you trust a leader that has that concept of liberties, and how that contrasts in fact with our own Founding Fathers--the attitude that they seem to have that rights are like aspirins to be dispensed as needed by the government and to expand or to contract as the situation may require? 
The ideals of the American Revolution were not narrow. They were not culturally limited appeals without relevance beyond our shores. Our Founding Fathers recognized that when God gave rights, when the Creator gave rights, he didn't just give them to Americans; that he gave them to all human beings. And so the efforts of the Chinese leadership to depict Western democracy as being only a Western phenomenon, that it is a Western cultural thing like business suits or like eating with knives and forks is I think contrary to the reality that in fact rights are absolute and that civil liberties, that human rights transcend cultures and they transcend societies and they even transcend various forms of government. 
The young students in Beijing 8 years ago who defied the tanks, I say to the Senator, were not there making papier-mache models of Chairman Mao but of Miss Liberty. They didn't quote from Marx. They were quoting from Thomas Jefferson. And we may not be able to save the lives of every young, brave student in the world, but we should always make it clear that our prayers and our policies are on the side against the tanks of terror and that we should never sell out his cause of freedom for trade opportunities. 
I recall, as does the Senator, when the copyright issue came up with China and that China was violating American copyright laws. It was at that point that the administration threatened sanctions against China. When I was talking with Harry Wu, he replied as only Harry Wu could, that copyright equals sanctions, human rights 
equal no sanctions. And I think it really puts in perspective the attitude of the administration that profits seem to be more important and will bring greater repercussions and consequences with the Chinese Government than will the violation of human rights. 
I thank the Senator.

country. I hope he reads well the words that are inscribed in the Liberty Bell because it is from the Scriptures. I think it is from the Book of Deuteronomy. It says, `Proclaim liberty throughout the land.' I hope he takes it to heart, that this is a concept he needs to bring back to China, and there is much he can do, starting with no longer jamming Radio Free Asia. If he believes in liberty, let the message of freedom come into his country. 
Among the dissidents I met with this week was an elderly Tibetan lady who had been arrested and spent 28 years in prison. She said that all of those who were arrested when she was arrested are now dead. And she said she has asked repeatedly, why only her? Why did she live? Why did she survive those 28 years in prison? And as we met right over here in the Foreign Relations Committee room, she looked around--there were 10 Senators there, and she looked at those Senators and said, `That's why I survived, so I could tell my story.' 
I thank Senator Ashcroft for helping tell her story to the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination of William E. Kennard to the Federal Communications Commission [FCC]. The telecommunications industry has seen incredible technological advances made over the last two decades. As a result, the responsibilities and scope of the FCC have increased dramatically. Today, it is more important than ever for FCC Commissioners to be able to respond and adapt to these changes in a timely manner. 
Recently, the FCC issued a regulation that will have a profound impact on the trucking industry nationwide. While ordinarily one would not think of an FCC action having an adverse impact on trucking companies, such is not the case in this situation. On October 9, the FCC issued a regulation implementing a provision of last year's Telecommunications Act, which directed the FCC to provide for adequate compensation of pay phone operators. The new FCC regulation ordered long-distance companies to pay payphone owners 28.4 cents per call for each call to a toll-free number unless the payphone owner and the long-distance company have a contract specifying a different rate. The charge applies to both customer toll-free numbers and to company access numbers, including those on prepaid calling cards. The charge became effective immediately. 
Long-distance carriers, in turn, are passing this charge along to their customers. The carriers are not limited to a set charge and as a result the amount being charged varies depending on the carrier. 
Pay phones are the life line between the Nation's 3.2 million truck drivers and their home offices. A driver will call in numerous times during the day and in most cases will talk no longer than 2 minutes. Nevertheless, under this new rule, the trucking company will be charged each time a driver calls in. 
Arkansas has been fortunate to have a significant trucking industry based in our State. Some of the largest trucking companies in the Nation are headquartered there. This new regulation will have a devastating effect on their business costs. For instance, in the case of J.B. Hunt Trucking, it is estimated that this new regulation will increase the company's phone bill by approximately $200,000 a month. This will equate to $2.1 million annually. 
Smaller trucking firms have also contacted me and said their phone bills are projected to double under this new rule. A small business is completely unable to absorb an increase of this magnitude. 
When it comes to using payphones, the trucking industry is virtually a captive consumer. There is no real alternative and no option to avoid paying what is, in effect, a very expensive tax. 
Mr. President, we need to explore alternatives to provide some relief to this industry. I will be contacting the FCC Commissioners to work with them on this problem and I would encourage my colleagues to do the same.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I rise today, on the eve of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's official state visit to the United States. I rise today because I believe that, while it is important to continue relations with a country that contains one-fourth of the world's population, it is also important for us to remember that this one-fourth of the world's population--these 1.2 billion people--suffer today under an oppressive regime committed to a violent suppression of dissent, a regime which steadfastly refuses to recognize inalienable human rights, a regime which uses imprisonment, torture, and execution as tools to forge a society that is void of individual liberty. 
It is a regime that has a government program to market human organs and body parts, using the execution of prisoners as a profit method for the Government of China; a regime that systematically jams Radio Free Asia. While coming to the United States and professing their belief in liberty, they systematically jam the expression of freedom that this country subsidizes, underscoring its importance by broadcasting throughout Asia. 
Yet, with all of these facts, all of this evidence, the United States rolls out the red carpet for President Jiang Zemin of China, the same leader who was named General Secretary of the Communist Party 3 weeks after the protests were quelled with violence and bloodshed in Tiananmen Square. This is the same leader who is the hand-chosen successor to Deng Xiaoping, the so-called Butcher of Beijing. He is the same Communist leader who, in a 1990 interview, only a few weeks after the Tiananmen Square massacre, in an interview with Barbara Walters described the Tiananmen killings as, and I am quoting President Jiang Zemin, `much ado about nothing.' This is the Communist leader who, in an interview published in the Washington Post just last Sunday, continued to defend the Tiananmen Square massacre and suggested the violent crackdown on peaceful demonstrators was the price of allowing economic reform in China. Madam President, this is the Communist leader who is traveling throughout the country like a king. 
Nothing underscores the differences we have with President Zemin more than his recent comments on the subject of human rights. Earlier this month, as he prepared to come to the United States, President Zemin said, `Both democracy and human rights are relative concepts and not absolute and general.' That bears repeating. President Jiang Zemin said about democracy and human rights, they are not absolutes, they are not something that is essential, something that is God given, something that is basic to being human beings. But, he says, they are relative concepts. 
As citizens of the United States, the great foundation on which our country was built is the undeniable and unchanging principle that all mankind is created equal, and that we are endowed by the Creator with certain unalienable rights. Those rights attend to us as human beings, whether we live in China or whether we live in the United States. Nothing is more central to our understanding of the role of government. President Zemin and the Chinese leadership flagrantly reject this and over 1 billion Chinese know oppression and fear and violence as part and parcel of their daily lives. I would say to President Zemin that human rights are not the possession of governments, to be dispensed at the will or the discretion of those who wield power. Human rights is not, as he has insisted, a relative concept. It is a transcending value that crosses cultures, societies, and forms of government. Liberty is not the province of America, and to my colleagues and to this administration I would say that our defense of freedom must not stop at our own shores. 
The values which we cherish as Americans we must defend for people everywhere. We always have. The Great Wall that separates our governments today is the great wall of human rights violations. I hope the President and the leadership of Congress in their meetings with President Zemin this week will, frankly and forcefully, communicate the deep sense of anger and the deep sense of outrage that is stirred in this country by the ongoing human rights abuses in China. 
It is time for straight talk with the Chinese leadership. It is time for an American foreign policy guided by a commitment to the cause of freedom. I urge the President to remember the words that he spoke in December 1991 as he campaigned for the office which he now occupies. Candidate Clinton in 1991 said, in reference to the Bush administration: 
The administration continues to coddle China, despite its continuing crackdown on democratic reforms, its brutal subjugation of Tibet, its irresponsible export of nuclear and missile technology, and its abusive trade practices. 
He accused the Bush administration of coddling China because of these circumstances within China--brutal subjugation of Tibet, irresponsible export of nuclear missile technology, and crackdown on Democratic reforms. He said, because of that, the Bush administration is doing too little. They are coddling China. I ask the President, what has changed? The only thing that has changed is the condition of the Chinese people and the oppression under which they live every day. Conditions are worse by every measure and by every standard. Things have gotten worse in China. Yet the administration has totally changed its position. The position of the President has changed. The condition of the Chinese people has changed also, but only for the worse. 
I believe that China's flagrant disregard for human rights should be enough. But, since our policies toward China have not changed, the human rights abuses continue to take a back seat to a foreign policy that seems to be driven by profit projections. The administration now, instead of sanctioning China, wants to sign an all-encompassing new nuclear pact with China; in effect, to reward them. 
The logic in all of this new policy, called constructive engagement, is that if we will engage China and we will trade with China and we will see economic expansion in China--and their economy is growing in double digits every year--that human rights conditions will improve, that the rights of the Chinese people will 
be enhanced. Such has not been the case. And if such a policy were one that we consistently enforced around the world, it would result in the lifting of sanctions on Cuba, the lifting of sanctions on North Korea, because if we believe that increased trade is going to bring the downfall of totalitarianism, it ought to work not only in China but North Korea and Cuba, too. But we hear no mention we ought to change our trade policies toward North Korea or Cuba; all the time saying if we just continue to trade with China, things will get better there. Now, in the midst of all of this, the administration admits to signing an all-encompassing nuclear pact with China. Lets look at the facts, because I think they speak for themselves. 
In December 1992, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979 with the transfer by the Ministry of Aerospace Industry of approximately 24 M-11 missiles to Pakistan. 
Let's look at the facts. From September 1994 to June 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China again violated the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1996, with the transfer by the Ministry of Aerospace Industry of as many as 30 M-11 ballistic missiles to Pakistan. 
In August 1996, the Government of the Peoples Republic of China again violated the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act of 1979, and the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992, with the transfer by the China Precision Engineering Institute to Iran's defense industries of gyroscopes, accelerometers, and test equipment for the construction and test of ballistic missile guidance systems. 
While looking at the facts, it was reported in August of this year that the United States Central Intelligence Agency discovered a shipment by the People's Republic of China to the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, a Syria Government agency that oversees missile development, of guidance equipment for M-11 ballistic missiles. This alleged system would be a violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime. This alleged shipment would have taken place after the limited sanctions imposed by the United States on China for shipments of M-11 missiles and components to Pakistan had been lifted following the assurances by China that it would comply with the Missile Technology Control Regime. 
So we see these ongoing violations. After each of these violations, and there are many more, our administration either failed to take appropriate actions to deter future violations of such acts, took the least onerous action against the Government of the People's Republic of China that was possible under such acts, or rescinded previous actions, thereby diluting or eliminating the deterrent effect of sanctions under such acts with respect to China. 
This inaction has forced three important results. First, this Congress renewed MFN to China. Second, we are now honoring the Communist leader in our country. Third, the public has been convinced that through such nearsighted ill-advised strategies like constructive engagement, China would change. 
Yes, Madam President, China has changed--for the worse. And this Congress and this President, I believe, has done too little. If you will, we have stood idly by. We have said too little. We have done virtually nothing. 
What is truly unprecedented is the administration's recent campaign to draw a bright and attractive picture of Communist China. I ask the President and I ask this Congress, and I have turned to this before and I will turn to it again, have you not read the 1996 United States State Department's China Country Report on Human Rights Practices? Because I have read it. The information in it is horrific. Once again, allow me to quote from this report:  
China has continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted norms stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the abuse of laws protecting basic freedoms. Abuses include torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and lengthy incommunicado detention. The government continued severe restrictions on freedom of speech, the press, assembly, religion, privacy and workers' rights. 
That's from our own State Department 1996 country report on China. 
In 1989 we watched with amazement as courageous Chinese students marched in Tiananmen Square. Today, they are all gone. They are all gone. During their struggle they defied the tanks, they looked to the United States for inspiration, they quoted our Declaration of Independence, they built replicas of our Statue of Liberty, and throughout it all United States policymakers have answered that economic engagement would stop China's abuses of human rights. As far as I can tell, not only are profit projections driving our foreign policy, not only is our current policy with China appeasement rather than engagement, not only does this Congress continue to turn a blind eye to the oppressed in the interests of trade opportunities, but, President Jiang Zemin's visit is a clear sign to the world, our enemies, and our friends that not only did the United States tacitly approve of everything that was going on, I think, from forced sterilization to the breaking of ballistic missile treaties, but even more important it's a clear message that we can and will tolerate anything and everything without repercussion and without a price. 
I am reminded of President Ronald Reagan. I think few have served our country more nobly. And I am reminded of my good friend Senator John Ashcroft who has spoken so forcefully on the issue of China, especially even during this last month. In President Ronald Reagan's second inaugural address, he spoke of the danger of simple-minded appeasement. He spoke of accommodating countries at their lowest and least. This is what former President Reagan said: 
History teaches us that wars begin when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap. 
There have been no repercussions to the egregious human rights abuses ongoing in China. There have been no repercussions. There has been no price to pay for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that the Government of China has carried out. There have been no repercussions for the incomprehensible toleration by the Chinese Government of laogai camps, the slave labor camps that exist in which there are hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, incarcerated. 
Madam President, President Jiang Zemin's visit proves that China believes that the price of aggression and the price of these abuses is cheap. It proves that we in this country accept this, and I can remember when we did not. It proves that, just as President Clinton stated last Friday that China is at a crossroads, well, Madam President, we in the United States are at a crossroads as well. President Jiang Zemin and his enjoyment of a state visit, a visit that has been elevated to the highest level, the red carpet treatment that he has been accorded, the 21-gun salute, I believe this is truly a slap in the face to every Chinese political dissident that languishes today in a Chinese prison. It is time that we as public policymakers, those concerned about the welfare of our fellow human beings wherever they may live in this world, who are the recipients by their creator, as we Americans are, of certain unchangeable, undeniable human rights, it is time that we, once again, not only spoke out, but move from debate and discussion and outrage to action. 
During the course of this state visit, while I disagree with much that has been planned and the royal treatment that he is being given, it is an opportunity for us as Americans to show President Zemin what freedom really is. It is an opportunity for us, through our protests, through our debates, through our congressional oversight hearings that are going on, through every means possible, to raise these most serious issues to the attention of President Zemin and to show him not only what free expression really is, but to show him the true intensity of the feeling of the American people, if not our Government, the American people at what has been tolerated and what continues to go on in China today. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to talk about an issue which literally means life and breath to 30 million Americans. It appears that in an effort to clean up the environment, some heavy-handed bureaucrats are willing to reduce the quality of life for those Americans--children, adults, and senior citizens--who are dependent upon inhalers like this inhaler that I have with me today. As I rode the elevator up to the Chamber, I mentioned to the elevator operator what I was going to be doing. She said, `Well, please do it because it means life to me. I have to have this to breathe.' 
I have a nephew, John Paul, who is an asthmatic, who has been dependent upon these inhalers that would be outlawed unless we act as the Senate. 
Because of this, I am offering the Asthma Inhaler Regulatory Relief Act, AIRR, which would block the Food and Drug Administration from banning certain metered dose inhalers, MDI's. I am glad today that Senator Shelby, Senator Bond, and Senator DeWine have all joined as original cosponsors on this legislation. Senator DeWine has a special interest in this, with four of his children, it is my understanding, being asthmatics and being dependent upon these inhalers. These inhalers are used by nearly 30 million Americans who suffer from respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis. These people have come to rely on their inhalers as a lifeline for daily living. Yet, the FDA at this time, in its very questionable wisdom, has decided that inhalers severely damage the environment and must be banned. One of only a few avenues to the outside world, the FDA would seal this avenue and ban these inhalers. 
The FDA initially published an advanced notice of a proposed rulemaking to eliminate the use of MDI's that use chlorofluorocarbons on March 6, 1997. About this time, I received several letters which initially sparked my interest in the issue. I have come to find out that the FDA, in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency, proposed this rule as part of the EPA's desire to eliminate all uses of chlorofluorocarbons as soon as possible. Most metered dose inhalers use CFC's as the propellant to deliver the medicine from the inhaler to the lungs of the patient. Under the 1987 Montreal protocol CFC's are to be phased out globally by the year 2005. However, certain uses of CFC's, including this inhaler, were explicitly recognized by signatories of the protocol as vital to human health while posing relatively little harm to the environment. This exception has allowed the continued manufacture and use of inhalers which use CFC's as their propellants. 
This exception, however, is being threatened by the Food and Drug Administration despite the objections of many, including the American Academy of Family Physicians. In their May 5, 1997 letter to Michael Friedman, Deputy Commissioner of the FDA, the physicians wrote:  
The Academy believes that the proposed rule might negatively affect our patients' health care and urges the FDA to continue to deem MDI's as `essential' under the Montreal Protocol. 
These are the doctors who deal with our children day in and day out. They reiterated twice in their letter that they support eliminating CFC's from the environment but feel that this shortened timetable is not necessary and may be detrimental, very detrimental to their patients' health. 
Carol Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has come to the Congress on numerous occasions to lobby on behalf of EPA's proposed clean air standards. I serve on the clean air subcommittee. We have had Administrator Browner before us numerous times as an advocate for children. One of the most compelling arguments she has made on behalf of these new air standards is that she is saving the children and the elderly from unnecessary respiratory illness. I respect Ms. Browner for her zeal to protect children and the elderly, but I find it ironic and amazing and I have to wonder how she can support taking the medication away from those whom she claims to be trying to protect. 
I wonder how she can look these children in the eye and tell them she is taking away the one thing that allows them to play outside and enjoy the high-energy activities of running, climbing and participating in sports. Ms. Browner's actions will literally rob them of their childhood and force them to sit on the sidelines. Of course, the EPA has an answer. First, the EPA and the FDA will tell us there are other MDI's available that will provide the necessary protection for these children. The truth is there is only one that is currently available. Many are in the research and development stages, but that pales in comparison to the hundreds of these inhalers that are available currently. 
Doctors will tell you that different patients react differently to different medications. There are many inhalers that are virtually identical in composition yet have dramatically different effects on various patients. Again, quoting the American Academy of Family Physicians: 
We are concerned that the proposed rule will severely limit the number of therapies available to our patients. We know that a drug that works for one patient may not work for another. We would like our members to have the flexibility to try different therapies to find the one that is most effective for their patients. 
Simply put, 1 inhaler is not enough and 10 is not enough. Doctors must have the ability to choose the medication that best suits their patients. In the case of respiratory treatment, one size definitely does not fit all. 
Another concern I have with allowing one inhaler to dominate the market is the cost to the consumer. Obviously, where there are hundreds as currently exist, including many generic brands, there will be lower prices for the consumer. If we allow the FDA and the EPA to ban CFC inhalers, many may not be able to afford the treatment. The majority of patients who suffer from these symptoms live in the inner-city where the cost of living is very high and their income very low. These families rely on inhalers which can cost eight times less than newer name brand products without CFC's. If these children from low-income inner-city families lose the most accessible inhaler, they are less likely to continue adequate treatment which is so important to a normal life. 
According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology has told both the FDA and the EPA that because of these increased costs, their proposal will unfairly punish poor children and the elderly who have the highest risks of asthma-related sickness and death. 
A certain consequence of a decrease in the use of inhalers as part of a schedule to keep asthma in control is an increase in hospital admissions and an increase in deaths. According to a panel of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, between 1980 and 1993 failure to comply with treatment explains a 300 percent increase in asthma-related deaths among children. This proposal put forth by the EPA and the FDA will increase costs and can only worsen this statistic. 
Another common argument the EPA will use is that by banning CFC's, we are making the air more safe for children and the elderly. While certainly there are studies that show these gases are harmful and increase the probability that an asthmatic will have an attack, if you look at the statistics, you will find that inhalers, such as this one, account for at most 1.5 percent of all CFC's produced in the world. The EPA supports taking away nearly 30 million people's inhalers to eliminate approximately 1.5 percent of the CFC's produced. That hardly seems like a logical target for reducing CFC's and preserving and maintaining the health of the American people. 
In the October edition of Insight Magazine, Robert Goldbert, senior research fellow at George Washington Center For Neuroscience, determines that banning MDI's that only account for 1.5 percent of CFC emissions is another cynical exploitation of kids for the sake of environmental correctness. 
I do not believe that this proposal is part of a strategy to save the ozone layer. I believe it is a strategy to use children as a political tool for an end that I frankly do not understand. We cannot allow the FDA and the EPA to require children and senior citizens to foot the bill for reductions in CFC's that will do no good, while hurting the most vulnerable. 
These actions, if allowed to proceed, will literally rob these children of their childhood and significantly reduce the quality of life of all those dependent on inhalers. 
I urge the Presiding Officer and all of my colleagues who may be listening today to join in cosponsorship of what I think is commonsense legislation and that is going to be to the benefit of 30 million Americans including children and the elderly and those who are most vulnerable in our society.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for yielding time. 
Yesterday I voted to invoke cloture on the McCain-Feingold bill. Today I will oppose that effort. 
I voted for cloture because I want campaign finance reform. I want an opportunity to amend McCain-Feingold, which I believe is a seriously flawed bill. I want a chance to vote on a reform bill and I want to ban or limit soft money. But it is now clear that there is no consensus in support of McCain-Feingold, and if we are to have serious and meaningful reform, we will and must take a different direction. 
I absolutely do not support the current version of McCain-Feingold. In my opinion, and I have expressed it both publicly and privately, McCain-Feingold contains provisions that threaten free speech and pose serious constitutional problems, especially in the area of issue advocacy. These groups, which play such an important part in the political process, regardless of their affiliation, deserve to play that important role. And we must not in any way place a chill on their right of free expression and their ability to criticize their public officials. There have been abuses, no doubt about that. But it is far better for us to err on the side of freedom and to err on the side of liberty and to err on the side of the Constitution than to take a chance of passing a misguided, though popular right now, reform bill that would in fact begin that erosion of those liberties and freedoms and the right of free expression that we cherish as Americans and that we always should. 
It is clear there is no consensus on McCain-Feingold and will not be. It is equally clear that repeated cloture votes on McCain-Feingold is a part of a political strategy to portray opponents of McCain-Feingold as opponents of reform. As unfortunate as it is for the American people, the McCain-Feingold bill has become so politicized that even supporters of campaign finance reform, like myself, are disgusted with the political tactics that have been used in this debate. You have to question the sincerity of a strategy that disrupts Senate business and distracts the Senate from other important business such as ISTEA, the transportation funding bill, fast track, appropriation conference reports and judicial nominations, all of these vitally important things, pressing business of the American people, and to set that aside so we can hold press conferences to portray opponents of McCain-Feingold as opponents of reform, which is not true and is not fair. 
If supporters of McCain-Feingold truly wanted to put forth a serious effort to enact reform, they would take a different approach by working to find consensus, by working to find agreement, rather than attempting to score political points. 
I will not be a part of these partisan guerrilla warfare tactics. I fully and completely support campaign finance reform. I think we have need to address it. I think we need to reform the system and particularly deal with that area in which there has been abuse, in the area of soft money. But I will not again vote to invoke cloture on S. 25 and be a part of a political game that is more concerned about portraying political opponents in a certain bad light than enacting meaningful and real and significant reform. 
I thank again the Senator from Kentucky for his leadership and for his genuine deep convictions in defense of the first amendment and the right of free expression. I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in the strongest support of the District of Columbia student opportunity scholarship amendment offered by Senators Coats and Lieberman to the D.C. appropriations bill. I have long been convinced of the value of school choice programs. I think the debate this afternoon has been very healthy for our country. 
Earlier this year, the Washington Post ran a five-part series on the D.C. schools, detailing the mounting problems of the physical deterioration of its school buildings, violence in the classrooms, and the falling academic success among students. Eighty-five percent of D.C. public school students who go on to college at the University of the District of Columbia [UDC] need 2 years of remedial education before beginning course work toward a degree at all. While this statistic is alarming and should not be tolerated, it is a prime example of how the D.C. public schools are failing the very children that they are supposed to be serving. It is the children who are the losers. 
Some argue, as my colleague just argued, that if only more money were available to mend the crumbling school buildings, or to better train the teachers or to hire more teachers, then everything would be fine. Mr. President, more money is not really the answer. Despite spending more than $7,300 per student in 1996, which is among the Nation's highest spending rates, 65 percent of all D.C. public schoolchildren, two-thirds of them, test below their grade levels; 72 percent of fourth graders in the D.C. public schools tested below basic proficiency on the NAEP test--worse than any other school system in the Nation. 
More money is not the answer. What about the increased violence? The National Education Goals Panel reported last year that both students and teachers in D.C. schools are subjected to levels of violence that are twice the national average. 
So I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, isn't this bill the perfect place to give us the opportunity to show what vouchers can do? They do help real families. Some of my staff members are privileged to work with one D.C. family who was fortunate to have received $4,000 of scholarship money this fall to enroll six of their children in Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic School here in the District of Columbia. I had the honor of meeting one of those children, Shannon, when she visited my office in the spring to interview me as part of a school project on Arkansas. It was little Shannon who, 1 year ago, told her tutor that she wanted to go to a Catholic school. When asked why, she emphatically answered, `because I want to learn much.' 
Mr. President, even though Shannon had never been to a Catholic school, nor did she know anybody enrolled in a Catholic school, she knew that if she went to a Catholic school, she would learn. She wanted to learn much. Shannon's mother knew that, for her children to progress in their studies and graduate from high school, she desperately needed to get them out of the failing D.C. schools and into a place where the teachers would spend time with her children and teach them. 
Under this amendment, nearly 2,000 of the District of Columbia's poorest children--not the wealthy kids, those from the rich side of town whose parents can afford to send them to elite schools--but the poorest children would receive scholarships for tuition costs at a private school in the District of Columbia, or in adjacent counties in Maryland and Virginia. Mothers like Shannon's are eyewitnesses to their children's improvement when their children are enrolled in a safe, stable, and thriving school environment. 
The Coats-Lieberman plan is a lifeline of hope for thousands of D.C. parents, like Shannon's mom, who have waited and are still waiting for an opportunity to give their children a solid education 
and a chance to succeed. 
This amendment makes so much common sense. The question is, will vouchers work? Let's give vouchers a chance right here in one of the worst school districts in the Nation. Let's not continue to put good money after bad by simply pouring it into a system that is broken. Let's give the children of this city hope. Let's give the parents of the poorest children in this city an opportunity to give their children the best educational opportunity. 
I commend the Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, and Senator Lieberman for their leadership and for the opportunity to conduct this debate and to cast this important vote. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. As the sponsor of the amendment that became section 809 of S. 830, I concur with the distinguished ranking minority member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee that this legislation would ensure patient access to individualized drug therapy, and prevent unnecessary FDA regulation of health professional practice. This legislation would exempt pharmacy compounding from several regulatory requirements but would not exempt drug manufacturing from the act's requirements. The legislation also sets forth a number of conditions that would have to be met in order to qualify for the exemption from the act's requirements. I would note that the conditions established by section 809 should be used by the State boards of pharmacy and medicine for proper regulation of pharmacy compounding in addition to State-specific regulations. When a State board determines that certain compounding activities are outside the parameters established in section 809, that State board should refer the practitioners in question to the FDA for review.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment that I think supports one of our most fundamental rights, the right of property ownership. The fundamental right, I believe, is at least eroded, threatened, by the Executive order signed by the President on September 11. I am sure it is a well-intended Executive order, designating the American heritage rivers initiative. The initiative is intended, in the words of the President in his Executive order `to help communities protect their river resources in a way that integrates natural resource protection, economic development and the preservation of historic and cultural values, things that we all support.' 
The difficulty is that we have an Executive order that, originating from the executive branch, has not gone through the committee process. It has not received any congressional authorization, has not received any appropriation, but simply is something that has been ordered by the President. The funding for this initiative comes from eight Cabinet departments including the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Interior, and the Department of Energy. In addition to all of the Cabinet departments, there is funding from a number of agencies as well: EPA, NEA, NEH, and the Advisory Council of Historic Preservation. 
The end result is funding from various departments and agencies apart from any congressional hearings, and apart from any congressional authorization or appropriation. 
I support riverfront revitalization but not at the expense of trampling upon basic property rights and subverting plans and desires of local communities. I think riverfront revitalization should be community-led and a community-driven process, not something that is dictated through an Executive order in Washington. 
My amendment allows for the riverfront renaissance that communities desperately need, while offering protections from further Federal encroachment. It allows the President's Executive order to go forward and it would allow the rivers initiative to go forward. 
Congress has never authorized or appropriated one dime for the American heritage rivers initiative, nor has it even defined the term `river community.' The Executive order contains the term `river community' without any kind of definition. This amendment would require congressional review of the 10 rivers that have been nominated for designation. The Executive order lays out 10 rivers to be designated as American heritage rivers. We would simply say that when those 10 rivers are designated, that Congress should have the right of review and designation, confirmation of those designated rivers. 
The amendment would require that all property owners holding title to lands directly abutting the riverbank shall be consulted and asked for letters of support or opposition to the designation. 
Now, it has been wrongly conveyed by the opposition of this amendment that somehow every property owner along the river would have veto power and that if any property owner objected to the designation or objected to participation in the heritage rivers initiative, that suddenly the whole project would therefore be ended, or any possibility of receiving that designation would be eliminated. That is not the case at all. We simply believe that those most involved, those whose lives are going to be most affected, the property owners along the river, would have the right to say yes or no. I think that makes perfect sense and that process is not guaranteed under the Executive order. 
Let's ensure that they are notified and at least that they have the right of commenting and expressing their opinion. 
In the amendment, we would define the river community as those who own property, reside, or who regularly conduct business within 10 miles of the river considered for designation. It is absolutely necessary for us to place a definition as to what a river community is, and how it should be defined. 
The amendment would make the initiative subject to the existing provisions of the Clean Water and Safety Drinking Water Acts. I hope that would be supported by environmentalists. All of us are concerned about the enforcement of environmental laws, and an Executive order that will somehow be able to circumvent existing environmental law. The amendment would ensure that this process, as it goes forward, would be subject to existing provisions of the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
I agree we must revitalize our rivers and preserve their historic character. This amendment ensures that it is not at the expense of those who have chosen to be a part of the surrounding communities. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. We need to define river community, we need to comply with existing environmental laws, and the Clean Water Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. We need to ensure that property owners are notified that they have the right of comment, that they have the right to write letters of opposition or support. 
We need to provide in this Executive order for congressional review. If there is one complaint I have heard from my constituents across the State of Arkansas, it is that, we as the elected representatives of the people, too often have simply given up our legislative authority. We have allowed the executive branch, through various Executive orders, to usurp what is legitimately and constitutionally our right and our responsibility. This amendment represents one small area where we can say that the President has issued an Executive order, and we now will ensure that we have the right of review. This amendment would do that. 
I think that we can once again assert our proper role by ensuring that we can review the designation of the heritage rivers. Most importantly, we would protect property owners from the encroachment of an ever-growing Government and an ever more intrusive bureaucracy. We would ensure that the plans of the local communities are not subverted because of this new Executive order and that local communities, drive the entire process. I believe the amendment is reasonable, it is temperate, and it will reassure our citizens, our constituents, and those along these important American heritage rivers, that we take their rights as property owners and citizens of this country and value them greatly. 
I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I yield the floor.  
Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I am going to do something that I think is highly irregular. I earlier asked unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. But after reading the letter that came from the Sierra Club, and a number the other organizations, and after listening to the comments of my esteemed colleague, and my good friend, Senator Dodd, I really think that it is essential that the amendment be read. 
So I am going to proceed to do that. It is very brief. But I think the American people, whenever my colleague says there is some great morass, that we are adding some great regulatory burden--there are some I guess that would say democracy is a great regulatory burden; to ask people to have some input on whether or not as property owners they want to be part of this, that it is a terrible burden, I guess; but that it is a big process to ask Congress to use its proper role in review. I mean, when we look at wild and scenic rivers, we review that. We have the right to make a determination on that. 
I would like to read the amendment. I think we can perhaps better focus our debate when we understand exactly what is in the amendment.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I find myself in the uncomfortable position of offering an amendment that is opposed by a chairman for whom I have the greatest respect and greatest esteem and the highest regard. So it is with that recognition that were I not so convinced of the merits of this amendment, I would have to rethink its value and its submission. 
When we talk about making a mountain out of a molehill, I think the opponents of this amendment are making a mountain out of a molehill. This amendment has the simple purpose of protecting the rights of property owners and ensuring the input and participation of those most affected by these designations. It is not too much to think that Congress ought to ratify this designation, that Congress ought to have a say or view in the designation of these rivers in what could be a very, very broad program--eight cabinet departments, and four Federal agencies We have a process for the Wild and Scenic Rivers. Why not have a say in the American heritage rivers initiative as well. 
Now, my esteemed colleague said there is very little money involved. We do not know. It has not been authorized, nor has it been appropriated. How much money is involved in this? Who can really give me an answer to that? There is no answer because we have eight cabinet departments and we have four Federal agencies, each one taking a little bit out of their pot. How much is involved? I would pose that question to those who are opposing this amendment. This has been presented as just a small initiative; that really we are making too much out of it and this is just a voluntary program. If it is a small program, we have eight cabinet-level departments involved and four Federal agencies participating in it. That sounds like a rather major initiative to me. 
If you will compare the simplicity of my three-page amendment to the length of the Executive order, which has been submitted for the Record, I think one will see who is making a mountain out of what molehill. 
Now, my esteemed colleague gave us some historical background as to how this initiative came forward. Let me just amplify a little bit more. The President officially announced this in his State of the Union Address. It was published during the month of February in the Federal Register, although it was not noticed to a great extent. Several public hearings apparently were held in the spring but congressional offices were not uniformly notified of hearing dates. Equally troubling was the short 3-week public comment period that was posted in the May 19 Federal Register. Because of the scope and the goals of the initiative and the magnitude of possible designations, I along with 15 of my colleagues signed a letter to Kathleen McGinty, chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, asking for a 120-day extension. 
That is all we asked for, extend the comment period. They gave 3 weeks for the public. This is being presented as, Well, we would welcome all of those who are concerned about this to have adequate input. The fact is, the administration gave 3 weeks for public comment, and we as the elected representatives of the people said, Please extend that to 120 days. The administration only agreed to a mere 3 weeks. I think that was a very inadequate response to a program that has never been authorized and never been appropriated. 
As I read the letter that has been sent out to all of my colleagues from the American Rivers, from the National Audubon Society, National Trust for Historic Preservation, the River Network, and the Sierra Club, I hardly recognized the amendment of which they were speaking. They outlined their objections to the Hutchinson amendment. They say the Hutchinson amendment imposes `unprecedented, onerous and unnecessary requirements.' 
I read the amendment. So let the American people make their judgment as to whether that is an appropriate characterization of the amendment and whether asking Congress to approve, asking the property owners be notified and given the opportunity to say yes or no to it, whether they like it or not, if that is an onerous and unprecedented requirement. 
Then they have four bullets in which they express their objections. Listen to these objections. These are the objections of the American Rivers, National Trust for Historic Preservation, Sierra Club, the National Audubon Society, and the River Network. Objection No. 1, `All designations would require congressional approval.' Boy, that is something to object to, that Congress would actually approve it. They object, `The amendment would require all property owners along rivers to be identified and asked to support or oppose the nomination.' Boy, that is something to object to, to actually notify the property owners and give them an opportunity to say whether they support it or oppose it. This is the objection of these groups to this amendment. That is an onerous requirement, to notify property owners about this new designation that is going to impact their lives, impact their property, the use of their property. They object, they say, `The amendment would prohibit the initiative to assist nondesignated rivers.' I don't see that in the amendment. 
Then they say, `The amendment would create and impose on river communities a 20-mile-wide Federal corridor including all persons who own property, reside or regularly conduct business in the corridor.' I say to my distinguished colleague who questioned the definition, if you don't like definition, give us a different definition. But at least there is a definition of what a river community is. Because in the Executive order there is no definition of what we are talking about when we say a river community. We thought there ought to be some kind of definition as to what a river community is, and the best way to define it is to designate those who are most impacted by it. 
So, once again, I would never present any legislative offering that I am authoring as being a perfect legislative remedy. But I am suggesting that there is nothing intemperate or unreasonable about what we are seeking. We are seeking to ensure that private property rights are protected, that property owners have an opportunity for input, and that congressional review and approval be preserved. That is our prerogative as those elected by our citizens. 
Once again, if there is a mountain being made out of a molehill, it is those who would oppose a very commonsense amendment that would ensure that those most impacted by another Federal initiative will have input and have some protection for their rights and that those they elected to represent them up here would have a final say on whether those rivers are so designated or not. I ask my colleagues to look beyond the rhetoric and look at the reality of what this amendment does, the purpose of the amendment, and then grant their support for the amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, with mutual respect for Senator Dodd's opposition to this amendment, three times my distinguished colleague has suggested that a vote for the Hutchinson amendment will be a vote not to participate in the American heritage rivers initiative. I assure my colleagues, and I hope that Senator Dodd will join me in assuring my colleagues, that this process is not so political that casting a vote for an amendment designed to protect the private property owners would somehow jeopardize later approval or selection as an American heritage river. It is simply not the case.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Reclaiming my time, that, of course, is the case, but a vote for the Hutchinson amendment is not, as it has been suggested, a vote against this initiative or a vote against having a river in your State participate in this program. 
I think it gives the wrong appearance and the wrong suggestion for Members of the Senate that somehow their vote on this amendment might influence whether or not rivers in their States would be selected and be so designated. 
There are many who came and asked me to sponsor an amendment 
similar to what was passed in the House in which funds were simply cut off for this program. I resisted the desire to do that, because I didn't think that the goals, as stated for the initiative, were bad, but I did believe that there needed to be some protections, and some assurances. 
Senator Dodd says that this is somehow some backdoor way of killing the program. Well, the House in effect did that. I resisted that because I didn't want to indicate I wasn't supportive of the goals of the initiative. But I did believe that we needed to have a process that ensured that it would guarantee the rights of private property owners along these precious historic rivers would be protected. 
It has been asserted that we have such a process in place. My confidence in that process is somewhat shaken because of my experience with the administration over this issue. 
Fifteen U.S. Senators signed a letter asking for the comment period to be extended for 120 days, but we could not get the administration to honor that request. Because our simple request was denied, I have a hard time accepting that the requests of average citizens would be honored. 
The process may look good on paper, but that is not the process in reality. If, in fact, there is such confidence that property owners are going to have input and those most affected are going to have adequate input, then there shouldn't be any problem in accepting an amendment that puts that assurance into statutory language. 
The fact is, the process has been short-circuited. Those most impacted and those most affected are not being given an opportunity to express themselves. 
It has been suggested that this is a small program, voluntary program, no money involved. How can that be asserted? We don't know how much money is going to be spent. Nobody can tell me how much is going to be spent on this initiative because no one knows. There has been no authorization. There has been no appropriation. We have eight Cabinet-level departments involved and four Federal agencies involved. Let's put that in the amendment, `No money will be spent. We are going to designate these rivers and no money will be spent.' No. We are not going to get that assurance because that is not the case. 
How broad are the implications of this initiative? No one knows, because Congress has been cut out of the process, until this moment. An Executive order, a short comment period, the process moves forward, and when one Senator dares to stand along with some colleagues who have had some courage to cosponsor the amendment, suddenly we are imposing some terrible, onerous burden upon this program. Who objects to that? I believe this is why we were elected: to look at the executive branch, to rein in agencies that may go off without adequate public input and without a proper process. All we are doing in this amendment is assuring there is going to be such a process. 
They say, `Well, this is terrible to have to notify all the property owners.' There are a lot of ways of notifying, and we have, both on the State and Federal level. There are many different kinds of public notification. You can do that through newspapers. You can do that through radio. You can do that through public service announcements. As a former radio station owner, it was something we did that all the time. It is common knowledge that newspapers give public notice all the time. 
It is important to ensure in statute that we are going to have public notice to all property owners and that their input is desired. We want to know if you are for the initiative or against it, give us your ideas. Give us your suggestions--that is not some kind of onerous burden. It is a fundamental part of freedom. It is part of liberty. It is part of the essence of a democratic republic. It is an asssurance to the citizens of our country that they will have adequate input. It is not to stand here on the floor of the U.S. Senate and say, `Well, we can't possibly notify 
everybody.' We can and we should. The Amerian public should know, and they have the right to give their thoughts and their suggestions on whether they are for it or they are against it. 
If one is convinced that the property owners' input is going to be guaranteed under the current process, there surely should be no objection to supporting this amendment and guaranteeing that they are going to have proper input. The fact is, we need to reassure the citizens of this country that we in the U.S. Senate do take the rights of property owners seriously and that when we are going to designate their property, we are going to give it a title--we don't know what all the implications of the American Heritage Rivers Initiative may be--it is incumbent upon us to guarantee that they are going to have the right to be involved in that process. That is what this amendment is about. Let's let them know. Let's let them have input. Let's let their elected officials be able to make the final decision. 
It is argued that for Congress to review and to approve the designations of these rivers is somehow to politicize the process. Anybody who has watched the executive branch operate over the last 4 years--for that matter, I suspect you go could go back much further; I have been in Congress since 1993--if you look back over those years, I think it is very difficult to argue that designations and decisions being made in the executive branch are somehow nonpolitical. 
If you wanted to depoliticize the process, bring it before the U.S. Senate, bring it before the House, bring it before the appropriate committees and let us ratify it. We do it all the time. We do it for the wild and scenic rivers. This will allow Congress to have the same kind of input and the same kind of ratification process that we have on other programs. 
No, that is not a bad thing; it is a good thing. It is a good thing to notify property owners, to ensure public input, to allow the elected representatives of the people to have a say-so in these kinds of programs. For many of us who have looked at the use of the Executive order over the last few years, we understand, we understand well, that a nation that was built upon three equal branches of Government and a system of checks and balances. Too often the legislative branch has allowed our prerogatives to be usurped by an executive branch that would just as soon govern by Executive order. Whether it is totally meritorious or whether it may not be totally meritorious, we should have a say in those kinds of decisions. Here is an area in which we, as the legislative branch, can reassert our rightful constitutional authority to review these decisions. 
So I ask my colleagues to, once again, look at the actual language of the amendment, look at the intent of the amendment, look beyond the rhetoric and support this very responsible, moderate, temperate provision to ensure that the rights of our citizens are protected. I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I think it has been a good debate. I think some of the suggestions made and some of the points are very valid. We have tried to respond to those. 
I want to assure my distinguished colleague from New York that I believe the Hudson River's possibilities and its chances of being designated as an American Heritage will be enhanced by the adoption of this amendment. One of the provisions is prioritization, which would be in accord with the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. That will help the Hudson River. We don't designate the rivers in Congress. Congress doesn't designate them, but we would like to have the right of approval. I think that is proper and appropriate. 
The amendment does not undermine the Clinton Executive order. Instead, it assures that the rights of property owners will be upheld through the notification and comment process. It further assures that the true interests of those residing near, owning property, or conducting business in the area of the river will be heard, and that their interests will not be muted by powerful outside lobbyists or interest groups who desire to force their will on a selected community. 
It should be understood that this initiative has never been authorized, money has never been appropriated. It sweeps money from eight Cabinet departments, four governmental agencies, allowing the Federal bureaucracy to dominate what should be a community-directed initiative. 
My friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, made the analogy of the Scenic Highways Program in the State of Arkansas, in which highways are called scenic highways, and signs are put up, and how that helps tourism. I remind my good friend that the scenic highways in Arkansas are approved by the State legislature. So I think if we are going to carry that analogy, Congress should assert itself in its proper role in approving these designations. That is what it is all about. 
We don't know the cost of this initiative, the magnitude of it. Congress needs to be involved in it. We want congressional approval. Executive orders are being overutilized by this administration. Congress needs to reassert itself as an equal branch of Government. We want the property owners to be protected. I have shown my good faith in trying to make that workable. It is a workable amendment. We want those rivers to be prioritized in compliance with existing law, the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. It is a good amendment, it is a simple amendment, in contrast with the lengthy Executive order the President has issued. 
This is a very simple amendment that provides very basic protections and ensures congressional input on these decisions in this program that will be made. I will close with this. I ask my colleagues this question: If you owned property along one of these rivers, wouldn't you want to be consulted? I think the answer to that is `yes,' and if the answer to that question is `yes,' then you need to vote against this motion to table and support the Hutchinson amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to engage Senator Gorton in a discussion of the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program. As the Senator is aware, the House of Representatives, by a vote of 222 to 203, on July 15, 1997 passed the appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior. Included as part of that legislation was an amendment which prohibits funding for the U.S. Man and Biosphere Program. Although a similar provision has not been included as part of the Senate deliberations on this appropriation, I offer the following argument for its inclusion in the upcoming conference between the House and Senate. 
Many of my colleagues may question exactly what the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program is. After all you will not find it mentioned in any line item within this bill, nor will you find it housed in any of the agencies which receive appropriations under this bill. The U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program or USMAB operates through the State Department and under the guidance of the United Nations Educational and Scientific Organization [UNESCO] to designate tracts of American land as biosphere reserves. These areas are `voluntarily' subject to land management requirements designated to facilitate ecological research and preservation. Currently, there are 47 biospheres in the United States covering a land area approximately the size of Colorado, our eighth largest state. Some biospheres, such as the Land Between the Lakes Biosphere in Kentucky, include populated areas with over 484,000 residents. 
Despite the size and breadth of this program it has never been authorized by Congress, yet it is still 100% taxpayer funded. It is supported through interagency transfers from a total of thirteen different agencies. Collectively, these agencies contributed $210,000 to the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program in Fiscal Year 1997. 
While the total value associated with this program may fly well below many of our radar screens, the question and problems associated with the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program are very real and very much in the minds of our constituents. 
While I was serving in the House, some of my constituents brought to my attention a proposal by the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program to create the Ozark Man and the Biosphere Cooperative, which would have encompassed part of my home state of Arkansas as well as part of the states of Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. As I began to investigate this proposal some of the very worst fears of my constituents were confirmed. The `voluntary, honorary' land designation represented a potential threat to the private property rights of my constituents. For example, on page 120 of the Feasibility Study for the Ozark Man and the Biosphere appeared the following statement, `Normally, there is no need for change in land-holding or regulation following the designation of a biosphere reserve except where changes are required to ensure the strict protection of the core area or specific research sites.' 
Perhaps what was even more frightening was this biosphere was being created in secret. The 
steering committee responsible for attempting to create the Ozark biosphere admitted in their feasibility study that they `decided that public meetings would not be part of the interview process because such meetings tend to polarize views of the public and may capture negative attention from the press.' (Page 43 of the Feasibility study) 
Many individuals will undoubtedly wonder how this was possible. Under what legislative authority did the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program undertake these initiatives? The answer is that there is no legislative authority. Congress has never passed any law creating the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program authorizing them to engage in their activities. Even the web page for the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program admits that `No specific law exists for the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program.' 
Proponents of this program will undoubtedly assert that my experience was an isolated incident, and it was for the very reasons I cited that the area around the Ozarks was never finally designated a Biosphere Reserve. However, I would urge these individuals to look at the testimony presented before the House Resources Committee this year, where local officials repeatedly testified that they were never consulted about proposals to create biosphere reserves in their areas. I would encourage the proponents of this program to look to the Alaska and Colorado State Legislatures and the Kentucky State Senate, all of which passed resolutions opposing the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program, despite the fact that there are currently three biospheres in Alaska, four in Colorado, and two in Kentucky. To date, the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program has taken no action to address the concerns of these State and local officials. 
This is not to say that the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program has not produced some positive contributions to our understanding of the environment and mans relationship to it. However, until my questions, the questions, of my constituents, the questions of the State Legislatures, and the questions of many of our colleagues are answered, I in good conscience cannot support using one more tax dollar in support of this program. 
It is for these above stated reasons that I ask that the House adopted language be included in the Conference report. 
I thank Senator Gorton, for the opportunity to present this very important issue for Conference consideration.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Bryan amendment. I rise because this program has proven very successful over the years that it has been in existence. This is a positive program that promotes cooperation between public and private enterprises, which are the types of agreements we should be supporting on the Senate floor and not opposing. 
In addition, this program has been found that it costs the government no money. Price-Waterhouse did an economic analysis and determined that `the Forest Roads program does not contain a subsidy for timber purchasers.' This program is an efficient and effective mechanism for financing forest road construction. And, since net payments to the Treasury will remain the same, Price-Waterhouse concluded there is no subsidy to the timber purchaser. 
Finally, I want to stress a point that I feel is of utmost importance. Many do not realize that 25 percent of the proceeds from timber sales go directly to the counties to be used for roads and schools. In Arkansas, where the per capita expenditures on students rank 46 out of 51 states and the District of Columbia, our children cannot afford to lose this vital source of funding. 
Mr. President, I want to reiterate my strong opposition to this amendment to strike funding for the Forest Roads Program.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, and I thank the Senator from Michigan for yielding. 
Madam President, I commend the Senator from Michigan for his outstanding leadership on the issue of the National Endowment for the Arts, for his very constructive role that he has played over recent years since his entry in the Senate. I know this is an issue he has felt very strongly about, that he has looked for creative and innovative ways in which we can continue to fund arts in this country, in which we can continue to emphasize that arts are a priority and, at the same time, address many of the concerns that the American people have addressed concerning the National Endowment for the Arts, its administration and its elitist attitude. 
I would just like to say in reference to that attitude, which has caused such consternation among those who sincerely believe that arts are important in America but are greatly troubled by what they see in the National Endowment for the Arts, a statement that was made by Jane Alexander, the Chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, when she testified before the Labor and Human Resources Committee this past April. 
In a dialog with myself and in response to the questions I posed to her, Ms. Alexander said: 
Let me suggest an analogy here with regard to the arts. 
Her response was in direct answer to my question concerning the situation in Arkansas in which, out of 12 grant applications, only one was granted. A little over $400,000 went to the whole State of Arkansas, while single exhibits around this country received more. In response to that she said: 
Let me suggest an analogy here with regard to the arts . . . There are apples grown in practically every State of the United States, but there are few States that have the right conditions for nurturing and developing apple trees; and then, they are distributed all throughout the Nation. 
The implication being that arts are like apples, that there are only a few places they are really going to flourish, and that Arkansas was not one of them. I hope my constituents understand and I hope that my colleagues understand why that was so offensive to me. She went on: 
The same is true of the arts. The talent pools, the areas of nurturing and development of artists tend to be located in a few States. 
Perhaps that explains why one-third of all of the direct grants of the National Endowment go to six cities. Perhaps this attitude, revealed in an unguarded moment, explains why one-third of the congressional districts in this country receive nothing from the National Endowment for the Arts. This is an agency whose original mission was to broaden access to the arts. Broaden access to the arts--I ask, is that going to be the result of the attitude that development of artists tend to be located in a few States, that the talent pool is only located in a few States? I take great, great exception to that, and that is why I believe the Senator from Michigan--I have my own amendment I will be talking on later--but I commend the Senator from Michigan for the good job he has done in addressing these kind of abuses and this kind of attitude. 
I have pointed out that the administrative costs for the National Endowment are well above most other Federal agencies--almost 20 percent. Almost a penny out of every nickel that the NEA has is spent on administration overhead. 
So I believe the votes that we are going to cast this evening on the Abraham amendment, on the Hutchinson-Sessions amendment, and on the Hutchison of Texas amendment will be, to a great extent, a vote on whether we want the Washington bureaucracy or whether we want more local control on funding for the arts. 
So I ask support for the Abraham amendment. I also ask support for other amendments that will be offered concerning the National Endowment. We must not obfuscate, we must not confuse what this issue is. It is not are you proarts or against arts. So often I have heard proponents of the NEA come down and say, `Well, arts are good.' Of course, arts are good. They are beneficial, uplifting and they are inspiring and ennobling. They are all of those things, but you cannot equate the NEA with arts. In fact, the NEA funds less than 5 percent of the Federal contribution to arts in this country. So it is time that we reform. It is time we made a change in the status quo. 
I commend the Senator from Michigan. I thank him for yielding.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, over and over during the debate on the National Endowment for the Arts we have heard the proponents come to the floor and say how good and beneficial the arts are. Who can argue with that? The argument they seem to make is, we ought to automatically reauthorize, that we ought to automatically appropriate $100 million for the National Endowment for the Arts because art is good, without any scrutiny, without any close examination of how the National Endowment is operating, how they are working today. 
The debate has in fact deteriorated into kind of a syllogism. The syllogism goes like this: Art is good. The National Endowment for the Arts is art; and, therefore, the NEA is good. 
Obviously, art is good. It is inspiring. It is uplifting. We have heard anecdote after anecdote of the benefits of art in our lives. But the NEA is not the equivalent of art. 
In fact, as we see on this chart, the NEA is less than 5 percent of the total Federal support for the arts and the humanities. You can look at the Smithsonian, the military bands, the Fulbright International Exchange, the National Endowment of the Humanities, the National Gallery of Art, the Holocaust Memorial Council. On and on we find the Federal role in arts is not limited to the National Endowment at all. 
Only 5 percent, in fact, of all of the Federal involvement, involves the NEA. That 5 percent though, as we have seen, has been eroded by extravagant overhead, over 18 percent administrative costs that are immediately taken off because of the bureaucracy here in Washington. And that small 5 percent is absorbed by six cities--six cities. And one-third of all of the congressional districts in the United States receive nothing from the National Endowment of the Arts. 
So in all of this debate, the problems in the NEA have gone unanswered. I heard the proponents of the NEA come to the floor, and over and over again they laud how wonderful art is--Who can object to that?--how great literature is. Who can complain about that? But they never respond to the objections that have been raised concerning the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Their mission is broader public access to the arts. Yet, as we saw just a few moments ago in a statement by Chairwoman Jane Alexander, she says that there are only a few States that have the proper nurturing and development to produce artists. That, to me, will never fulfill their mission of broadening public access to the arts. 
Fully 85 percent of the 1997 grantees were past recipients of NEA largess-- 
85 percent. That is not going out and fostering new artists, new writers, new sculptors. 
Here are the issues before the Senate. No. 1, accountability. As the proponents of the NEA come down, they have not responded to the NEA's own IG report which listed the abuses, things like 63 percent of the grantees that had project costs that were not reconcilable to accounting records, 79 percent with inadequate documentation of personal costs charged to the grant, 53 percent failed to engage independent auditors to conduct grant audits as required by the OMB. 
No one responded to that. I listened and listened. No one would respond to the inspector general's report or the General Accounting Office's evaluation of the NEA and how it operates. So accountability is an issue. 
Local control is an issue. Do we want to continue to say yes to Washington bureaucrats, or do we want to say yes to local control of how these dollars are spent? 
Third, the issue is fairness and funding. Under the proposal of Senator Sessions and myself we have offered an amendment that will allow 45 States to receive more for arts. I hope that all of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate will pick up the `Dear Colleague' on their desk that we so often overlook. If Members look up your State, you will see exactly how much more will be available for arts education or available for the local artists under our amendment as opposed to the status quo. 
Say no to Washington. Say yes to local control. Say yes to the Hutchinson-Sessions amendment. 
If there are no opponents here to speak I yield to the cosponsor of this amendment, Senator Sessions.

<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. First, I commend the Senator from Connecticut for his creative and innovative ideas on how we might truly have endowment of the arts. I hope that everyone understands on both sides of this debate that there is support for funding for the arts. The issue is the National Endowment--the so-called National Endowment for the Arts. 
As I have listened to the proponents of the NEA, I have heard glowing commendations and glowing reports about arts in America. But what I have failed to hear anyone respond to--and the question I would pose to the Senator from Connecticut--is the very I think deplorable record that the NEA has established, both in its administrative costs and over 18 cents on the dollar, by a nickel more per dollar, than the National Endowment for the Humanities, or other Federal agencies. 
The inspector general, who, in conducting his grantee audits from 1991 to 1996, found that absolutely deplorable record of audits, a lack of accountability without knowledge of where the money was going, who was spending it, who was receiving it. It is that kind of slipshod management that has put a question mark over I think the future of the NEA. And when we talk about funding for the arts, only 5 percent of the Federal involvement in the arts at the Federal level is the NEA. There are literally hundreds of billions of dollars being spent at the Federal level in support of various arts programs and other agencies and departments. It is not a matter of pulling out the Federal role in arts. 
I would welcome the response.

<DOCNO>105-hutchinson-ar-15-19970917</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I will take just a few minutes that we have remaining to respond to some of the statements made by the opponents of the amendment. I remind Senator Reed, incidentally, the State of Rhode Island would gain $123,000 in additional funds for arts spending in Rhode Island under the block grant amendment that Senator Sessions and myself have offered. I remind each Senator that they can check on their desks here in the Senate Chamber exactly how much, but 45 States will receive more funds under this amendment to support the arts within their own States. 
I was interested that Senator Reed spoke of the shriveling of the arts. If we take this pittance, this relative pittance, in view of the Federal budget, of $100 million and we remove that National Endowment funding, that national entity, that somehow the arts in this country would begin to shrivel. I think, in all due respect, the Senator from Rhode Island underestimates the American people, underestimates the arts community in the United States, and underestimates how much the arts flourish today without a huge injection of Federal funds. 
As an example, the Metropolitan Opera, which has a total income of $133 million, the Lyric Opera, which has an annual income of $37 million, the Boston Symphony, which has an annual income of $43 million, and the Art Institute of Chicago, which has an annual income of $96 million--all of them receiving NEA grants. Most of these wealthy organizations experienced significant cuts in NEA funding in the last 2 years. Yet, in spite of those cuts in NEA funding, each one reported dramatic increases in total income in 1996. The point being that even as funding cuts in the NEA have occurred, arts in this country have continued to flourish. 
But I will tell you what is offensive to me. What is offensive to me is that the Metropolitan Opera is getting an NEA grant. What is offensive to me is the Boston Symphony, with a $43 million income, is getting an NEA grant, while the Opera Theater in 
Wildwood, in Little Rock, AR, got $4,000. The mission of the NEA was to broadly increase access to the arts. That is not what is happening. Mr. President, 85 percent of the grantees in the last fiscal year have been previous recipients of NEA funds. That is not increasing access to the arts. 
So I suggest that, if we really care about the arts, removing the Washington bureaucracy, sending the money to the States, allowing those closest to the people to make those decisions, will be far wiser and far more productive for arts in this country. 
I have raised great issues as to the priorities of the National Endowment, the decisions they are making. The State of Arkansas--you know, I heard Senator Dodd. I have the greatest respect for him.

<DOCNO>105-hutchinson-ar-16-19970917</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to yield, but let me finish my point. I have the greatest respect for Senator Dodd, but he spoke of, `Let's not concentrate on the few bad grants, let's concentrate on the 100,000 good grants.' When he said that, I thought about Arkansas, because we got one last year. We made 12 applications and we received 1, for the Arts Council in Arkansas. 
So I have great questions about the priorities. In Arkansas, the NEA spent 17 cents for every man, woman and child in Arkansas; 17 cents. In New York State the NEA spent $1 for every man, woman and child in New York State. 
I'm sorry, everybody says, `Give the NEA a chance.' We have given them chance after chance after chance. Year after year these objections and these concerns have been raised. We see no reform. We see no change. Instead we see arrogant elitism. And I say it is time to end the NEA. Don't end support for the arts--no. But end this Washington bureaucracy, send that money back so Rhode Island will have another $123,000, so Arkansas will have another $700,000, so Alabama him have another half-million dollars, so the States all over this country can do more for those artists, for those schoolchildren who, too often, fall through the cracks. 
I believe that the amendment that we have offered makes eminent common sense. 
I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Sessions, Senator Ashcroft, and Senator Abraham for their work on behalf of this amendment. It does not change the appropriations for the arts; it is $100 million, block granted to the States. There is a chart down in the well. Everybody has seen what their State will do. Forty-five States will have more resources for arts funding under this amendment. 
The National Endowment has simply failed on their mission to broaden public access to the arts. One-third of the congressional districts in this country get zero from the National Endowment for the Arts. One-third of the funding of the NEA goes to six cities. This is unfair. 
The issue is simply local control. The issue is more resources for art. I ask my fellow Senators to say `yes' to more resources for art and to say `no' to Washington bureaucrats and support this amendment. It means more money for your States to help on those local arts projects. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, this amendment supports one of our most fundamental rights, the right of property ownership. This fundamental right, I believe, is threatened by an Executive order signed by the President on September 11 designating the American Heritage Rivers Initiative. This initiative is intended `to help communities and protect the river resources in a way that integrates natural resource protection, economic development, and the preservation of historic and cultural values.' 
Who could be opposed to that? That, I think, is a goal that all of us share. However, in the eyes of those who live along these historic rivers, this initiative is just another Washington power grab for valuable river front property. It is another Washington intrusion under the guise of a program that has never--has never--been authorized or appropriated. 
This Executive order allows for eight Cabinet Departments--the Departments of Defense, Justice, Transportation, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, and Energy--along with four Government agencies--the EPA, the NEA, the NEH, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation--to decide what happens to America's rivers. I ask you, what does a Washington bureaucrat know about the Arkansas River or the White River, or any of the 16 leading candidates to be designated as American heritage rivers? 
I have listened to my constituents, and they want vibrant river front communities that are reflective of the needs of the values of the local community in which they live and work. They want a community-led process that will make the right decisions for their particular community, not a federally dominated process that could dictate to property owners how they can use their land. 
The amendment that I offer allows for the river front renaissance that so many of our communities desperately need, while offering protections for the average property owner and members of the community that must live with the decisions that are made. 
My amendment provides the necessary safeguard for property owners and communities, while at the same time allowing these river communities to benefit from the Federal funds that are available to improve their polluted or damaged river areas and spur economic development. 
Specifically, my amendment requires that the list of 10 rivers, nominated through the American Rivers Heritage Initiative, be submitted for congressional review. It also ensures that the nominations for the initiative will be subject to existing priorities that have been established by the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
Most importantly, this amendment ensures protection of private property owners who live and own property along the river proposed for nomination as an American heritage river. It requires that all property owners holding title to land directly abutting the river bank shall be consulted, shall be asked to offer letters of support or letters of opposition to the nomination as an American heritage river. 
This amendment also protects vital community interests by defining what constitutes a river community. Under the Executive order--a flawed Executive order, indeed--anyone who is so inclined can nominate a river or have input into the nomination process without any relationship--business, property ownership, any kind of connection--anywhere near the river under consideration. 
My amendment defines the river community as those persons who own property, reside, or who regularly conduct business within 10 miles of the river considered for designation. This ensures that the real interest of the community is truly reflected in the development, design, and operation of a river that receives the designation of an American heritage river. 
This, I think, is an important issue. It is an issue that many of my constituents have been energized about. It has just recently come onto the scene, in one sense, because the Executive order was issued September 11, and the President is seeking to implement this. So I think it is appropriate for us on this Interior appropriations bill to provide some safeguards and to ensure that while the initiative moves forward, that the right of the property owners along these rivers is protected; that there is a process that is in place to ensure that those who are most vitally affected by the initiative will have input in the process, will have some input, have some say as to whether or not that river should be so designated. 
While it ensures the environmental protections of the Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act, it will also ensure that these communities, many times with damaged rivers and polluted waters, will have access to vital Federal funds to ensure that those communities can be reinvigorated. 
So I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment as a safeguard for private property and for American communities. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

<DOCNO>105-hutchinson-ar-2-19970916</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. The Senator explained some, I think, valid points concerning the role of our Government support for the arts. My question concerns the very, very high administrative costs that the National Endowment has experienced, approaching 20 cents on the dollar in administration, and the fact that the distribution of the funds from the National Endowment have gone primarily to very few cities in the country. In fact, I think one-third of all of the direct grants go to six cities in the United States. And the fact is that the Whitney Museum in one exhibit received $400,000, received as much as the entire State of Arkansas last year. 
So my question is, if we are to continue a Government role in funding the arts, would it not be better to eliminate the National Endowment, block grant those funds directly to the States, cutting out the 20 percent in administrative costs and the inequities in the funding formulas for the funding decisions of the National Endowment--and of course I have offered an amendment that would do exactly that--and provide 45 of the 50 States with more money for the arts than they currently receive under the status quo approach that we find in this bill?

<DOCNO>105-hutchinson-ar-3-19970916</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Just responding to some of the comments of my colleague concerning the National Endowment for the Arts and the need to preserve and maintain that national entity, I think that if the record is examined, as it has been examined by the General Accounting Office and the inspector general's office, that the record of the National Endowment is not only deplorable but fails to justify its continued funding and continued existence. 
The issue of whether or not the Government plays a role in funding for the arts aside, the best means of providing the limited funding, the $100 million approximately that has been appropriated for arts this year directly in the NEA, I think is clear that that money would best be used by eliminating the existence of the National Endowment and allowing the funds to flow directly to the Governors, to the various States for distribution to those programs and those projects and those artists within the States that are most deserving. 
In fact, the notion that we are better off with a national endowment that funds six States disproportionately, that funds certain congressional districts and certain States disproportionately, cannot be validated and cannot continue to be justified. 
We have a General Accounting Office report indicating that the administrative costs of the NEA, at almost 20 cents on the dollar, is higher than most other Federal agencies, much, much higher than the National Endowment for the Humanities. 
The mission statement for the National Endowment is simply that they are to broaden access to the arts. In effect, they are mandated to provide arts to underserved areas in this country. Yet, if you look at where the National Endowment today is sending those funds, it in no way corresponds to the mission that they have been given by this Congress to serve those areas which are, if you will, culturally deprived or who have less access to these arts programs. 
Six cities getting over one-third of the direct grants from the NEA cannot be justified. When we had--and the chairman is on the floor this morning--our hearing on the National Endowment in April, and Jane Alexander came in and testified before us, I questioned her as to why, in view of the mission of the NEA to provide arts for underserved areas, in view of that mission, why, out of 12 grant proposals from the State of Arkansas last year, was only 1 approved and the Arkansas Arts Council got approximately $400,000 last year. That equates to little more than many grants for single exhibits across this country. 
Her answer was that it is only in certain select States that we find the environment such to foster the arts. And she gave the analogy of growing apples. She said, apples grow everywhere, but there are certain areas of the country in which they are more productive. I think the implication that there are parts of this country that do not have potential artists, there are parts of this country that among their populations do not have those ready to blossom into writers and sculptors and authors, I think, is the very epitome of the elitism that the American people find so offensive by the National Endowment. 
So to my colleagues who believe that there is an important role that the Government plays in subsidizing and supporting arts, to those of my colleagues who feel very adamantly that we must show our support to culture and to the arts in general in this country by providing some seed money, I ask you to consider the possibility that we would be far better off eliminating the controversial and I think indefensible actions of the National Endowment, eliminate the NEA as it has traditionally existed, and allow that appropriation, exactly the same amount of money, the $100 million to be sent directly to the States on this basis: A $500,000 grant to every State, $200,000 to every territory, the remainder of the appropriation to be distributed on a strictly per capita basis. 
I ask you, could anything be more fair than that? If we took that simple formula, and we said that there will only be 1 percent spent for administrative costs on the Federal level, that the Department of Treasury can spend no more than $1 million to write those checks, and that the State arts councils or the State legislatures or the Governors can spend no more than 15 percent in overhead, that if we adopt that simple formula, the result is that 45 of the 50 States will come out ahead, that 45 of the 50 States will have more resources to fund arts in their States than under the current status quo which this bill, with all due respect, maintains. 
I simply ask my colleagues in the Senate, how can we, with a straight face, no matter which side we are on on the concept of whether the Government ought to be involved in the arts, how can we, with a straight face, face our constituents and say, we are going to defend 20 percent administrative costs, we are going to defend one-third of the grants going to six cities, we are going to defend three-fourths of the grants going to congressional districts represented by Democrats? 
I just want to tell you, Mr. President, I do not believe those congressional districts represented by Democrats in this country are intrinsically less cultured or more culturally deprived or in more need of those arts grants than those congressional districts that happen to be represented by Republicans. Yet there has been a clear bias, with 75 cents out of every $1 going to congressional districts represented by Democrats. 
It has been very selective funding by a group of elitists in Washington, bureaucrats in Washington, who make themselves the arbiters of what is good art and what is culture and where it should be funded. 
So I say consider an option that would say we will end the National Endowment, we will block grant the money to the States on a fair, fair, fair formula based upon the resident population. The result is that 45 States are going to have more money for the arts, more money to help the local writer, more money to go to the schools for education programs in the arts, more money to help that struggling artist who may not have an opportunity and may not happen to live in the six blessed cities that have been honored by the NEA with over one-third of the grants. 
So when this amendment is debated and when this amendment is voted on, I trust later today, I ask my colleagues to look at that breakdown, to look at that chart, and to consider the fact that their State will come out ahead, that their Governor, their State legislature, or their State arts council will have more money to support their local efforts than under the status quo. 
Remember that we are not responsible to a few culture elitists. We are responsible to our constituents in our States for how those limited resources are spent and how we can support the arts. I believe it is fair. I believe it is equitable. I believe it makes eminent common sense. If we will just break out of our lock that the status quo has held over us in the disproportionate influence that this group at the NEA has had in this Congress and consider that there might be a better way, then I think the moral high ground is certainly on behalf of this amendment. I ask my colleagues to support it later today. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his question and thank him for his support and cosponsorship of this amendment. 
My answer is an unequivocal yes, that is accurate; the incidents that Senator Helms cited, to my knowledge, are accurate. And I secondly answer your question by saying, yes, there are many institutions in Arkansas very interested in the arts, very interested in promoting the arts within the State of Arkansas, many that have a great relationship with the local schools and foster arts education in those local schools who would rejoice at having additional funds. 
The State of Arkansas would more than double what would be available for arts in the State of Arkansas by going to the block grant approach. 
Senator Gregg, commenting earlier, was defending the distribution of these funds to a few select cities--one-third of all grants going to six cities. I say that many of those institutions currently receiving grants, like the Boston Symphony or like the Metropolitan Opera, are very well endowed, have very high annual incomes, have a huge base of support, and are less needy and less dependent upon any kind of Federal help than, say, the University of Arkansas or the University of Central Arkansas, or the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, or the many other fine institutions in Arkansas that would be able to work with our local schools and the Arkansas Arts Council, which received just a little over $400,000 last year. That was all the State of Arkansas received. The Whitney Museum by itself received almost as much as the State of Arkansas, and if I am correct, I believe the State of Alabama was in a similar dilemma.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. That, of course, is the whole concept behind our amendment--local control. Send the money back to the States, the Governors, the State legislatures, and the State arts council would have the discretion to increase funding. 
In the case of Alabama, and I do not have the exact numbers in front of me, but the amount of resources available to the State of Alabama would be greatly enhanced under the block grants approach in which we send a $500,000 grant to every State, and then simply distribute it on a per capita basis. That would allow the State of Alabama to give much more to the Shakespearean theater. 
I was interested to hear your comments yesterday quoting Anthony Hopkins and his appreciation for that Shakespeare theater there in Montgomery. 
So the needed resources would be much more available, and that would be controlled locally. So insomuch as there was local support in Alabama for increased funding, I think the opportunity would be much enhanced. 
Frankly, I am puzzled why anyone would oppose the approach that you and I are offering. I can understand the 5 States that would lose funding being opposed to this, but the 45 States and the Senators from the 45 States that would see their funding for the arts increased under our approach while eliminating bureaucracy in Washington, it is really difficult for me to see how someone objects to that.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Senator Sessions, you are exactly right. One of the areas that this Republican-controlled Congress has pushed for most strongly has been local control. In welfare reform, in a whole host of areas, we said, `Let's flow that power back out of Washington, back to the States.' 
There is no better example, I think, of where we could do that than in the area of the arts. We not only have a 20-percent overhead that we are paying just by having this bureaucracy of almost 150 employees dispensing this money, but we have a small group that makes decisions on what will be funded across this country, if you will, making themselves the arbiters of what is good art, and the control of our constituents is minimized because of the distance, the inability to really affect the decisions that are made. 
So, yes, I think the citizens of Alabama, the citizens of my home State of Arkansas, will have much greater input dealing with the Arkansas Arts Council or the Alabama Legislature, or the Governor's office than trying to affect the decisions that are made in Washington, DC, by a select group.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I believe those local schools in rural communities across our States and all across this country have a much more legitimate claim to those funds than where those funds have gone under the current status quo of the NEA. 
I grew up in a town with a population, when I lived there, of 894. I can remember in junior high school it being one of the great thrills when we were able to take a field trip 40 miles to the University of Arkansas and watch a Shakespearean play. That is the first time I had ever seen a Shakespearean play. 
Those kind of opportunities to the small communities of this country would be increased so much if we eliminated the Washington bureaucracy and allowed that money to flow back to the States. 
The objectionable art, Senator Sessions, that you cited yesterday, that Senator Helms spent a great deal of time on, that has characterized much of the debate around the NEA in recent years--if a local arts council, the State arts council, or State legislature or Governor made a decision to fund something that the mass of the people found highly objectionable, I guarantee you they will be more responsible in that State legislature or that State arts council, or that Governor will be far more responsive to the complaints of the people than a faraway bureaucracy in Washington, DC, in some ivory tower making those decisions.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. We have heard many arguments over the years that the National Endowment for the Arts [NEA] is not living up to its original intent of `broadening public access to the arts.' In fact, in NEA's original mandate and mission statement, they are charged with the responsibility of broadening public access to the arts. That is the key question: Have they really fulfilled that? We have heard a lot of debate through the years as to whether the NEA has really fulfilled that mandate. 
In fact, one-third of the Federal share currently goes to six of the largest cities in the country. The agency, in addition to sending most of those direct grants to six large cities, has also demonstrated soaring administrative costs. Nearly 20 percent of every dollar that the National Endowment for the Arts expends is spent in overhead here in Washington, DC--much more than most of the Federal agencies--even more, for instance, than the National Endowment for Humanities (NEH). NEH's overhead costs are much, much less than that 19 to 20 percent figure. 
Furthermore, the NEA continues to fund what many Americans believe is objectionable art. While we have heard a lot of debate on those issues--the administrative costs, the formula, whether or not it is fulfilling its mandate--very few actual solutions have been offered. 
So, this afternoon, I want to present what I think is a common-sense solution to the problems that we have seen in the National Endowment for the Arts. I ask the question: What happens to the novice artist, or the songwriter in middle America, when the NEA funnels one-third of its direct grant funds to only six cities? Those cities are New York, Boston, MA, Los Angeles, CA, Chicago, IL, San Francisco, CA, and the District of Columbia. Each one of these six cities already has well-established arts communities. Yet, the NEA continues to pour a huge amount of its limited resources--over one-third of its direct grants--to those six cities. 
So what happens to that new artist, that songwriter just starting out in Arkansas, or in the State of Oklahoma, or in Iowa, or the startup band in Small Town, U.S.A., who doesn't have their dreams realized, when one-fifth of direct grants are sent to multimillion dollar arts organizations who already benefit from over $11 billion in private giving each year? In fact, the private giving to the arts, combined with what is spent and purchased on tickets, is almost equal to that which is spent on professional sports in this country. 
And most tragic of all, I believe, is: What about the children? As my colleague, Senator Hutchison from Texas, spoke so eloquently on, the children in rural towns across this Nation who only dream of ever seeing the lavish theaters in New York City--what happens to them when they are denied the opportunity to perform a school play because bureaucrats in Washington awarded $400,000 to the Whitney Museum for one single exhibit rather than their school play? 
Mr. President, how can we justify this kind of very, very selective spending? For instance, in the State of Arkansas, the average per-person expenditure from the National Endowment for the Arts amounted to, if you divided it up for every man, woman, and child in the State, 17 cents per person. The State of Arkansas has a per capita income of about $18,000. My home State received, out of the $99.5 million appropriated for fiscal year 1997, approximately 17 cents per person. And then we turn around and look at the State of 
Massachusetts, which has a per capita income of $30,000--not quite, but almost twice the income in the State of Arkansas--and the National Endowment for the Arts has decided in its infinite wisdom to spend 60 cents per person in the State of Massachusetts. 
That is what I regard as very selective spending. In the State of Mississippi, with a per capita income of about $18,000 per person, they received about 25 cents per person from the NEA last year, while the State of New York, which has a per capita income of $29,000 per person, received $1 per person from the National Endowment for the Arts. After looking more closely at the per capita numbers, the NEA used very selective funding. The Midwestern State of Iowa, with a per capita income of $22,000, received 20 cents per person, while the State of Maryland, with a higher per capita income of $27,000, received more than twice the per capita expenditure than the State of Iowa--Maryland received 45 cents per person. That is very, very selective spending on the part of the National Endowment for the Arts. How can we justify that? 
Then when you break it down by political party, it becomes even more intriguing. Last year, NEA funding totaling close to $45 million was sent to congressional districts represented by Democrats in Congress, while about $14 million was sent to congressional districts represented by Republicans across the country. If you break that down by the number of direct grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, you find that almost 1,300 direct grants went to congressional districts represented by Democrats, while only 408 went to congressional districts represented by Republicans. 
When the funding is broken down per district, on average, about $223,000 was sent to districts represented by Democrats, and on average, about $60,000--almost one-fourth--went to congressional districts represented by Republicans. And you can go on and on. 
The fact is that $3 out of every $4 going to the States is going to congressional districts represented by Democrats. That is very selective funding. As one observer in Arkansas said, `Why not send the $100 million to the Democratic National Committee and cut out the middle man?' It has become a very selective funding formula used by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Well, I cannot and will not justify what I think is inequitable and out-of-control spending by an elitist agency rife with problems and abuses. 
So, Mr. President, it is time to bring this funding into line and it is time for a solution. So I rise today, along with several of my colleagues, to offer a solution. I see Senator Sessions here on the floor. I hope he will speak as a cosponsor of this amendment. I offer a solution that gets the money down to the artists, the songwriters, that startup band, that local writer, the painter on the local level and, most importantly, down to our children--a solution that fulfills the NEA's original mandate and mission statement of `broadening public access to the arts.' 
When you look at what is spent in Mississippi as compared to what is spent in New York, or in Massachusetts as compared to what is spent in Iowa, I think there is no one who can, with a straight face, defend the National Endowment for the Arts and say they are fulfilling their mission statement of broadening public access to the arts. 
So the amendment I am offering today supports my belief that there are potential artists everywhere and in every corner of every State. From the plains of Wyoming to the mountains in West Virginia, from the Mississippi Delta to the potato fields of Iowa, we have budding artists, potential artists, everywhere. 
Contrary to Jane Alexander's notion that `the areas of nurturing and development of artists tend to be located in a few States . . .'--by the way, Jane Alexander made that statement in our April hearing before the Labor and Human Resources Committee.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Ms. Alexander said, `* * * the areas of nurturing and development of artists tend to be located in a few States * * *' I take great exception to that. In fact, I take great offense to that statement. I believe artists are everywhere--in every city, town, and county across this Nation, in every home, in every schoolyard, in every playground in America. It is time that talent is recognized and realized. It is time that the elitist attitude that says that the pools of artistic talent in this country are restricted to a few small States is rejected once and for all. In fact, my home State of Arkansas is the home State to many famous artists; John Grisham, author; William McNamara, painter; Billy Bob Thornton, Academy Award winner for his role in `Slingblade'; Mary Steenburgen, actress; Vance Randolph, famous folklorist; and Maya Angelou, famous poet. On and on the list goes. 
So the pool of talent in this country is not restricted to a few States where we should put our limited resources from the National Endowment. 
Simply put, my proposal would cut out the Washington middleman and send the arts dollars down to the States so that those who are closest to the unknown writer, the start-up band, or the schoolchild, can make the decisions as to where those wise investments will be made to those individuals who might otherwise have been passed over for the well-endowed Whitney Museum or the Boston Symphony, which has a $43 million annual income, or the Art Institute of Chicago, which has a $96 million annual income, or the Metropolitan Opera, which has $133 million in total annual income. In giving grants to those great, but well-endowed institutions, we rob from those who need it most and who would best fulfill the mandate that the National Endowment espouses. 
Additionally, by getting the decisionmaking out of Washington, the nearly 20 percent in administrative overhead the agency currently maintains is virtually abolished. That 20 percent currently being spent on administrative overhead in Washington would be awarded back to the States. It is the artists all across America who win under this proposal, who stand to be recognized by their home State rather than by a bloated bureaucracy in Washington. 
In fact, as we will demonstrate on this chart--and I hope that all of my colleagues in the Senate will take a look--we will have a handout for them--45 out of 50 States will gain under this block grant proposal. Cut out the 20-percent administrative overhead, limit administrative costs to 1 percent, write the checks to the Governors, send it to the States' art councils or to the State legislatures, and in so doing we will have more resources to send directly to those who will benefit most from them. 
In fact, all but a few States--45 out of 50--will increase arts dollars compared to last year. Most notably, for Senators Mack and Graham from the State of Florida--Florida will receive almost $3.4 million more than last year, while the artists in Texas, Senator Hutchison's State, will benefit from close to $3 million more than in fiscal year 1997. How do we do that? We take that 20 percent bloated administrative cost in Washington, eliminate the National Endowment, let the Secretary of the Treasury write a check to the Governors to go through the legislature or the State arts councils, limit State administrative spending to 15 percent, impose strict auditing requirements, award a $500,000 basic grant to each State, and then expend the remainder of those dollars under a per capita formula--45 out of 50 States will be winners. Florida, $3.4 million; Texas, $3 million. This commonsense solution seeks to give the dollars directly to the States in an equitable fashion, particularly to many underserved areas, and, most importantly, permits more local control of this money. 
Moreover, this proposal includes clear and precise language requiring States to conduct strict audits on the Federal dollars they receive, as well as submit a report for public inspection within that State. Let the public know how the money is being spent. Let the public have the reassurance that audits are being performed and that strict accounting measures are being followed. Any State found to have misused their Federal funds under the guidelines set forth in this amendment will be required to repay the money, plus a 10-percent penalty, to the Treasury. 
Mr. President, in my efforts to find a solution to the current inequities that exist in the distribution of arts dollars, I solicited feedback on this proposal from a number of individuals, including our current Governor of the State of Arkansas, Gov. Mike Huckabee. We had staff talk with his staff. I personally talked with Governor Huckabee, and was encouraged by his enthusiastic response to this block grant approach. I asked him point blank, `Would Arkansas benefit from having more control over arts dollars for the budding artists, musicians, writers, and actors in Arkansas?'

<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, Governor Huckabee wrote, `As a State, we have a need for the continued support of developing art talents, as well as making the arts available to the public.' Then Governor Huckabee went on to state that he `believes States have a better understanding of their needs and a much closer relationship with our constituents at the State level than a bureaucracy in Washington.' 
I think what Governor Huckabee said would be echoed by Governors--both Democrat and Republican--all across this country; that, if they could receive those funds directly, have control over them, be able to make the decisions as to where those grants should go, we will have a more productive arts community in each one of our States. 
Mr. President, it becomes increasingly harder to justify the existence of the National Endowment for the Arts' Washington bureaucracy when one takes a more careful look at the overhead and the salary costs of this agency. 
For example, from 1994 to 1996, the administrative costs of the National Endowment for the Arts went from a little over 14 percent in 1994, 14.4 percent, to almost 19 percent in 1996, at a time when the agency was cut by 39 percent, and was faced with a loss of 89 positions. The administrative costs amount to almost 20 cents on the dollar. At a time when the NEA was cutting budgets and the number of positions at the agency, administrative costs as a percentage of their budget went up to nearly 20 cents on every dollar of our constituents' hard-earned paychecks. 
My constituents in Arkansas wonder why it costs almost $19 million to distribute just over $50 million in NEA direct grant funds. They wonder for good reason--$19 million to distribute $50 million. These are their hard-earned tax dollars on the line. I don't doubt that many of my colleagues' constituents have exactly the same questions. 
A closer analysis of how the NEA spends its administrative budget raises even further questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency. While the agency repeatedly complains of the draconian effects of the budget cuts on its staff, over 68 percent of the 154 individuals currently employed by the NEA earn over $50,000 per year. Let me repeat that. The agency complains about the burden that they are facing under the budget cuts that have been imposed over the last couple of years, but at the same time over 68 percent of their staff out of 154 individuals employed by the NEA, are earning over $50,000 per year. That is the equivalent of an average constituent in Arkansas earning three yearly salaries in just 1 year. 
To make matters worse, the NEA's own inspector general uncovered significant problems, deficiencies, and abuses during its audit of grantees from 1991 to 1996. This chart demonstrates some of the inspector general's findings--not a Republican committee nor a Republican chairman--but the NEA's own inspector general found this: 
Sixty-three percent of the grantees had project costs that were not reconcilable to their accounting records. That is well over half. Sixty-three percent of the grantees could not reconcile their accounting records. 
Seventy-nine percent, over three-fourths, had inadequate documentation of personnel costs charged to the grant. That is money going to individuals. That is personnel salaries that are unaccountable, according to the NEA's own inspector general. 
Fifty-three percent had failed to engage independent auditors to conduct grant audits as is required by OMB guidelines. The Office of Management and Budget requires that these audits be conducted, and over half did not do so. 
I am curious. Those who are advocates of the National Endowment, those who are advocates of maintaining the status quo--and I heard them speak on the floor of the Senate today--they speak eloquently on behalf of art; they speak eloquently on behalf of culture. But I have not heard any of them respond to these 
findings conducted by the inspector general that find blatant misuse of taxpayers' funds. Fifty-three percent--over half--not even complying with the Office of Management and Budget's requirement for independent audits. 
These numbers are alarming. They are intolerable. They compel us to change the status quo. The best way we can change it is to rid the country of the National Endowment and send the money down to the States where it can truly go to benefit arts on the local level and fulfill the original intent and mandate of the NEA. As if this scenario is not gruesome enough, how is it justifiable that the NEA assisted in promoting the President's William D. Ford Federal Direct Student Loan Program? That is correct--the NEA, under an interagency agreement with the Department of Education, provided design assistance for marketing materials promoting the President's Direct Student Loan Program. This is the National Endowment for the Arts. This is the agency originally established to broaden access to the arts in this country. This was the agency established so that underserved areas like Virginia, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Alabama with start-up artists who want the opportunity to build a future in the arts community, would receive funding for these purposes. Instead, we find a grant going for surely a strictly political and not arts-oriented program--the promotion of the President's Direct Student Loan Program. You can take any position you want on the President's Direct Student Loan Program, whether that is the right way to go or not, but to use NEA funds to promote it--that is indefensible. 
Although the NEA claims that the Department of Education reimbursed the agency $100,000 under this agreement, the NEA reports that they have no accounting of the time or expenses they incurred in providing those services. 
Mr. President, how much more mismanagement of taxpayer money will we tolerate? When is enough, enough? Well, enough is enough for me. 
Mr. President, I cannot sit idly by while our tax dollars are used and abused by a Washington bureaucracy. 
The proposal I am offering today, along with several of my colleagues, is the fair solution to an agency run amok. It sends arts money directly to the States, eliminating the high administrative costs currently plaguing the agency. It shifts control from Washington bureaucrats to those closest to our artists and calls for strict auditing by the States. It initiates a more equitable distribution of Federal arts dollars on a per capita basis, benefiting more currently underserved areas, and significantly increasing the award amounts for all but a few States. Most of all, it makes good on the original mission of the NEA--to broaden public access to the arts. 
The horrendous realities I have outlined today have compelled many, including myself, to the conclusion that, over the years, the NEA has failed to live up to its legislative mandate of increasing access to the arts and has gotten into the business of picking favorites--making the National Endowment the arbiters of art in our culture. 
In summary, the NEA is rife with abuses: extravagant administrative costs; poor management, and a vacuum of oversight, according to the GAO; glaring inequities in distribution; a biased process where the East does better than the South, the big cities do better than rural America, Democratic districts do three times better than Republican districts, higher-income States fare better than lower-income States, and the haves get more and the have-nots continue to have not; 
wholesale failure to fulfill its original mission to broaden public access to the arts, and the adoption of a kind of trickle-down arts theory in which the arbiters of art reside primarily in Washington, DC. My amendment would end publicly subsidized cultural elitism by sending these decisions back to the States, more money for the arts and less for the bureaucrats, more resources for 45 of the 50 States and less for 5 States, more accountability and more local control. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is fair. It is equitable. It is common sense. And the artists, musicians, and writers in your home State depend upon the resources that this amendment will make available. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

 Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today full of sadness. Mr. William Powell of Bella Vista, AR, has recently passed away. 
I came to know Mr. Powell as 1 of the 82 American airmen that were held prisoner of war at the Buchenwald concentration camp during World War II. During my tenure in Congress, I have introduced two resolutions that would have given appropriate and well-deserved recognition to this group of World War II prisoners. 
These brave airmen were different from other allied prisoners, because they were held at Buchenwald--a Nazi concentration camp--and therefore not subject to the protections of the Geneva Convention. 
Tragically, Mr. President, the United States has never formally recognized the service, sacrifice, and bravery of these American airmen while they were held as political prisoners. Even more tragically, the United States and this Congress will never have the opportunity to express our admiration to Mr. Powell. 
When I introduced Senate Concurrent Resolution 32 in this Congress, on Thursday, June 12, I contacted Mr. Powell. He responded by saying, and I quote: 
The recognition is long overdue. For decades, the Department of Defense and the International Red Cross have stated that there were no military personnel in Buchenwald. Yet as someone who was imprisoned there for 4 months, I know of at least 55 other American soldiers who endured the hardships of this camp. Two men even lost their lives there. And nearly all suffered diseases later in life because of the treatment they received while in Buchenwald. 
In the late 70s, early 80s, I joined with the other survivors of Buchenwald to push this government to recognize our service. We never wanted any money, we just wanted the United States Government to say, `Yes you were there, and we appreciate what you went through.' 
Mr. William Powell was a good man, a true patriot, and while this resolution that I spoke of earlier, Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, has yet to pass this body, I urge my colleagues to join with me in passing it, in honor of Mr. William Powell. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his family.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my friend and colleague Congressman Jim Saxton, to submit a concurrent resolution that condemns, in the strongest possible terms, today's bombing in Jerusalem on Ben Yehuda Street. 
Three bombs exploded in Jerusalem today killing at least 8 people and injuring more than 165 others. Mr. President, once again the world watches in horror as innocent citizens get blown up in a Jerusalem marketplace. 
Just weeks after a tragic bombing incident in July, Yasser Arafat publicly embraced the leader of Hamas. Two weeks later, today, three more bombs kill and maim civilians on a crowded shopping street in Jerusalem. 
Mr. President, I am outraged by these continued terrorist actions under the watch of the Palestinian Authority. 
Mr. President, among other things, the resolution that I offer today would require Congress to: 
Reaffirm that the United States should fully cooperate with the state of Israel in helping to stem the tide of terrorism, which has threatened the Oslo process and the stability of this vital region; express its deepest condolences to the families of the victims of this latest bombing and express its solidarity with the people of the State of Israel; and affirm that the United States should provide no monetary or other assistance to the Palestinian Authority until it has fulfilled its obligations under the Oslo accords. 
To many of my colleagues that may not already know this, I have just returned from Israel, where I walked up and down Ben Yehuda street. Therefore, this resolution hits close to home for me. 
Mr. President, it is time for Arafat to live up to the commitments he made in the Oslo accords and break the back of the terrorist infrastructure in Palestine. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in condemning today's terrorist acts and cosponsor this important legislation.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the United Kingdom deregulated its electric utilities in 1990. There is now a central power pool. Power stations with capacities of over 10 megawatts are ordinarily required to sell all electricity generated into the pool. Consumers buy from the pool or from regional electric companies that buy from the pool 
Thus, for example, if an independent generator wanted to build a power station to supply electricity to an oil refinery in England, it might lease land from the refinery and build the power station. However, a direct sale of electricity to the refinery would not be permitted. The generator would sell electricity to the pool, and the refinery would buy from that pool. The pool prices change each half hour based on demand and supply and, therefore, fluctuate frequently. 
The refinery will want protection against price fluctuations. Consequently, it will enter into a contract for differences with the generator. The parties will agree on a schedule of fixed prices that the generator would have charged had the generator been free to make a direct sale. When the pool price exceeds the agreed price in the schedule, the generator will pay the refinery the difference. The refinery will pay the generator the difference when the pool price is less. Thus, the differences contract is a way for both parties to buy certainty. The generator is certain of his revenue stream. The refinery is certain of how much electricity will cost over an extended period. It is a hedging agreement. 
It my understanding that the relevant provision in the bill does not turn payments under such differences contracts into subpart F income. Would the Chairman clarify this understanding?

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, Tuesday, the New York Times stated that the State Department would issue its first report on the worldwide persecution of Christians and this report would be sharply critical of China. That report was, in fact, released this past Wednesday, and I urge all of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to read this report. This is the same report that the State Department originally promised to release to Congress on January 15, over 6 months ago. It is the same report that the State Department promised to release by the end of June, and the same report that the State Department promised to release before the House voted on China's most-favored-nation trading status. 
On June 18 of this year, my good friend and colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, and I sent a letter to both the President and to the Secretary of State, expressing our grave concerns about recent reports that suggested that the State Department was deliberately delaying the release of its findings on religious persecution throughout the world. It was my understanding that this report placed a specific focus on the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities around the world, and that the report singled out China for especially tough criticism. 
It is, in fact, the case, as the report has been issued and as I have surveyed that report, that that criticism is even more scathing than what had been anticipated. As I have stated on this floor many times, the 1996 State Department's human rights report on China revealed that the Chinese authorities had effectively stepped up efforts to suppress expressions of criticism and protest. This report said that all public dissent had been effectively silenced by either exile, imposition of prison terms, or intimidation. This latest report from the State Department, issued this week, further underscores the seriousness of the situation in China and the severity of the crackdown that has been imposed upon those who would express any opinion contrary to that of the Communist government. 
As an original cosponsor of the disapproval resolution on MFN to China, I believe serious human rights abuses persist in all areas of China today and that the continuous delay of this year's report on religious persecution raises the question as to this administration's willingness to engage in an open discussion of the effect of U.S. policy on human rights in China and around the world. 
I urge that the State Department report be delivered in a timely manner to ensure its full disclosure and debate prior to a vote on the extension of MFN to China. It seemed to be only right, only proper that the House and my Senate colleagues would have an opportunity to see the latest and most accurate information as to what is going on in China. That information was denied the House and it was denied my colleagues in the Senate, as we voted on the sense-of-the-Senate resolution last week. I even publicly made a request on the Senate floor for that report to be issued prior to any MFN debate and MFN vote. 
The State Department informed me that I would receive a copy of the report as soon as it was released. Mr. President, the fact was that the New York Times received a copy of this report before Congress did. This year's report states quite clearly that the Chinese Government has consistently violated its own constitutional guarantees of religious rights, cracking down on Catholic and Protestant groups, raiding worship groups 
meeting in private homes, and sometimes detaining and interrogating and even beating religious leaders. Furthermore, the report states: 
The government of China has sought to restrict all actual religious practice to government-authorized religious organizations. Some religious groups have registered, while others were refused registration. 
I want to commend and express my appreciation to Senator Ashcroft from the State of Missouri for his willingness to come to the floor of the Senate this week and express his own outrage at the continuing deterioration of human rights conditions in China. 
Mr. President, I raise this question on the floor of the Senate today: Why was the State Department's report on religious persecution delayed, delayed, and delayed again, so that it was only released after all congressional votes and all congressional debate on MFN was history? 
Mr. President, I have serious concerns that officials of this administration are not willing to engage in an open discussion about United States policy toward China, and I am deeply disturbed about the timing of this report, especially in light of the votes that have transpired in both the House and the Senate in recent weeks. 
The revelation that human rights abuses continue to worsen in China, while our policy remains status quo, I believe, gives our own tacit consent to the terrible atrocities that are occurring in that great country. 
To remain silent when evil is perpetrated and injustice is being inflicted, I think, is to become a participant in that evil. So I urge my colleagues to obtain a copy of this year's report issued this week, read it, study it, and decide what action we should take as a nation against this regime that continues to disregard basic human rights. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
It has been years since this body voted on the most-favored-nation status for China. It has been 8 years since the Tiananmen Square massacre, and it has been 4 years since this Nation embarked on a policy of so-called constructive engagement which delinked our China trade policy from human rights concerns. 
During these years, years since we last voted on MFN, years since the Tiananmen Square massacre, and the 4 years since we embarked upon constructive engagement, this is what has happened in these years: 
The struggling democracy movement in China has been thoroughly and completely squashed. 
Those students at Tiananmen Square, which we watched on television all over this Nation, are all either imprisoned or executed. 
All voices of freedom in China have since been silenced--all of them--according to the 1996 State Department Report on China. All voices of dissidents have been silenced. 
Chinese workers have been systematically exploited. 
Weapons of mass destruction have been exported around the world so that the export of those weapons from China now poses the greatest military risk in the world today. 
And people of faith in China have been persecuted and 
driven underground. 
In addition, during these years, all political dissent has been effectively oppressed, and now there is mounting evidence that, in fact, during these years when we were year after year granting most-favored-nation status, they were attempting to influence the American political process. There is mounting evidence that that was the case. 
So I believe this vote is a vote of conscience. I believe it is a vote that we must have in this body. The abuses of the Chinese Government beg to be protested. 
So when people ask me why this vote? I say because it is so egregious what is going on that we must vote, we must raise our voice, we must let the people of China know that there are people standing up for them in the United States.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, Members can see the beautiful tie I am wearing today. It was manufactured in Little Rock, AR. It is a family business. The owner of the family business that manufactured this tie told me that the greatest threat to his economic viability is the unfair trade practices of Communist China. 
I ask you to vote for this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Suffering is not a term of economics. You cannot add it up, you cannot deduct it, you cannot redeem it in dollars. 
Arguments for MFN always come down to dollars and cents. But to the average Chinese person, you can't build a wall, you can't separate the economics from the human rights violations that are going on. A product of slave labor is inexorably tied and linked to the shackled hands that made it. 
I ask my colleagues, think about the enslaved, think about the oppressed, think about the imprisoned today, think about that voice of freedom that has been silenced, think about that voice of freedom in prison today, and speak for that one who cannot speak for himself. Please vote for this amendment.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I offer amendment No. 890 to the foreign operations appropriations bill. This amendment which is a sense of the Senate, would disapprove the MFN status, most-favored-nation status, to the nation of China. I have opposed the renewal of MFN to China. On June 3 of this year I became an original cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 31, the legislation disapproving the extension of MFN. 
Unfortunately, because of the joint resolution of disapproval in the House, which failed to pass the House of Representatives on June 24, as in past years or at least recent years, the Senate has not considered and has not had the opportunity to weigh in on and to voice its concern about the conditions in China, and particularly to cast a vote on the MFN status for China. 
Today we will have that opportunity with this sense of the Senate. It has been almost 4 years, Mr. President, since the United States formally delinked the issues of trade and human rights with regard to China. Four years ago when we delinked, when we embarked upon our policy of constructive engagement, the logic was that greater trade, greater economic expansion within China itself, would result in political freedom, greater political freedom, less repression, more opportunity for the people of China. 
The fact is, by every measure, the record of the Chinese Government on human rights has worsened since the time that we embarked upon this policy delinking trade and human rights. Whether you look at the crackdown on people of faith within China, whether you look at the practice of forced abortions, forced sterilization of the mentally handicapped, the near extinction of the expression of any opinion that would be contrary to the established line of the Communist Government in Beijing, by any measure, conditions are worse, freedoms are less, oppression is greater than it was 4 years ago when we started this policy of constructive engagement. 
In fact, according to the 1996 country report issued by our own State Department, the U.S. State Department said that the Chinese Communist leaders have succeeded in silencing every known political dissident. Mr. President, that is every dissident, every free voice, every voice of dissent, every contrary opinion to the party line has now been extinguished in Communist China either through exile, through death, or through imprisonment. 
So, Mr. President, I feel very strongly that our current policy of continuing normal trade relations without regard to human rights conditions has been ineffective in stemming this very alarming trend in China 
by turning a blind eye to the atrocities or abdicating our responsibility as a great and a free nation. 
As we have continued to extend China's MFN status, insufficient progress has been made in opening the vast Chinese market to the American companies. The argument has been free trade, increased economic expansion. While our imports from China have increased dramatically during the last 4 years, the amount of goods we export to China has grown at a much, much smaller rate. 
Moreover, Mr. President, China utilizes a vast prison system manned with slave labor to produce many products which are exported to the West. It is unfair to ask American laborers, American workers, to compete with the slave labor of Communist China. I believe in free trade. This is not free trade that we have currently. Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stand guard atop the towers of the slave labor camps, known as Laogai. The PLA controls, either directly or indirectly, a significant portion of the Chinese industry. In fact, according to our CIA, thousands of industries that we are trading with on a routine basis are controlled by the People's Liberation Army. That is not free trade. It is not fair trade. It is not right. 
Mr. President, it is believed that many of these industries are involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, arms smuggling, economic espionage, use of forced labor, piracy of intellectual property, and misinformation of sensitive military technology. 
Mr. President, I know some of my colleagues, perhaps many of my colleagues, feel that this amendment is something they would rather not vote on. This sense of the Senate is something they would rather not have to go on the record on. I think that we are dealing with foreign operations. Section 524 of this bill bars indirect assistance to many countries, including China. So it is relevant. It is germane. It is important that the U.S. Senate have an opportunity to voice our concerns. It is a sense of Senate. It is not binding. It is important we send that signal. 
We may not be able this year--we cannot, obviously, because of the House action--we may not be able to deny MFN status, but we can send a signal, and we should. 
To my colleagues I say there are people watching. The Chinese Government is watching what this Chamber does. The Chinese people are watching. We can send a message that we do not condone the practices, the oppressive totalitarian practices of this government. We can, at the same time, to the tens of thousands, yes, the tens of millions of Chinese who are facing that oppression today, we can say to them there are those in America who stand with them and who will support them in their fight for freedom. 
I know, Mr. President, that there are many bills that have been introduced to deal with China, and I hope that we will deal with that. I hope we will take those bills, whether Senator Brownback's, Senator Abraham's, or whoever may have introduced legislation to address the China question, and we will put that into some kind of omnibus bill in future weeks to send an even stronger message. Until then, this is our opportunity. This is our chance to, once again, give a voice to American foreign policy. This is our opportunity to say to the world and to say to the Chinese Government, America still stands for something, that we do not have a foreign policy void of value, that those values we espouse, which are embodied in our founding documents and in our very Constitution, live on, today, in the policy that we advocate toward China. 
I know there were many who breathed a sigh of relief in the U.S. Senate when MFN went down in the House of Representatives. There was a sense of `we're off the hook.' I say to all of those of my colleagues who have decried the conditions in China today, I say to all of my colleagues who in one form or another have said it is wrong what they are doing over there, to remember that while we may have been off the hook, there are tens of thousands of Chinese people in prison camps today who are still on the hook, this is our chance to give them the voice that their government has denied them. 
I ask my colleagues to look deep within their soul, to look at their conscience, and I ask them to vote in favor of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution disapproving of most-favored-nation status for China. 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I will briefly respond to my distinguished colleagues from Kentucky and California. I feel compelled, as I listen to the arguments that have been raised over and over again, and particularly the phrase that `it is a different China today.' 
Well, it is not my opinion that I am citing today. It is our own State Department's 1996 country report on the conditions in China. So I remind my colleagues on the floor right now that our State Department, in looking at China, said, yes, it is a different China; the difference is that 8 years after the Tiananmen Square massacre, after those brave students stood in front of those tanks, there is not one remaining independent free voice in China today. That is our State Department. Every dissident has either been killed or imprisoned or exiled. There are none of those independent voices. That is the China that exists today. That is what our State Department has said. 
Now, the State Department had a new report they were going to issue. It was supposed to have been out months ago. It was delayed. It was supposed to have been out in June, and it has been further delayed until after the MFN votes were over. I wish the administration had ordered that latest State Department report to be issued so that the Members of the Senate could see what the latest evaluation of the conditions in China really are. The latest we have, in the 1996 country report, is that there are no free voices in China today. 
Now, they say we will isolate China. The same ones who say we are going to isolate China will say we can't deny MFN because they will send all of those goods to Europe, they will find markets for their products in Europe. Let me assure my colleagues, you will not isolate one-fifth of the world's population. And it is a self-contradictory argument to say we dare not isolate them or we will deny our American citizens these goods. 
Now, my dear colleague and distinguished friend from Kentucky said Mr. Clinton had changed his mind when he got elected. Indeed, he did. He commended him for his change of mind. Well, I criticize him for his change of mind. I think he was right when he was a candidate. He then said that it was intolerable that we, as a people of conviction and values, should stand by and close our eyes to what is going on in China. So I regret that he made that change, as he has made changes in many other policies. 
Well, then they say, `It just takes time, just give them time,' and if we will give them time, my colleagues say, we will see political freedom, an increase in their economic opportunities and, as sure as day follows night, political freedom will come. Mr. President, I have been waiting for 4 years. I have been waiting for 4 years for one scintilla of evidence to support that notion. If I could have found just the slightest indication that things were getting better in China, I would have voted for MFN to encourage those positive changes. But by every measure, it has gotten worse, and every objective observer, from Amnesty International, to Family Research Council, to our own State Department, has said it's worse. 
So how can we continue to say, well, business as usual, and if we keep on giving them time, it will get better, when, so far, every time they have thumbed their nose at what we have done. Then we hear that no one calls for it if you go to Hong Kong. I don't know about that, but I do know that if you were in mainland China today, you could not call for it because, if you dared, you would be imprisoned and you would risk your very life and the lives of your loved ones. There are no dissidents left. 
So to my colleagues I say, the vote on this amendment is very simple: to embrace the policy of profits and appeasement, or to embrace the policy of principle and principled challenge to those who would abuse and persecute and execute their own citizens. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I would like to voice my support for the Smith amendment prohibiting foreign assistance to the Government of Russia, should it enact laws that would discriminate against religious minorities and religious faiths in the Russian federation. As you eloquently pointed out, on July 4, and ironically on July 4, as we celebrated our precious freedoms in the United States the Russian Federal Assembly gave final approval to a bill which would seriously undermine religious freedom in Russia. 
I was in Poland just 1 week ago, representing the Senate at an international conference, the Sixth Annual Session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. At this conference, I had the opportunity to chair a bilateral meeting with the Speaker of the Russian Duma and we discussed this bill at length. 
In that bilateral meeting were a number of deputies from the Russian Duma. I found that their concept of rights and freedoms were strikingly in contrast to our concept of freedoms, as embodied in our Constitution and in our American tradition. Repeatedly, as we discussed the proposed law that the Russian Duma at that point had already voted on--the upper body had not yet at that point voted on it--it was clear that they viewed religious freedom, and in fact all rights, as being that which could be granted by the Government as opposed to our concept, embodied in our Constitution and our founding documents, that those rights and those freedoms are unalienable and endowed by our Creator--given by God. Therefore, as viewing rights as being something given by the Government, they saw no problem in removing the unlimited, unfettered right to freedom of religion. 
I was alarmed at the attitude and the intransigence that we found, not only from the Speaker of the Duma but the deputies who were present, and their concept. They said, and I paraphrase but very close to what was said in this bilateral meeting, that we must protect naive Russians from cults--cults being a broad definition to include all of the so-called new faiths. Of course, Russia today is experiencing a tremendous renewal of religious faith. In, I think, a misguided effort to protect the Orthodox Russian Church, this law has been proposed. I said very frankly and very bluntly--and may I say Congressman Clement from Tennessee, Congressman Dingell from Michigan, and a number of other Members of the U.S. Congress were present during this bilateral meeting and echoed my sentiments--that this law proposed, passed by the Duma, now pending before President Yeltsin, is antithetical to and irreconcilable with a true concept of liberty and religious freedom. 
Among the provisions in this bill that are most alarming is the requirement that religious groups list all of their numbers, their names, their addresses, a requirement that a commission be established--a commission of state experts--to review the doctrines and practices of groups applying for registration. It is unimaginable in this country, in which we have so enshrined the concept of religious freedom. There is a requirement under this bill that a religious group be in existence for 50 years in order to receive `all Russian' status, creating a division between religious associations and groups which could create a multitier religious hierarchy of different denominations. And then in this bill is a requirement that would deny for a 15-year period legal status to new religious groups, which could include those groups that refused to register under the Communist regime. Without legal status, these religious groups could not rent public space for services, they would find it difficult to conduct any financial activity, invite foreigners to Russia, or set up a church school for children. 
There is no justifiable reason to divide religious organizations into two categories, one with full rights and privileges and the others with limited rights, limited privileges. This new Russian law discriminates against religious faiths by establishing a hierarchy of religious groups under the law and denying legal status to communities of believers. 
When similar legislation threatened religious freedom in Russia only 4 years ago, Members of the House, Members of this body, the Senate, joined together in an urgent appeal to Boris Yeltsin to veto that legislation. Courageously, President Yeltsin stood firm. He refused to sign that bill into law. 
Now we have an opportunity, thanks to the amendment of Senator Smith of Oregon, to send a strong message to Russia that we will take concerted action to preserve this essential human right. This is potentially the greatest retreat on religious freedom and human rights since the fall of the Soviet Union, and it is an ominous sign about the future of that Republic. We must forcefully signal our grave concern by passing the Smith amendment. I hope my colleagues in the U.S. Senate will join with Senator Smith of Oregon in sending that signal to the Government of Russia, and add encouragement and solidarity with the people of the Russian Republic. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for his leadership on this issue and for yielding his time. 
I rise today in strong opposition to the Murray amendment. During the Reagan and Bush administrations, abortions were prohibited at overseas Department of Defense medical treatment facilities, except in the cases of rape, incest, or if the mother's life should be in danger. In 1993, just 2 days after taking office, President Clinton issued an Executive order to the Secretary of Defense that reversed this previous ban on abortions, which had been supported, which was reflective of our national priorities and our national policy of not using taxpayers' funds to provide abortions. 
So the President, President Clinton, issued that Executive order reversing the previous ban. This attempt to legislate by Executive order was soon met with fierce resistance, not only by Members of Congress who were greatly concerned about this reversal of position, but by the military's own doctors. 
After the administration's reversal, there were a number of articles that appeared, but two specifically from major media outlets challenging the President's Executive order. `The Pentagon confirmed, all 44 military doctors in Europe have decided against doing the procedure on moral and religious grounds.' I think that is a tribute to our military doctors and a reflection of their own moral concerns about this practice and their support for the traditional position that had been in place for many years. 
Additionally, one Air Force commander stated that all 10 obstetricians under his command expressed an `unwillingness on a personal or moral basis' to perform abortions and, furthermore, that he was not surprised at the doctors' response. 
Military treatment centers--which are, always have been, and should be dedicated to healing and nurturing life--should not be forced to facilitate the taking of the most innocent of human life: the child in the womb. 
We have a policy that has worked. It is a policy that is supported by our military doctors. It is a policy that is reflective of the position that we have held as a Nation, even during this era in which Roe versus Wade has sustained a woman's right to choose abortion--that policy that we will not ask Americans who morally and religiously object to the practice of abortion to subsidize that practice with their tax dollars. This is a law that has worked; it is a law that is effective. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing the Murray amendment and sustaining our existing policy and existing law, consistent with what we as a Nation have held and what our current policy is. I thank the Senator from Indiana. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I also want to commend Senator Roth. The $500 per child tax credit is truly the heart of this tax relief bill. I especially want to thank Senator Gramm for taking the lead in solving this problem, which is a very serious problem. 
There are 382,000 families in Arkansas who benefit from the $500 per child tax credit, but there are many teenaged children who are excluded because of the provision that is in the Finance Committee's bill. I believe parents should have the right to decide. They are better arbiters, they are better decisionmakers on the use of that money than bureaucrats and even lawmakers in Washington, DC. And no matter how good educational savings for teenagers may be, it is better to let the parents make that decision. 
I think I will have a hard time explaining to those parents of that 13-year-old why, when their child was 12 he was eligible or she was eligible for the $500 per child tax credit, but at the age of 13 they are not. Perhaps that 13-year-old will have an emergency. Perhaps that 13-year-old needs braces. Perhaps that 13-year-old needs a math tutor to enable that child to ensure that he or she is ready to go to college when they graduate from high school. The parents will not have the option, will not have the opportunity, will not have the eligibility under the current bill. That is why this amendment is so important that we ensure that the parents have the ultimate decisionmaking authority. 
Forty percent of young people who graduate from high school do not go straight on to college. They should not be excluded from the benefits of this tax bill. Parents should decide, not Washington, DC. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the House of Representatives votes tomorrow on whether or not to extend most-favored-nation trade status to China. In a more desirable world, revoking China's MFN status might be less advisable than handling national security and human rights as well as economic issues in more traditional ways. Unfortunately, the experience of the last 3 or 4 years, in fact experience going back much farther than that, has demonstrated that the administration's policy of constructive engagement has failed. The constructive engagement policy has in fact degenerated. We have seen conditions in China worsened annually. 
The logic behind constructive engagement is, indeed, appealing. It goes something like this. If we will expand trade with China, the result will inevitably be political liberalization and ultimately an improvement in the conditions of the Chinese people, there will be an expansion of human rights opportunities, there will be less repression, there will be less religious persecution, there will be a warmer and more cordial relationship between China and the United States. 
When I was first confronted with the issue of MFN upon my election to Congress in 1993, I was almost persuaded by that logic. In fact, I wanted to be persuaded by that logic, and I was looking for any indication that the policy of constructive engagement was, in fact, having the desired results and that, in fact, conditions were improving, treatment of the Chinese people had improved, there was less repression, and that trade, expanded trade, was in fact having that kind of result. Had there been any sign in the last 4 years that this policy of constructive engagement was having the intended result, I would be voting for MFN this year. Were I given the opportunity, I would be supporting most-favored-nation trade status for China. 
But the facts are very clear and the State Department's own report makes it abundantly clear that conditions have deteriorated, that the policy of linkage has not had the result that we all wanted it to have. So it is argued that economic freedom frequently leads to political freedom, and in fact it does frequently lead to political freedom. There are examples in which that has happened. But in China's case, market economics has become nothing but an utilitarian exercise to ensure the continuation of a totalitarian regime. They have seen if they keep the iron grip upon the Chinese people, that a market economy will help them accomplish that; that expanded trade, higher incomes, economic opportunities for Chinese people--that makes it easier for them to maintain an absolute repression of any kind of free expression within China. 
Proponents of MFN say we all have the same goal, expanded human rights, we just have a different approach on how we best attain that. Russia is often pointed to, the old Soviet Union, where there was a little hole in the dike called perestroika and from that little hole in the dike the floodgates opened and freedom could not be contained. But in China, perhaps they learned the lesson from the Russian experiment or from the Soviet Union's experience, for in China there has been no perestroika; there has been only repression. 
There are, I believe, many flaws in the policy of constructive engagement. First and foremost, it has simply not improved the status of the Chinese people; it has worsened it. The administration's decision not to consider human rights abuses when granting MFN status has proven disastrous for the people of China. As they have been removed from the threat of any repercussions in the trade relationship with the United States, the Chinese Communist leaders have succeeded in jailing or executing every last dissident in a country of over 1 billion people, according to the State Department's own 1996 China report. As we have turned a blind eye, the atrocities have escalated and the oppressive government has strengthened its hold on a full one-fifth of the world's population. The constructive engagement policy has produced more persecutions of Christians, more forced abortions, more sterilizations of the mentally handicapped, more incarcerations of political dissidents, and the near extinction of the expression of any opinions contrary to those of the Communist regime. 
I have on this chart, I think, a very clear illustration of the failure of the constructive engagement policy. On the left of this chart we see a dramatic increase of trade with China, a less dramatic increase of imports from the United States, and a very dramatic increase in exports. We see, in a very graphic manner, while trade has increased from 1987 to 1996, we have also seen that human rights abuses in China have increased almost in a parallel manner. Homeless children--in 1993 over 600,000, in 1997 almost three times as many homeless children, homeless children being the result of those who are incarcerated and those who are executed. Religious persecution in China--in 1993, 2.4 million believers, those people of faith persecuted. In 1997, 4 years later, under the policy of 
constructive engagement, 4.5 million, almost doubling. 
So, while trade increased--the logic of constructive engagement would say trade increasing, more trade opportunities will mean greater human rights and fewer abuses in China. Just the opposite has occurred. 
Reeducation camps--in 1993, 200,000 were in these forced reeducation labor camps; in 1997, over 5 million have been detained, according to Amnesty International and according to the Congressional Research Service. I believe this in fact demonstrates that constructive engagement has been very destructive. 
Second, this delinkage has also resulted in a loss of leverage with the Chinese Government. I want to pause to read from an editorial that appeared in my hometown paper today, the Arkansas Democrat Gazette. It says:  
But they may not realize that a carrot-and-stick approach isn't likely to be effective if the carrot is always offered and the stick is always withheld. 
That has been the result of this delinkage policy. They would say, and they do say: Your words are empty because there is nothing to back them up. Delinkage has not worked because, in effect, there has been no stick. So, is it any wonder that, in effect, we hear the Chinese Government say we don't care what you say because in the end we get what we want and we can continue to do what we please? Mr. President, that delinkage has resulted in a loss of leverage is clearly evident in that State Department report of 1996, in which they said, `No dissidents were known to be active at the year's end.' 
When most-favored-nation status reaches the point that it is no longer conditioned, then it becomes absolutely meaningless. When we look at China and our own State Department says by every measure conditions are worse, yet we say we are still going to extend most-favored-nation trade status, then that annual exercise becomes nothing more than an annual joke that we play in Congress, where we go through the process, we go through the debate, all the time knowing most-favored-nation trade status will be extended, MFN will be extended regardless of what conditions may have occurred within China. 
In a flagrant act of intimidation, China effectively blockaded Taiwan during a missile testing exercise off its coast in March of 1996. Many examples could be given of where the Chinese Government acts with impunity toward our Nation because our policy has been one of coddling. 
Third, constructive engagement supposes a true free enterprise system in China and that system just does not exist. The logic behind constructive engagement is flawed because it assumes that in fact they have a free enterprise system. They do not have that. They have protectionist trade policies, they have an enormous trade deficit with the United States, and the People's Liberation Army controls many of the industries in China. So the assumption is wrong and the policy is flawed. 
Fourth, constructive engagement supposes a fair trade relationship that does not exist. How can you have a fair trade relationship when there are 5 million people in slave labor camps? Forced reeducation camps, the old gulag in the Soviet Union, the concentration camps, that's what they are, with prison industries. Though it is against the law, there is no way that we can totally detect what products are made in prison factories and what products are not. So there is no fair trade relationship with China. 
Then, fifth, constructive engagement ignores the military buildup in China. If you reject everything else, the fact is we have a compelling national security interest as we see China's defense budget growing. United States Ambassador to China James Sasser recently stated that fact. The Chinese themselves have announced an increase in that budget, which will bring total defense outlays to $10 billion and many believe it is closer to $40 billion. So I say, as you look at China's military buildup, their willingness to export weapon components, chemical weapon components, selling those weapon components to Iran, nuclear weapon technology to Pakistan, advanced jet aircraft to Russia and on and on, it is clear that our national security interest would say we ought not extend again most-favored-nation status to China. 
Sixth, constructive engagement is flawed because it assumes that gentle treatment will elicit good behavior while firmness will result in escalating tensions. Let me say that again. The assumption is that if we will give to China gentle treatment, it will elicit good behavior, but that if we dare to take a firm stand, it will escalate tensions. In an earlier day that philosophy was called appeasement, and it has never worked. It did not work in the days of Chamberlain, and it will not work in our day. There is no greater example of it, perhaps, or image of it, at least, than when Vice President Gore toasted Premier Li Peng. 
Arthur Waldron wrote in his essay `How Not to Deal with China,' he said: 
China is involved in disputes around the full circumference of its border, disputes which, like burners on a stove, Beijing may turn up or down, but never turns off. 
So they toy as we grant MFN. The logic behind this policy is flawed. I believe it deserves a vote of no confidence. I hope the Senate will have the opportunity to cast that vote. China has created a dichotomy. They say, on the one hand, give us trade. They say give us sales. They say give us dollars. And on the other hand, they practice political repression, slave labor, forced abortion and religious persecution. Between those two statements there is the great wall of China: Yes, market economy, free trade, but political repression and slave labor. To the extent that free markets lead to free minds, China, in recognizing that, built a wall between. And, as we continue to grant most-favored-nation status, we allow that wall to exist. 
Mr. President, 2 years ago, I was present, as many of my colleagues were, at the dedication of the Korean War Veterans Memorial, the latest war memorial on the Mall in Washington, DC. At the edge of the memorial is a low wall upon which is inscribed this reminder, I think a good reminder for all Senators, a good reminder for all our colleagues in the House of Representatives on this eve of the MFN vote. On that memorial is inscribed these words: `Freedom is not free.' 
To those who would say that profits are the ultimate arbiter of American policy, I say it is time that, once again, values and principles be the determinant of what our national policy is and what our trade policy should be. Freedom is not free. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I rise in opposition to extending most-favored-nation status to China. I was deeply, deeply dismayed at the recent revelation that a State Department report on religious persecution in China and human rights conditions in China, originally scheduled for release back in January, was postponed, originally until June, and then it was announced that it would again be delayed and postponed until after the vote on most-favored-nation status, that vote that would take place now in the House next week. 
I think it is unconscionable, when we consider the seriousness and the import of this vote, for a report from the State Department that has relevant and pertinent information regarding what is going on in China today in regard to human rights and in regard to religious persecution, that that report should not be made available to the American public and to Members of the House of Representatives and to the U.S. Senate prior to our vote on MFN. 
Yesterday, I wrote the President and Secretary of State Albright, asking them for an immediate release of that State Department report so that Members of the House who are yet undecided on how they are going to vote on MFN will have that very important report at their disposal.

<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. I think to postpone the release of that report indicates that the likelihood that conditions in China have improved over the course of the last year are remote. 
The last State Department report, the China country report issued in 1996, was a blistering condemnation of the Chinese Government's repression of their own people and the new wave of the religious persecution that has spread across the country inflicted by this current regime: 
The administration continues to coddle China despite its continuing crackdown on democratic reform, its brutal subjugation of Tibet, its irresponsibility in nuclear missile technology. 
Mr. President, those are not my words. Those were the words of then Candidate Bill Clinton in a speech to Georgetown University in December 1991. Then Candidate Clinton was exactly right, and those very words are equally applicable to the policy of appeasement that has been promoted by the Clinton administration. 
President Clinton, then Candidate Clinton, went on a few months later in March 1992 and said: 
I don't believe we should extend most favored nation status to China unless they make significant progress in human rights, arms proliferation and fair trade. 
He was right then. He is wrong now. They have not made significant progress in any of those categories, human rights, arms proliferation or fair trade. 
And then in August 1992, then Candidate Clinton said: 
We will link China's trading privileges to its human rights records and its conduct of trade weapon sales. 
Of course, we all know that that strong position taken as a candidate was repudiated after he was elected President. What a difference an election makes. 
So today, Mr. President, I called for the immediate release of this State Department report so that an intelligent and informed decision can be made by this Congress when they vote in the House and, hopefully, when a vote yet in the future, in the coming weeks, in the Senate takes place. 
I believe that the change that occurred by this administration was ill-advised and has led to both a failed and flawed policy toward China. 
Not long ago, in the last hour, I had a conversation with former Secretary of State Eagleburger, who is an advocate of most-favored-nation status, favors extending that trading status to China once again. I said, `Things are worse in China since we adopted this constructive engagement policy.' He said, `In what regards?' And I said, `In every regard.' Whether it is human rights, whether it is religious persecution, whether it is military expansionism or the export of weapons of mass destruction, you name the measure, you name the standard, and conditions and situations in China are worse today than they were when we adopted this policy of so-called constructive engagement. 
One might argue that denial of most-favored-nation status is a blunt instrument and is not the best way to achieve our goals, as Senator Thomas argued a few moments ago. One might argue that. One might argue that we should look at other options, that we should seek other tools, other instruments to convey this message to the Chinese Government. But few, I believe, can stand and say that the current policy of this administration has been anything other than an abject failure. 
Some will say that it will be worse if we deny MFN. A person can argue that, but you cannot prove that. What can be demonstrated in all these now many years of MFN is that, rather than responding by expanding trade opportunities and trade relationships with the United States, rather than responding by improving the conditions of the Chinese people, they have responded by a new wave, an unprecedented wave, of repression upon those who would dare to express their own political opinion or their own religious faith. 
The logic behind the administration's policy of engagement is, No. 1, that it will improve conditions in China. It clearly has not. According to the State Department report, this administration's own report, it has not improved conditions. They have become more deplorable. 
Then the administration argues that if we link human rights conditions in China with trade, the result will be that China will be isolated and the United States companies will lose markets and trade opportunities. I think that is interesting. In fact, Bill Clinton, in November 1993, said, `Well, I think, first of all, I think anybody should be reluctant to isolate a country as big as China with the potential China has for good, not only for the 1.2 billion people of China who are enjoying unprecedented and economic growth, but good in the region and good throughout the world. So our reluctance to isolate them is the right reluctance.' 
So this administration argues that if we link what is going on within China to our trade opportunities with this Nation, this vast nation, that we will isolate them, and that American companies will lose this opportunity for this huge bargain. 
Now, how do they argue that? They say that other countries, European countries, for instance, will rush in and fill the vacuum that is left when we pull out. They are probably right. But there is a non sequitur, there is a self-contradiction, in the argument of the administration that we somehow will isolate China and at the same time the other nations will come in and take the trade opportunities that otherwise would be afforded to our companies. 
The fact is, and everyone knows it, that less than 2 percent of our world trade goes to China. Being removed from China will in no way isolate this great vast nation. In fact, it is impossible for us, today, to isolate China. There will be other nations who go in, just as we will find other markets for our products. 
But what is just as certain is that denying the privilege of MFN to this Nation, which is so repressive toward its own people and so expansionist in their military policy, by denying MFN, we can send a powerful and meaningful message to the tyrants in Beijing. I know of no other way that we can send that powerful message, and those who favor the extension of MFN, to me, have not yet offered a significant and meaningful alternative. 
Now, let me just return to my call for the administration to release this report. I think it is absolutely critical that the House of Representatives have before them that report before they are asked to cast this very important vote next week. The coming MFN vote is not just a vote on trade, Mr. President. It is not just a vote on what we stand for as a nation, though it is very much that kind of a vote. Are we going to stand for anything? Are we still going to represent the last best hope for freedom-loving people in this world, or are we not? 
But it is not just a vote on that. It is not just a vote on Chinese military expansionism, though if we have a great national security threat in the decades to come, it will be from China, and it is a vote as to our concern about that expansionism. It is not just a vote on religious persecution in China, though that ought to concern every freedom-loving American. But, Mr. President, it is also a vote on this administration's China policy, a policy that is, I believe, by every measure, flawed and failed. 
Mr. President, I believe this administration deserves a vote of no confidence on their China policy. That can best be given by a no vote on extending MFN to China. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as the House of Representatives begins the process of MFN disapproval today, I rise to once again voice my own strong opposition to the administration's proposed renewal of most favored nation status to China. The United States Ambassador to China, James Sasser, has recently stated--and of course Ambassador Sasser is a proponent, as a member of the administration, and he has favored MFN--but Ambassador Sasser said China's defense budget is growing. The Chinese themselves have announced an increase in that budget which will bring total defense outlays next year to $10 billion and he says some suggest the amount is really closer to $40 billion. 
So there is nothing at all theoretical about China's military buildup. Even the administration, even those who are saying we should continue most-favored-nation status trading status for China, will admit that there is a dramatic and drastic buildup of military capability in China. 
Here is what we know about the Chinese military and its potential, based on the United States Government's own official estimates. The 1997 report by the Office of Naval Intelligence, entitled `Worldwide Challenges to Naval Strike Warfare 1997,' is devoted almost entirely to rapid increases in Chinese capabilities with Iraq, North Korea, and Libyan capabilities covered almost as an afterthought. China, it informs us `is working on the development of at least six new tactical aircraft at a time when most nations are finding it difficult to finance even one.' It continues, `Overall, the Chinese hope to `leap' generations of technology with large investments in new air defense capability.' 
Mr. President, from Beijing, the words of China's military planners themselves, such as this analysis from a paper prepared for senior Chinese officials titled `Can the Chinese Army Win the Next War?' `While the conflict of strategic interests between China and the United States was overshadowed for a time by the tripartite great power relationship, it is now surfacing steadily since the breakup of the Soviet Union. China and the United States, focused on their respective economic and political interests in the Asia-Pacific region, will remain in a sustained state of confrontation.' 
That is coming from the Chinese Government, predicting a sustained state of confrontation. The evidence concerning a Chinese military buildup is clear, it is crystal clear. Whether this evidence comes straight from the administration that would renew MFN to China or from Beijing, how can we reward this regime with a most-favored-nation status? Many who regard themselves as free traders and who argue against linkage of trade through human rights or any other domestic circumstance would admit that when our own national security is involved, when national security is raised to an issue, then trading is a legitimate leverage and a legitimate tool for us to use as a Nation. 
So apart from the abysmal human rights record, apart from the deplorable human rights conditions in China today, apart from the fact that human rights conditions in China have deteriorated over the last 5 years, in spite of all of that, we could look alone at the military buildup in China today and justify denial of most-favored-nation status for China. 
I believe that China's chemical and nuclear exports are the most serious proliferation threat in the world today, and China has held that title at least for the past decade and a half. Since 1980, China has supplied billions of dollars worth of nuclear and missile technology to South Asia, South Africa, South America, and the Middle East. China has done so, Mr. President, in the teeth of United States protests and despite repeated promises that they would stop. 
The chemical and nuclear exports continue, and while they do, they make it impossible for the United States and the West to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction, a trend that endangers everyone. 
Mr. President, China has been the leading proliferator of nuclear weapons in the world. China gave Pakistan nearly everything it needed to make its first atomic bomb. In the early 1980's, China gave Pakistan a tested nuclear weapon design and enough high-enriched uranium to fuel it. Mr. President, this has to be one of the most egregious acts of nuclear proliferation in history. Then China helped Pakistan produce high-enriched uranium with gas centrifuges. Now, Mr. President, China is helping Pakistan build a reactor to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, and helping Pakistan increase the number of its centrifuges so it can boost its production of high-enriched uranium. 
If we grant MFN trading to China, we tacitly endorse the weapons of mass destruction, we support our enemies in their own military buildup, and last Mr. President we set a poor example as the leader of the free world. 
This administration continues to forgive and to forget China for the abuse, the persecution, and the military buildup that it is continuing to employ. There is no reason to think that China's nuclear and chemical export patterns will change. I know the Presiding Officer is well aware of those trends and those practices in China today, but there is no evidence that those patterns will change as long as the United States follows its current policy of MFN trade status for China. China is now saying explicitly that it will not even talk to us about missile and chemical proliferation. 
As I have stated before, Mr. President, on this floor, there must be some things more important than expanded trade opportunities, some things more important than the almighty dollar. Today, as the House begins the process of marking up most-favored-nation status disapproval resolution, I think it is the time for this institution to say we will not continue business as usual with China. The administration's lobbying efforts to grant MFN trading status to China will most assuredly intensify in coming days. We as a country and we as an institution must set an example for the world to follow. If we grant this regime MFN, we set, I think, a continued example only of appeasement. 
Mr. President, I want to make one last point. The repressive Chinese Communist regime has established a blood-stained record of discrimination, detention, and death. The reeducation through labor camps are really no different at all from the old concentration camps or the gulag. But people seem to know less, they seem to care less, in the case of China. Let this institution show that it, in fact, knows, and it, in fact, cares. 
In my closing remarks I quote from an editorial that appeared in my hometown newspaper in Bentonville, AR, last week. The closing words of the editorial said this: `Every time you buy a product labeled Made in China, send up a prayer for Chinese Christians who must live each and every day in fear that their long-suffering faith will cost them their families and their lives.' 
Mr. President, I suggest it is past time that we stood as a Nation against the intolerable human rights record of the nation of China. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today, to join with my friend and colleague Senator Joseph Lieberman, in submitting a bill that will give appropriate and well-deserved recognition to a group of World War II veterans who were held as German political prisoners at the Nazi concentration camp, Buchenwald. Fittingly, today is Shavout in the Jewish religion. This holiday commemorates the Jews receiving the Torah on Mount Sinai and celebrates their fleeing from Egypt. 
First and foremost, I want to thank the original cosponsors of this bill: Senators Helms, Faircloth, Torri- celli, Reid of Nevada, Smith of New Hampshire, Santorum, Hagel, Craig, Mack, Kohl, Murkowski, and Ashcroft. 
Mr. President, Congressmen Dave Weldon and Peter Deutsch will be introducing similar legislation later today in the House of Representatives. 
These brave airmen were different from other Allied prisoners, because they were held at Buchenwald, a Nazi concentration camp--and therefore not subject to the protections of the Geneva Convention. 
The Nazi concentration camps will forever occupy an ignominious place in our human history, and we have long recognized the bravery and daring of many prisoners who fought their Nazi oppressors and struggled to win political and religious freedom. 
Tragically, Mr. President, the United States has never formally recognized the service, sacrifice, and bravery of these American airmen while they were held as political prisoners at the Buchenwald concentration camp.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, of the 82 American airmen, there are three from my home State of Arkansas: Mr. William Powell of Bella Vista, Mr. Frank Cowan of Harrison, and Mr. Robert Ward of Springdale. 
Before I yield the floor, Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to share the response of two of those Arkansans when they learned that this resolution was being introduced today. 
Mr. William Powell said: 
The recognition is long overdue. For decades, the Department of Defense and the International Red Cross have stated that there were no military personnel in Buchenwald. Yet as someone who was imprisoned there for 4 months I know of at least 55 other American soldiers who endured the hardships of this camp. Two men even lost lives there. And nearly all suffered diseases later in life because of the treatment they received while held in Buchenwald. 
In the late 70s, early 80s, I joined with the other survivors of Buchenwald to push this government to recognize our service. We never wanted any money, we just wanted the United States Government to say, Yes, you were there, and we appreciate what you went through for our country. 
I will quote from Mr. Frank Cowan: 
It has been a long time coming, but finally our sacrifice will be acknowledged. Unfortunately, many of those who were at Buchenwald have passed on, nevertheless, there are many of us still alive to enjoy this. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues today to join us in support of this important measure so those veterans still living, and the families and friends of those who have passed on, can fully realize the public recognition these brave men so surely deserve.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to the administration's proposal to renew most-favored-nation status for China, and I rise as an original cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 31, the resolution of disapproval of MFN. 
First and foremost, I want to recognize my good friend and colleague from North Carolina, Senator Jesse Helms. Over the years, Senator Helms has dedicated himself to making this body and the American people aware of China's human rights record of abuse. I sincerely thank the Senator and his staff for their leadership on this very important issue. 
Mr. President, yesterday, June 4, 1997, was the eighth anniversary of the violence in Tiananmen Square. It has now been 8 years since the suppression of prodemocracy protests in China; 8 years since the killing of hundreds of unarmed civilians by the army in Beijing. In 1989, we all watched with amazement as these courageous Chinese students marched in Tiananmen Square. Today, they are all gone. 
During their struggle, they defied the tanks, they looked to the United States for inspiration, they quoted our Declaration of Independence and, through it all, Mr. President, United States policymakers have responded that economic engagement would stop China's abuses of human rights. As far as I can tell, it is, in fact, profit projections that are primarily driving our 
foreign policy. 
How can the United States consider renewing MFN for China when the Chinese authorities still have taken no steps to publicly investigate the circumstances of the killings and bring to justice those found responsible for human rights violations? Instead, the families of victims and people attempting to gather information about those killed are themselves subjected to harassment and intimidation in a continuing attempt by authorities to conceal the facts of what occurred 8 years ago. 
The Chinese Government defines the 1989 protest as a `counterrevolutionary riot.' I believe this definition has been used since 1989 to justify the imprisonment of many people who are the victims of human rights violations. Thousands of political prisoners--thousands--arrested during the crackdown, including prisoners of conscience, are believed to be imprisoned today. How can this Congress accept the administration's proposal to renew MFN for China? How can we stand here in good faith and look the other way? By turning a blind eye to this oppression in the interest of trade opportunities, I believe the United States is sending a clear and unmistakable message. It is the wrong message. The message to the Government of China is one of commendation rather than one of condemnation. 
It has been almost 3 years since the United States formally delinked American trade with China for its human rights performance of abuse. So I say to my colleagues, much has changed in China in the last 3 years, but the changes that have occurred in China have not been changes for the better. We now see a human rights situation in China that is worse by every measure--persecution of Christians, forced abortions, sterilizations of the mentally handicapped, kangaroo courts for Democratic dissenters, incarceration of political dissidents, and, Mr. President, the near extinction of the expression of any opinion contrary to that of the Communist regime. 
I am deeply concerned with the mounting campaign of religious persecutions waged by the rulers of China. Regarding China's deprivation of fundamental human rights and religious aspirations, continuing MFN to China is effectively equivalent to a policy of appeasement. 
The Roman Catholic Church has been made, for all practical purposes, illegal in China. Priests, bishops, and people of faith have been imprisoned and harassed. For example, Zheng Yunsu, the leader of a Jesus family, a Protestant community in Shadong Province, is one of many people who are behind bars simply for practicing their faith. He was arrested during a police raid on the community in 1992. He was later sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for disrupting public order and `swindling.' His four sons and other members of the group were also imprisoned. I believe that they are all prisoners of conscience. 
Mr. President, such persecutions of religious groups has followed a substantial religious revival in China over the past 15 years. In the Christian community, much of the expansion has been in religious groups that conduct their activities outside the Protestant and Catholic churches still recognized by the government, though they are greatly restricted. 
Many peaceful but unregistered religious gatherings have been raided by police, and those attending those services have been beaten, threatened, or detained, and many of those detained are required to pay heavy fines as a condition for their release. Those regarded as leaders are usually kept in custody and either sentenced to prison terms or administratively detained without charge, without trial. And this, Mr. President, is the regime to whom we would grant most-favored-nation status. 
In January 1994, two national regulations on religious activities came into force. Notably, Mr. President, they banned religious activities which undermine national unity and social stability. Under the broad rubric of these two regulations, any activity could be construed as undermining the Chinese Government and, therefore, constitute a threat punishable by arrest, prosecution, imprisonment and bodily harm. 
These regulations also require that all places of religious activities be registered with the authorities according to rules formulated by China's Religious Affairs Bureau, an innocuous-sounding agency. This means, in effect, that religious groups that do not have official approval may not obtain registration and that those involved in religious activities in unregistered places may be detained and punished. Provided in these new regulations are detention and criminal penalties for any violation. And this is the regime to whom we would grant normal trade relations and most-favored-nation status. 
During this past year, police raids on religious gatherings organized by independent groups have continued, with hundreds of Protestants and Catholics reportedly detained as a result. More than 300 Christians were reported to have been detained in what appears to be a crackdown by police on unregistered Protestant houses and churches. And this is the Government to whom we want to extend MFN. 
I believe there is evidence of an intensified Chinese repression of religious liberty. This repression ranges from ransacking homes in Tibet in search of banned pictures of the Dalai Lama to destroying or closing 18,000 Buddhist shrines last spring. Ministers, priests and monks are routinely arrested, imprisoned, tortured and sometimes killed for the mere expression of their faith. For example, let's take the case of Pastor Wong, who runs 40 evangelical churches. He was released in December after a fourth arrest for spreading the Gospel. This time, Mr. President, the government captors broke several of his fingers with pliers. This is the government to whom we would like to extend, again, MFN. 
I believe it is the obligation of the American Government to uphold the principles of democracy and freedom that we claim to espouse. By renewing MFN status to China, we are turning a blind eye to the oppressed in the interest of expanded trade opportunities. There must be some things that are even more important than the almighty dollar. 
Mr. President, in Paul Marshall's critically acclaimed book, `Their Blood Cries Out,' an authoritative book of religious persecutions around the globe, the case of Bishop Su is documented. During Bishop Su's 15 years in China's prison system, he was subjected to various forms of torture. One beating was so severe that the instrument of the beating actually splintered. Then the police ripped apart a wooden door frame and used it to continue the beating until it, too, disintegrated into splinters. The bishop was then hung by his wrists from a ceiling and beaten around the head. 
As appalling as this story is, in another encounter, this bishop was placed in a cell containing water at varying levels from ankle to hip deep where he was left for days unable to sit and unable to sleep. And, again, this is the regime to whom we would give most-favored-nation status. 
Every year, countless numbers of people are detained without charge in breach of the law or sentenced without trial to years of reeducation through labor at the discretion of police and local officials. For those who are charged, sentences are frequently imposed after unfair trials, with the verdict decided beforehand. In many cases, such verdicts even carry the death penalty. 
The Chinese legal system, like, I suppose, all legal systems, supports the established political and governmental institutions. However, it does not do so in a way that is consistent with the rule of law and fundamental human rights. The rule of law becomes subordinate to higher political goals, including the defeat of perceived political enemies within the nation of China. 
The vagueness and contradictory provisions of the law in China lead consistently to Chinese arbitrary enforcement and provides an open invitation to abuse of power. Repressive criminal legislation and the extensive system of administrative detention means that virtually anyone can be detained at the whim of individuals who happen to be in a position of power. 
As we discuss MFN for China, a vast array of laws and regulations continues to be used to detain or imprison political opponents or to warn political dissidents against opposition. 
The Chinese say over and over again that there are no political prisoners in China. Such an assertion is absurd on the surface and it flies in the face of overwhelming evidence. 
People are routinely imprisoned because of their political views or beliefs, but are categorized simply as counterrevolutionaries, administrative detainees, or criminals. In January 1995, for instance, a Ministry of Justice official was cited as stating that 2,678 prisoners convicted of counterrevolutionary offenses were currently in jail. I believe, Mr. President, that this figure represents only a fraction of the real number of political prisoners held in China today. 
Furthermore, I believe that this figure excludes many thousands of people who are jailed for political reasons but convicted of other offenses or held under various forms of administrative detention who have not even been charged or tried. 
We all know that grave human rights violations have continued in China since 1995. They range from the arbitrary detention of people who peacefully express their views to gross violations of the physical integrity of the person and their very right to life. Dissent and any activity perceived as a threat to the established political order continues to be repressed. 
So as we debate MFN for China, thousands of political prisoners, including members of religious and ethnic groups, are in jail simply for expressing their views. Torture and ill-treatment continue to be common practices during arrest in police stations, detention centers, labor camps, prisons, and this often results in the death of these victims. 
It is my understanding, Mr. President, that at least a thousand people have been executed in China since the launch of a nationwide anticrime campaign in 1996. I call out to my colleagues that we must put pressure on China to stop these mass executions, many of which are carried out after only show trials. 
The political authorities in China have instructed the judiciary to speed up procedures to sentence offenders, including those liable to the death penalty. And I believe the result is untold miscarriages of justice. 
If we grant MFN to China in view of these practices, then we too are guilty of a miscarriage of justice. If we renew China's MFN status, as the administration wants us to, then I think we are derelict in our duty, this Congress' duty to uphold the principles of dignity and fundamental freedoms. 
If we really want to engage the Chinese, we have to show that we are willing to confront them when they break the rules. We have not done that. And we will not do that by granting them most-favored-nation status. 
For 4 consecutive years, from 1991 to 1995, the Chinese Government has successfully used a procedural motion to block any resolution critical of its human rights record being debated by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. Mr. President, no government should be allowed to choose the extent to which it will abide by international human rights laws. No government should be allowed to manipulate human rights issues to further its political aims. 
Newspapers in early April reported that China has been selling Iran the components of chemical weapons for several years. This was one in an ongoing series of reports about the Chinese military. The Chinese are also said to be dealing in nuclear weapons with Pakistan, buying advanced jet aircraft from Russia, and contracting for Russian-made aircraft carriers equipped with surface-to-surface missiles. 
This is the nation, this is the government, this is the regime that we say, `You deserve again to have most-favored-nation status renewed,' a nation that has a growing military capacity, that is increasing its military defense spending, has an expansionist view of its own territorial goals and has snubbed us at every turn in our seeking conciliation and moderation in their foreign policy? 
It seems while the administration would like Congress to renew MFN to China, they were and are fully aware of China's supplying Iran, Iraq and other enemies of the United States with deadly weapons--conventional, chemical, and nuclear. 
Robert Einhorn, Deputy Secretary of State for Nonproliferation, has recently stated:  
These dual-use, chemical-related transfers to Iran's chemical weapons program indicates that, at minimum, China's chemical export controls are not operating effectively enough to ensure compliance with China's prospective obligation not to assist anyone in any way to acquire chemical weapons. 
Mr. Einhorn has also confirmed reports that China has been providing Iran with advanced C-802 cruise missiles capable of threatening United States warships in the Persian Gulf. Moreover, Mr. President, he testified to a Senate panel that: 
We have information of discussions between Iran and China about additional conventional weapons sales. We expect there will be more. 
That is what our State Department is saying about China's export controls. 
Mr. President, as for still other reports that China has been running a brisk sale of mobile, nuclear-capable M-11 
nuclear components to Pakistan--2 years after it pledged not to do so--Mr. Einhorn said those reports are, in fact, correct. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues, can China, under the current regime, be trusted to honor its treaty obligations? If China, our partner in engagement under the Clinton administration policy of constructive engagement, if China, our partner in engagement, supplies Iran, Iraq, and other enemies of the United States with deadly weapons, what in reality does that make China? 
Mr. President, the biggest question of all in this year's MFN debate should be, is United States trade with China in effect subsidizing a military buildup that will soon threaten not only Taiwan, Japan, and China's other Asian neighbors, but even our own national security? 
Mr. President, militarily, the administration has sought to strengthen Taiwan. We have shipped Patriot missiles to Taiwan, and Taiwanese pilots are at this moment in the United States being trained to use the F-16 jet fighters that America has also pledged to send to our ally. 
When the Chinese in effect blockaded Taiwan during a missile-testing exercise off its coast in March of last year, the President--and I commend him--responded with a firm show of America's force dispatching the Independence in the area. 
I ask, why, even though we deplore the Chinese military buildup in diplomacy and counter it in strategy, do we continue to help to finance it in trade? 
Mr. President, these are some very serious questions that go unanswered by the administration in their attempt to renew MFN to China. I am very concerned with the administration's obvious neglect and disregard for the United States Department of State's `China Country Report on Human Rights' for 1996. Mr. President, the findings are absolutely horrific. I urge my colleagues to listen closely as I read one passage from this report. I quote: 
Overall in 1996, the Chinese authorities stepped up efforts to cut off expressions of protest or criticism. All public dissent against the party and government was effectively silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No dissidents were known to be active at year's end. 
I repeat, `No dissidents were known to be active at year's end.' 
I continue the report: 
Serious human rights abuses persist in minority areas, including Tibet and Inner Mongolia. Controls on religion and other fundamental freedoms in these areas have also intensified. 
This report debunks the logic of engagement. We were told that the situation in China was going to get better. That is what I was told when I first came to Congress in 1993, that if we will grant MFN to China, if we will extend that again, that this policy of engagement would result in better human rights conditions in China. But they have not improved. The situation has only grown worse. 
I am astonished that the administration can justify renewal of MFN status for China, with what is provided in the report: the sale of women, religious persecution, forced abortions, forced sterilizations, continued disappearances of political rivals, et cetera. This important and vital report, overlooked by the administration, clearly states there are no free dissidents left in China today--not one, none. 
I understand the importance of trade. It is important to Arkansas. It is important to America. It is important to our farmers. It is important to our manufacturers. But, Mr. President, I am convinced either the President has not read the State Department's report and/or the administration has ignored its findings. 
Furthermore, China's human rights abuses, as described by the State Department, should be met with a heavy price, not a prize. Granting China special status only perpetuates their illegal and indecent actions toward the Chinese people. 
Some would say, you cannot talk that way about China. Some would say that this will offend China. But then Ronald Reagan had many critics when he called the Soviet Union the `evil empire.' Our goal is not to isolate China, but to awaken China to its inhumanity to its own people. 
Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I just want to make one more plea to my colleagues not to turn a blind eye to the oppressed in the interest of trade opportunities. I urge my colleagues to stand up and voice their opposition to the treatment of the Chinese Government toward their own people. Mr. President, I urge this administration to rethink a narrowminded, nearsighted, and unengaging solution to human rights abuses. 
For 16 years--for 16 years--the United States has extended MFN status to China, and in doing so, we have tacitly endorsed everything from forced abortions to the sale of dangerous weapons to our enemies. 
I was talking to one of my colleagues early this week, and I told him that I have looked for 3 years for some scintilla of evidence that engagement has worked, I would like to vote for 
MFN, but I have not seen any evidence at all that this policy has improved the condition of the Chinese people or improved the human rights situation for those being oppressed in China. His response to me was, `Tim, it takes time.' 
Mr. President, time has run out for the thousands and thousands, who, today, find themselves in prison, and the families who have lost loved ones because of the oppressive regime that rules China. 
The United States must stand for something once again. The debate is about more than dollars and cents. It is about our values as a nation. Others of my colleagues have said, `Well, we can't tell them what to do domestically.' I would simply raise the question that it seems to be that the evidence is mounting daily that they have sought to tell us what to do domestically through influencing American elections. 
Eight years ago, the world looked on in awe and admiration for those thousands of students who stood with courage in Tiananmen Square. Tiananmen Square must not become a haunting but fading memory to the world and to the American people. 
So I ask my colleagues this question: Does not a little part, a little piece of the soul of this Nation die every time we turn away and allow freedom to be extinguished anywhere on this globe? 
Let us make a difference. We must confront China's abuses. The price of not doing so is simply too high.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, it is with a great deal of enthusiasm that I rise to voice support for S. 4, I think the aptly named `Family Friendly Workplace Act.' I think that is exactly what this bill does. It provides some friendliness in the Fair Labor Standards Act for the employees, for the workers in this Nation. 
I want to compliment and commend the Senator from Missouri for his leadership on this issue. I know of no one in this body more committed and more dedicated to the American family than the Senator from Missouri. And he demonstrated that I believe in his sponsorship and his championing of this cause and this bill. 
This bill will give American workers the flexibility to take paid time off for any reason by simply working those hours in advance, paid time off. I know there are many in this body who have worked hard for family and medical leave. That is unpaid family medical leave. Most in the U.S. Senate voted for the Family and Medical Leave Act, the unpaid Family and Medical Leave Act. Therefore, it puzzles me that so many of those who championed family and medical leave on a voluntary and unpaid basis will now oppose this legislation which will provide workers paid time off for any reason by simply working those hours in advance. 
It would make it possible, this bill, for modern families to harmonize the ever-increasing demands of family life and the workplace. Many employers have done their best to try to build some flexibility under the current law. And they have found themselves repeatedly in a virtual straitjacket. 
This legislation will provide them that much-needed flexibility to work with and on behalf of those whom it is their best interest to help, their employees, their own workers. This is an issue which has been recognized by those on both sides of the aisle as being crucial to the future of the American family in this country. Mothers need to be able to leave work early to attend parent-teacher conferences or whatever else may be important to the welfare of their families. Fathers need to be able to take off work early to go coach their children's Little League team or some other worthy activity that will benefit their families.

 Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great patriot who has served over 54 years in the Federal Government. On May 15, 1997, Raymond `Ray' T. Reid, retired from the U.S. House of Representatives, where he worked as a chief of staff for 23 years, lending his expertise and leadership to three different Congressmen representing the Third District of Arkansas. I was one of those fortunate Members who had the privilege of working with Ray for the 4 years that I served in the House. When I was first elected to Congress in 1992, I replaced John Paul Hammerschmidt, a retiring Member who had represented the Third District for 26 years, and had become a legend both on Capitol Hill and in the State of Arkansas. However, it was no secret that behind this great politician was Ray Reid, a man who over the years had become an Arkansas legend himself. When John Paul retired, his work continued on through Ray's service and dedication. As a newly elected freshman, Ray provided my office with continuity, efficiency, stability, and a wisdom that could only come from 19 years of being a chief of staff. 
The successful career of Ray Reid began long before he worked on Capitol Hill. Ray began his career back in 1942 when he left Bowdoin College in Brunswick, ME, to join the U.S. Army to defend our Nation in World War II. Following the war, he rose quickly up the ranks, receiving honors for his leadership ability and outstanding achievement. He made the Army his career for 31 years, where he served on both foreign soil and here in the United States. Ray moved his family several times, living in countries around the globe. He fought for freedom and justice in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam in addition to faithfully serving his country in peacetime. 
He continued his service undiminished until December 31, 1973, when he retired from the Army as a colonel. Having worked in the Office of the Congressional Liaison at the Pentagon, Ray was able to make a smooth, natural transition to working in a congressional office. He brought to Congressman Hammerschmidt's office a vast degree of knowledge from several years of international exposure and a solid background in domestic policy. By the time Ray came to work for me, he was an invaluable resource who possessed a wealth of information and experience. Throughout his tenure as chief of staff in my office, he provided guidance and an institutional knowl- edge which would have been difficult to match. I can say without hesitance that Ray Reid conducted legislative business with the highest ethical standards. The best interests of the residents of the Third District were always placed above partisan politics and our office was managed in a way that was beyond reproach. When I moved over to the Senate, Ray demonstrated his commitment to the constituents of the Third District once again by agreeing to see another freshman, my brother, Asa, through the transition process. 
So, today, as Ray enjoys the first Monday that he doesn't need to go to work after over a half a century of public service, on behalf of the State of Arkansas and the people he touched here on Capitol Hill, I want to offer my deepest thanks to a man whose loyalty and friendship will not be forgotten. Truly a job well done.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for yielding. 
Mr. President, I rise in respectful but very, very strong opposition to the Daschle amendment. 
I want to commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for his courageous leadership on an issue that deserves to be debated and a ban which deserves to be passed. 
I believe that abortion and the human life issue in this country are the great moral issues that confront our society. 
I heard my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, say that we voted 52 times in the last Congress on the issue of abortion. And she said, `Are we any better off?' 
I would suggest that while we debate balanced budget amendments, while we debate chemical weapons treaties, and while we debate a host of important issues, there is no issue more important to the future of our country, to civilization, and to the kind of people we are going to be than the sanctity of human life. If it takes 52 votes, then it is worth it. 
Many of today's politicians will run for cover at the very mention of abortion, even at the term `partial-birth abortion.' How do we call ourselves leaders if we are not willing to grapple, to debate, to struggle, to agonize and reach moral conclusions as to this great issue confronting who we are as a people and what kind of civilization we are going to be. 
I heard over and over the proponents of the Daschle amendment, the opponents of the ban on partial-birth abortions, that it is hard to imagine that we would be debating on the floor of the U.S. Senate with those who would oppose a ban on the most horrific, barbaric procedure imaginable. But that is what we are doing. I heard them over and over say, `Let's keep politicians out of it; shouldn't have politicians getting involved in such an issue'; suggested that Government should stay out of the abortion issue. If the protection of innocent human life is not Government's duty, then what is? 
Thomas Jefferson once wrote, `The care of human life, not its destruction, is the first and only legitimate objective of good government.' Then Jefferson went on. He said, `Legislative efforts to protect the weak and defenseless are right, and should be pursued.' 
Isn't that the proper role of Government--to protect those who are weak, to protect those who are defenseless? Should we not, in Jefferson's words, `pursue' those legislative efforts? I believe we should. 
To me it is the great irony of the Daschle amendment because in every speaker who has advocated and spoken in favor of the Daschle amendment there has been a dichotomy. There has been, `Keep Government out. Oh, this is tough. This is a tough ban. Keep Government out of this. Leave it with the physician. But we will throw that physician in jail. The Daschle abortion ban spares viable fetuses, proposals stricter than the GOP measure. They will throw him in jail, and then, keep Government out.' 
To my colleagues, I say you can't have it both ways. It is clever. It sounds good. The reason we have this amendment today is because the polls say that 70 percent of the American people support a ban on this terrible, terrible medical procedure, if you can call it a medical procedure--partial-birth abortion. 
That is why this amendment is being offered. I hope that after this debate is over, Senator Daschle will offer this as a freestanding bill. I think it has problems. I do not think it will do all what he believes it will do, what I think he sincerely believes it will do, but if he is sincere in this, it will be offered as a freestanding bill, and we will take this up through the legislative process. 
The reason the President has said he will support the Daschle amendment, in my opinion, is simply that he knows it is no ban. It is, in the words of George Will, `a law that can't be violated.' In fact, the ultimate arbiter becomes the physician, in this case the abortion provider. 
Seventy percent of the American people say we need this ban and support it. In March of this year, Arkansas, my home State, joined with seven other States in banning such a procedure. The State legislature passed the bill. Gov. Mike Huckabee signed the bill into law. And I believe that the home State of our President has, in enacting that legislation, in passing our own partial-birth abortion ban in the State of Arkansas, they have sent a message to the President of the United States, our former Governor, our native son, that the people of his home State do not want this procedure legal in this country. 
Partial-birth abortion is barbaric; it is uncivilized; it is shockingly close to infanticide; and no civilized country should allow it. It is that simple. Any woman knows that the first step of a partial-birth abortion--breech delivery--is something to avoid, not something to cause purposely. 
The rhetoric surrounding this issue is amazing. Those who would allow unlimited partial-birth abortions characterize the procedure as one that is used very rarely and only in an absolute emergency and only where no other procedure is available. They would have you believe that all those who have this procedure want to carry their pregnancy to term and have the child. These claims are simply wrong and they are unfounded. A quote that is extremely interesting to me is from Jean Wright, associate professor of Pediatrics at Emory University. Ms. Wright was testifying against the argument that fetuses who are candidates for a partial-birth abortion do not feel pain during the procedure. She testified that the fetus is sensitive to pain, perhaps even more sensitive than a full-term infant. She added, and this is the part that is especially striking, `This procedure, if it was done on an animal in my institution, would not make it through the institutional review process. The animal would be more protected than this child is.' 
It is incredible. We are protecting animals better than we protect unborn, viable fetuses. Making one class of humanity expendable, I believe, devalues all humanity. In fact, the rejection of life's sanctity begins a downward journey toward human debasement. 
I was interviewed, as we all have been interviewed, by a reporter. I was interviewed yesterday, and the reporter asked an interesting question. She asked this: Won't this ban start us down a slippery slope that will end up banning all abortions? Interesting choice of words, `slippery slope,' because now in this country we debate assisted suicides, we debate partial-birth abortions. The slippery slope has been in our slow debasement and devaluing of the worth and sanctity and dignity of human life. That is the slippery slope. 
Over the last few months there has been some breakthrough, I think, in information that is being disseminated. The confession of Ron Fitzsimmons was very telling when he admitted that he `lied through his teeth' to the Nation. I cannot help but wonder after this vote is over if 2 months, 3 months down the road we will not find again that there has been a campaign of disinformation to prevent this ban from being enacted. I even now ask my colleagues to look deep within their souls. They have been misled. They have 
been sold a bill of goods. They have every justification for switching a vote and voting for this ban and voting to override an expected veto.  
In the vast majority of cases, the procedure is performed on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus. 
That is what Ron Fitzsimmons said. That is what he admitted. He is an advocate of abortion. He goes on to say that the abortion-rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so probably, does everyone else. One of the facts of abortion is that women enter the abortion clinics to kill their fetuses. It is a form of killing. You are ending a life. 
That is what the head of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers confessed. Syndicated columnist Richard Cohen admitted he `was led to believe that late-term abortions were extremely rare and performed only when the life of the mother was in danger or the fetus irreparably deformed.' Realizing the mistake, and I quote again, he said, `I was wrong.' 
Wouldn't it be refreshing if some of those who were misled would simply say, `I was wrong. I will change my vote.' 
Could I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania for an additional 5 minutes?

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Now we have the Daschle amendment before us. The facts have not changed. I think many are beginning to see the truth on this issue, the truth behind the partial-birth abortion myth. 
The next myth that we have to overcome in this debate is that the President and his congressional allies have a viable alternative to the partial-birth abortion ban, that this amendment that we are debating even now is a legitimate alternative to a ban on partial-birth abortions. 
Well, that is a myth. George Will said, `It is a law that's impossible to violate.' He is right. It is an amendment that pro-abortion allies can support so they can tell their constituents they supported a ban, I believe. And, again, I hope that this will be introduced as a freestanding bill because I think in that situation, we will be able to see exactly where the flaws are as it is debated in a committee, as it is scrutinized. 
The Daschle proposal would explicitly allow abortion even in the third trimester if an abortionist simply asserts that `continuation of the pregnancy would risk grievous injury to the mother.' That is all he has to say. That's all the abortionist has to say. In effect, the Daschle amendment would allow partial-birth abortions on demand in the fifth and sixth months of the baby's development when the vast majority of such abortions are performed. So the vast majority of partial-birth abortions--this procedure that is universally condemned--would be permitted under the Daschle amendment, it would not affect them at all, would not stop a one, even though we know that many of those preborn infants can now survive even before the third trimester because of advanced technology. 
I recently visited the Children's Hospital in Little Rock, AR. I was absolutely amazed at the neonatal unit and what is being done today in lowering the age of viability. On the basis of recent published interviews with abortionists who perform these procedures as well as the head of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, Ron Fitzsimmons, it appears likely that 90 percent or more of partial-birth abortions are performed in the fifth and sixth months, not the third trimester. The Daschle amendment will not affect those partial-birth abortions at all. 
One of Senator Daschle's arguments against adding second-trimester language is that Roe versus Wade prohibits second-trimester abortions. But in the official report of the House Judiciary Committee on the bill, the committee argues that the partial-birth abortion procedure is not protected by Roe versus 
Wade. It is not protected by Roe versus Wade since the baby is mostly outside the womb throughout the procedure, and Roe versus Wade refers to fetuses inside the womb. 
So to say we cannot address the second-trimester issue of partial-birth abortions because it is protected by Roe versus Wade is to beg the issue and to avoid, I think, good legal opinion. 
Many lawmakers who support Roe versus Wade also support the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, some of them explicitly citing the Judiciary Committee's constitutional argument. In addition, several States have passed bills to ban partial-birth abortions at any point in the pregnancy with only a life-of-the-mother exception. It appears, therefore, that many State legislators do not share the Democratic leader's view that they are powerless to prevent partial-birth abortions in the fifth and sixth months. 
My home State of Arkansas, as I mentioned earlier, is one of those States that does not share in that opinion. 
Moreover, the Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, a coalition of over 500 physicians, including professors and department chairmen in obstetrics and gynecology, has emphasized that not only is a partial-birth abortion never necessary to preserve a woman's health or future fertility, but this procedure can, in fact, pose a significant threat to both. 
While there may be a medical circumstance which requires a fetus to be delivered early, there is none--none--which requires killing the fetus and certainly none requiring that a fetus be partly delivered and then killed as during a partial-birth abortion. 
The Daschle proposal would allow any abortionist to kill a baby even after viability merely by signing a permission slip to himself, a so-called certification, and once the abortion provider signs such a piece of paper, this amendment would give that abortion provider complete immunity from any penalty, even if there is overwhelming objective evidence that he aborted a healthy, viable baby of a mother who is not at risk, because he signed that certification. 
The House passed H.R. 1122, its version, with a margin sufficient to override a Presidential veto. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join our House colleagues in such a vote here. There is nothing, I believe, that will define us as a people, there is nothing that will define us as a civilization more than how we speak on this issue.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, most of the time when I stand on this floor following Senator Wellstone, I will be on the opposite side of Senator Wellstone's comments. This evening, I would like to associate myself with the comments that Senator Wellstone made. I think between the two of us, we pretty well cover the political spectrum as we stand today on the floor of the United States Senate and call for the immediate release of Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent political prisoner. 
Because of his courageous stand as a voice for democracy and human rights, Wei Jingsheng was sentenced in 1979 to 15 years in prison. He served 14 1/2 years of his term and was released in September 1993 as part of China's bid to host the Olympic Games in the year 2000. Wei continued to speak out for human rights and was detained, again, by the Chinese Government less than 6 months after his release. 
Wei Jingsheng was first jailed in 1979 because of his peaceful activities and writings during China's democracy wall movement, notably his famous essay, `The Fifth Modernization--Democracy.' Following his release from prison in September 1993, he met with journalists and diplomats, wrote articles for publications abroad and continued to assert the rights and aspirations of the Chinese people. 
Mr. President, on December 13, 1995, Wei Jingsheng was tried and convicted of the totally unfounded charge of conspiring to subvert the Chinese Government. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison and 3 years deprivation of his political rights. 
Human rights organizations and governments around the world have condemned the trial and severe sentence. We, the Congress, have unanimously adopted resolutions calling for Wei's immediate and unconditional release. The European Parliament has also called for his release, declaring that Wei had been `persecuted because he was demanding democratic rights for Chinese people.' 
Mr. President, it is my understanding that Wei's family has appealed to the United Nations for help, increasingly concerned about his failing health, which has further deteriorated. Though he is no longer in solitary confinement, Wei is under constant surveillance from other inmates while cell lights are on 24 hours a day, visits by his family are restricted, and he has no access to outside medical care. 
Wei Jingsheng remains a symbol of hope in China for those within China who are voiceless. They have steadfastly refused to give up their beliefs, their principles and their commitment to democratic reforms, despite the suffering and punishment that they have endured. 
I believe that by honoring Wei for his courageous commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms, we will draw attention to the ongoing struggle for fundamental human rights in the People's Republic of China at a crucial time in that nation's history. Calling for the immediate release of Wei sends a strong message to China on behalf of the entire international community. 
On Friday of last week, I joined a bipartisan and bicameral effort in honoring Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, along with Mr. Harry Wu, at the third anniversary of the Vietnam Human Rights Day. As I speak today, Dr. Que still remains in prison unable to leave Vietnam to seek medical attention and unable to speak freely about the abuses he has suffered at the hands of the Vietnamese Government. Of course, Mr. Wu, who fought for representative government and human rights in China for many years, was persecuted and held as a prisoner of conscience by China's Communist dictatorship. He was eventually allowed to emigrate to the United States where he has, thankfully, continued his efforts to help the Chinese people gain liberty and human dignity. 
On August 25, 1995, Mr. Wu was expelled from China and returned safely to San Francisco. While this case was notable because Mr. Wu is a naturalized American citizen, the Chinese Government holds many thousands of prisoners who, like Mr. Wu and Wei Jingsheng, are guilty of nothing more than speaking out in 
defense of human liberty. 
While the cases of Mr. Wu, Wei Jingsheng and Dr. Nguyen Dan Que may differ, they are all representative of human rights abuses around the world, and especially by the Chinese Government. 
For too many years, Mr. President, these courageous individuals have been deprived of the opportunity to exercise the right to self-determination concerning fundamental human and political aspirations. I say again, for too many years, they have been denied those rights. 
Furthermore, it has been almost 3 years since the United States formally delinked American trade with China from its human rights performance of abuse. I say to my colleagues that much has changed in China, but it has not changed for the better. We now see a human rights situation that is worse by every measure: persecution of Christians, forced abortions, sterilization of the mentally handicapped and kangaroo courts for democratic dissenters. 
Mr. President, I am deeply concerned with the mounting campaign of religious persecutions waged by the rulers of China. The Roman Catholic Church has effectively been made illegal in China. Priests, bishops, and people of faith have been imprisoned and harassed. 
China's recent moves have menaced Hong Kong, in violation of their agreements with Britain and their assurances to the United States. Forty percent of education and social services in that colony are currently run by church-related agencies. China's action in suspending the Hong Kong Bill of Rights threatens the freedom of speech, the freedom of assembly and the freedom of religion. 
I believe that these arguments will come to a boil again in coming weeks, when this Congress votes once more on most-favored-nation status for China. It is the obligation of the American Government to uphold the principles of democracy and freedom for all peoples. We must not turn a blind eye to the oppressed in the interest of expanded trade opportunities. The idea that expanded trade would somehow result in improved human rights conditions in China has been disproved. It simply has not happened. 
Today's statements calling for the immediate release of Wei Jingsheng heeds hope for those who are victims of oppression. I look forward to the day when all peoples enjoy the countless freedoms that we have in the United States. I salute the efforts of Wei Jingsheng, Mr. Harry Wu, Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, and I urge my colleagues to stand up and voice their opposition to the treatment of these political dissenters and these defenders of liberty and, furthermore, we should stand against all human rights abuses around the world. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced legislation that I believe is desperately needed by millions of uninsured Americans who are employed by small businesses. 
The problem of the uninsured--both children and adults--is largely a problem of small businesses lacking access to affordable health insurance. 
When I first came to Congress in 1993 on the House side, health insurance coverage and accessibility was at the forefront of public debate. This year, it seems as if all of the attention is focused upon health insurance coverage for children--a very important topic indeed. 
If we can provide access for millions of adults in this country, we can extend access to health care for millions of children. We know that there are more than 40 million uninsured Americans, and that 10 million of those 40 million Americans are children. It is these children who are the most vulnerable in our society. If we do not provide these children with quality health care in their early years, we will find the cost of providing health care for them as they grow older to be ever higher. Not providing quality health care for our children translates into higher health costs for all of us. 
A closer examination reveals that 80 percent of these individuals--that is the 40 million who are uninsured--live in families with an employed worker who is likely to work for a small employer, or who is self-employed. That is, they are drawing a paycheck. And, yet, they don't have health insurance. 
In fact, only 26 percent of the workers in companies of 10 employees or less receive health insurance through their employer, while nearly all workers in Fortune 500 companies have health insurance available to them. This, of course, is because many small employers simply cannot afford high health premiums and the high administrative costs associated with health insurance today. 
So, if you work for a small business with 10 employees or less, the odds are three to one that you don't have health insurance. 
If we can solve this problem so that millions of Americans who are working for small businesses can obtain health insurance, we will have taken a huge step toward providing health insurance for all Americans. 
According to a February General Accounting Office study, while many employers remain committed to providing employee and family coverage, the percentage of people with private coverage is declining in America. At the very time that we want to expand health insurance for millions of children in this country, at the very time that we have a goal of providing universal health coverage to all Americans, we are finding that the percentage of people with health coverage is declining. One of the primary reasons for this decline is eroding financial support. Each year between the late 1980's and 1994, increases in employers' cost to provide health insurance to their employees and their employees' families outpaced inflation, with cost growth of 18 percent in one single year. 
With the surge in health insurance premium costs, many employers have reevaluated their commitment to provide health coverage to employees and their families. It is understandable. With health care inflation, increasing at as much as 18 percent a year in certain instances, it is little wonder that employers are reevaluating whether they are going to be able to afford to provide health coverage to their employees and to their employees' families. Some employers--particularly smaller employers--have dropped their health care coverage altogether. Many employers that have chosen to continue to offer benefits, have been forced to raise employees' premiums, creating more out of pocket expenses for their employees--which is essentially a pay cut. 
The percentage of Americans with private health insurance dropped from 75 percent in 1989 to 71 percent in 1995. During the same time period, private health insurance coverage for children under the age of 18 decreased from 73 percent to 66 percent. If private coverage levels had not decreased, it is estimated that about 5 million more children and 5 million more adults would have 
private health insurance. 
To my colleagues, I say that we are actually losing ground in our efforts to provide health insurance for all Americans. 
Small employers also cannot afford costly State mandated benefit requirements, which studies show can add up to 30 percent of health care costs. According to a December 1996 study by Blue Cross-Blue Shield, the number of State mandated benefit requirements has soared over the past 20 years. For example, the State of Florida had enacted only two insurance related mandates in 1976. In just 20 years, the number of State insurance mandates in the State of Florida has increased to 36. In my home State of Arkansas, the number has more than quintupled over the same 20-year period. State mandates are increasing exponentially all over the Nation. 
It is important to realize that while the number of people with private insurance has declined, the number of people with Medicaid coverage has increased. Unless the decline in private coverage abates, taxpayers may face increased costs for health care as we see more and more people enroll in the Medicaid system. 
The Expanded Portability and Health Insurance Coverage Act, which I introduced yesterday, will help alleviate the problem of the uninsured by removing barriers that prevent small businesses from providing health insurance to their employees. Most small businesses want to provide these benefits, but they find that there are innumerable, costly barriers that prevent them from doing so. This legislation will give associations and franchise networks the opportunity to form multistate purchasing groups under a single set of national rules, through the Employment Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA. The EPHIC bill will make health insurance more affordable for small employers in several important ways. 
First, it will lower administrative costs. Second, it will provide greater bargaining power to smaller employers to negotiate better agreements with health plans and providers. Finally, it will eliminate the need for small businesses to comply with costly State-mandated benefit requirements which, as I mentioned, studies indicate amount to 30 percent in additional cost. 
To put this in this perspective, just last week, a constituent came into my office and told me the following story. He is an employer with about 150 employees in Little Rock, AR. He shopped around for health insurance for his employees, and generously agreed to pay 90 percent of their health insurance premiums. Just last year, he was faced with a 25-percent increase in his health care costs--a 25-percent increase. Now, his only choices are to drastically decrease the amount of benefits provided to his employees, or raise the premiums for his employees and the portion they pay, or, as so many small businesses are doing today, drop coverage altogether. 
The EPHIC bill will help millions of employers who, like my constituent in Little Rock, AR, really want to provide health benefits to their employees. 
While expanding insurance coverage to American workers and their families, the EPHIC bill also contains important consumer safeguards that would apply to multigroup plans that self-insure. They include mandatory stop-loss insurance, reserve requirements, solvency indemnification standards, and strict fiduciary responsibilities, and nondiscrimination requirements. 
The EPHIC bill is supported by a broad coalition of over 100 organizations, and has bipartisan support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. There are over 100 cosponsors of this bill in the House of Representatives. 
I am very pleased that Senator Lott, Senator Hollings, Senator Brownback, Senator Roberts, and Senator Landrieu have joined as original cosponsors of this very, very important legislation. 
I urge the rest of my colleagues to join in support of this legislation as well. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I want to commend Senator Stevens for his fair role as gatekeeper. 
I want to particularly commend the Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, and Senator Graham of Florida, for taking their leadership on a very important issue, a true issue of equity and fairness. 
I think it is unfortunate that, in the middle of a very delicate process of reauthorizing the ISTEA legislation, we have to be debating an amendment that only seeks to implement current law. That is all the Warner-Graham amendment does. It implements current law. We are not seeking anything that is unfair to any other State. We are merely looking to ensure a fair allocation of these funds. 
To me it is very frustrating that the Appropriations Committee felt that it had to change current law implemented in 1991 under the ISTEA bill so that we could have this funding arrangement. 
The donor-donee debate will go on. I only want to say that while I recognize all of the arguments, when we talk about fairness, just remember the State of Arkansas where we, like so many other States, have tremendous transportation needs. We are 16th in the Nation in public roads and street length. We are 42d in the Nation in disbursements for these highways. 
While we need a national highway system, that kind of inequity I don't believe can be justified, and it shouldn't be exacerbated by changing this law to hold harmless the donee States. Arkansas has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the Nation. It is coming up, but it is very low. And we right now are paying more into the highway trust fund to benefit those States, most of whom have much higher per capita incomes and no more transportation needs than we have in the State of Arkansas. 
So I believe the effort to change current law in order to hold harmless and in effect create an entirely new funding formula is unfair. 
When ISTEA was passed in 1991, the formula was specifically adjusted for fiscal year 1999 so that States like Arkansas and many other States could have a more equitable funding formula. That 1997 adjustment finally went into the account to correct the inequality that had existed for donor States for many, many years. Even then, it was not perfectly equitable. But it was closer than 
it had been. 
So, when the Appropriations Committee added extra funds to the supplemental appropriations bill, it seemed logical and it seemed reasonable that they would use the fiscal year 1997 formula to distribute the funds. But logic, unfortunately, has not prevailed. They decided they would use the fiscal year 1996 formula so that, in their words, `no State shall receive an amount in fiscal year 1997 that is less than the amount they received in fiscal year 1996.' 
Basically the committee said that, although ISTEA was specifically structured to benefit donor States, those who pay in more than they receive back, the Appropriations Committee rejected that provision and added extra money so that the donee States would be happy. 
I think that is wrong. I think that is unfair. The law is the law. And, had that language not been added, the $475 million would have been credited by the current 1997 ISTEA structure. Instead, many States, including Arkansas, would not be receiving any of that $475 million. 
So let me just say that in the interest of fairness, yes, there are always winners and losers. But we need not exacerbate the winner-loser scenario by passing this supplemental appropriations in its current form. 
I ask my colleagues to support the Warner-Graham amendment in the name of fairness, in the name of equity for those States that have for so long gotten the short end of that economic stick. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to especially applaud this evening the Senator from North Carolina and the Senator from Arizona for their courageous opposition to this treaty. I also want to recognize the good and patriotic Americans and Senators who have differed on this treaty and have come down to different places on how they are going to vote. 
But this treaty is not about who is committed to and who believes in the elimination of chemical warfare in this world. I believe all of us are equally committed to that goal. 
I rise in opposition to the CWC because I simply believe that it is a flawed treaty in which we claim to verify the unverifiable, we are ratifying the unenforceable, and we are trusting the untrustworthy. We are binding ourselves and our friends, while those that we should be most concerned about go unrestrained and undeterred. When addressing the ratification of a treaty, we in this body are executing one of our most solemn duties. When addressing our Nation's security and when addressing our Nation's sovereignty, our watch words should be `prudence' and `caution.' 
I believe that prudence and caution call out for a `no' vote. By ratifying this treaty, we spurn the sage advice of former Secretaries of Defense. And I close with the words of one of those Secretaries, Secretary Cheney, who wrote that `This accord is worse than no treaty at all.' 
So, while I recognize and applaud the sincerity and the passion with which the advocates of this treaty have spoken and how they articulated their position, I believe firmly that it is not in the interest of the sovereignty and the security of the United States. And I urge a `no' vote on the treaty ratification. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I rise today to voice my serious reservations about the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty. The most important standards for an effective treaty are: Verifiability, protection to the signatories, constitutionality, and the applicability to nations of most concern. I sincerely believe that the CWC falls short in each of these basic requirements. 
On April 8, 1997 three former Secretaries of Defense appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee urging Senators to vote against the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. This fact alone should give this body great pause in the consideration of this treaty. 
I know that there are good, there are loyal, and there are patriotic Americans on both sides of this issue of ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention. I have many constituents who have called me, and said, `Senator, how do we know? We hear former Secretaries of Defense saying it is a bad treaty. We hear Colin Powell saying it is a good treaty. Today we hear former Senator Dole saying we need to ratify this. How do we know?' 
I believe that it is simply our responsibility as Senators, respecting the differences that exist, to study this, to evaluate it, and to make a reasoned judgment. I believe also when our national security is at risk that we must always opt on the side of caution in consideration of a treaty such as we have before us. 
Madam President, the opinions of Secretaries Schlesinger, Rumsfeld, Weinberger, and Cheney regarding this treaty should not be taken lightly. On April 7, in a letter to Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, former Secretary of Defense Cheney wrote, and I am quoting, Mr. President: 
The technology to manufacture chemical weapons is simply too ubiquitous, covert chemical warfare programs too easily concealed, and the international community's record of responding effectively to violations of arms control treaties too unsatisfactory to permit confidence that such a regime would actually reduce the chemical threat. Indeed, some aspects of the present convention, notably its obligation to share with potential adversaries like Iran, chemical manufacturing technology that can be used for military purposes and chemical defensive equipment, threaten to make this accord worse than having no treaty at all. 
Those words of Dick Cheney have echoed in my mind--`worse than having no treaty at all'. 
He said, if I might summarize, that the manufacture of chemical weapons is too widespread, concealing it is too easy, and enforcement is too uncertain for us to ratify this treaty.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, Secretary Cheney's statement sends a clear message to the American people that this treaty does not effectively deal with the threat of chemical and biological weapons. As we begin this debate on the CWC, the American people, with justification, will ask their leaders how and where they stand on the issue of chemical weapons. 
I stand here today wanting to tell the American people that this Congress will do everything in its power to rid our world of chemical and biological weapons, however, the CWC is not global, is not verifiable, is not constitutional, and quite frankly, it will not work. 
While the intent of the CWC is to create a global chemical weapons ban, accomplishing that goal does seem unlikely. Six countries with chemical weapons programs--including all of those with aggressive programs--have not yet signed the CWC. 
So how then can we call this a global treaty? 
Neither Iraq, Libya, Syria, nor North Korea have signed or ratified the CWC. China, Pakistan, and Iran have signed the CWC, but have not ratified it. Russia has signed the CWC, but has not ratified it. 
These rogue nations of Iran, Libya, North Korea, and Syria represent a clear threat to United States security and the security of key United States allies. All of these countries have active, aggressive programs to develop and produce chemical weapons. 
Let's be clear about one important thing. The administration has refused to ban inspectors from rogue nations such as Iran and China. 
That will be one of the reservations that we will have the opportunity to vote on. And it is one of those reservations that I find it incomprehensible that the administration has found unacceptable--banning inspectors from rogue nations such as Iran and China. 
In addition, there are intelligence reports that have recently indicated that Russia has already begun to cheat, even before the CWC has gone into effect. These facts alone give substance to opposing the treaty. 
Madam President, inherent in the CWC is a requirement that we share our advanced chemical defensive gear with countries like Iran and China. It is important to recognize that rogue nations, through reverse engineering, can easily figure out how to infiltrate our technologies. This would not only increase the chances of a chemical attack, but more importantly this would endanger our troops around the world. 
Let us be crystal clear on the fact that once there is a free-for-all of U.S. chemical and defensive technologies between the proposed signatories of this treaty, it will quite frankly be impossible to stop the transfer of this information to the rogue nations, that do not sign the CWC. 
I believe that the CWC will not increase pressure on rogue regimes. The CWC will not result in an international norm against the use of chemical weapons. The Geneva Convention of 1925 already established that norm. How many times has this prohibition been violated by Iraq, on the Kurds and even in the case of our own troops? 
Madam President, it took 5 years before the Pentagon came forward with information pertaining to the exposure of our own troops to certain chemical and biological substances that could affect the health and well-being of our 700,000 U.S. service people in the gulf. 
The rogues have demonstrated that they will plan for the use of, threaten the use of, and indeed use chemical weapons despite international norms. 
We must, to the best of our ability, avoid the horrible events of the 1980's, when the international community witnessed the horrors of Iraq's use of chemical weapons against its own people. Since that time, sanctions against Iraq have been strong and effective. The CWC will not address any shortcomings in these sanctions. 
Madam President, how can the CWC be global if these so-called rogue nations have not signed the CWC? The bottom line seems to be that the CWC is most applicable to the countries of least concern to the United States. It may help us with Great Britain, but provide no protection regarding North Korea or Iraq. 
It is my understanding, that under article XII of the treaty, members caught violating treaty provisions are simply threatened with a restriction or suspension of convention privileges. At worst, a report will be sent to the U.N. General Assembly and the U.N. Security Council. Mr. President, how does a report protect the American people? 
Madam President, with no predetermined sanctions in place to deter potential violators, the CWC seems ineffective and unenforceable. 
I am very sensitive to the needs and wishes of the small business-man. 
And while large multinational chemical corporations can bear the estimated astronomical costs regarding reporting requirements of a CWC member nation, these costs constitute a significant burden, in some cases an overwhelming burden, to small businesses, not just in Arkansas but all around America. There are roughly 230 small businesses which custom-synthesize made-to-order products and compete with large chemical manufacturers. It is my understanding that they generally have fewer than 100 employees and have annual sales of less than $40 million each. Few, if any, of them can afford to employ legions of lawyers just to satisfy the new reporting requirements of the CWC. Let us be realistic. Can these burdensome reporting requirements prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons? 
In addition to the cost factor on our small businesses, the possibility of U.S. trade secrets being stolen during CWC inspections to me at least seems very high. I have been advised that the U.S. intelligence community has said that the CWC inspections constitute a new tool to add to our intelligence collection tool kit. Putting one and one together, inspections will also constitute a tool in the kit of foreign governments as well. I hope that the American people realize that U.S. expenditures as a member nation of the CWC include a mandatory 25-percent assessment for operating expenses of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the OPCW.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. As a member nation, we will pick up a 25-percent assessment for the operating expenses of the organization. This is the new international organization created to administer the CWC. It is my understanding that operating costs are likely to be a minimum of $100 million per year, $25 million of which will come from U.S. taxpayers. 
Finally, it is my understanding that the CWC requires the United States to begin destruction of our chemical stockpile no later than 2 years after the treaty enters into force. I simply believe that is unreasonable and unattainable. 
The Department of Defense has publicly stated that the U.S. destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile will continue regardless of whether we are a signatory to such treaty. We have one such arsenal in Pine Bluff, AR. I believe it is unrealistic to expect that the $12.4 billion cost in destroying those chemical weapons will be achievable particularly given the environmental concerns that exist. And I am being contacted daily by those with environmental concerns about the Pine Bluff arsenal. So I believe that the recent debate on Yucca Mountain further illustrates how problematic the fulfillment of our treaty obligations would be. 
Madam President, I certainly want this body to provide a comprehensive domestic and international plan to reduce the threat of chemical and biological weapons. As I have already stated today, however, the CWC has too many loopholes that will perpetuate chemical weapon activity rather than end it. It is a serious obligation that we have. I believe that this body will make the right decision. For me, the words of Dick Cheney keep echoing: `Worse than no treaty at all.' 
For this Senator, I will be voting `no' on I believe a flawed, unfixable treaty. I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I proudly stand here today as a cosponsor of S. 495, Senator Jon Kyl's Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act of 1997. First and foremost, I want to thank the good Senator from Arizona for his commitment and hard work regarding chemical and biological weapon threats. This legislation certainly provides a comprehensive domestic and international plan to reduce the threat of chemical and biological weapon use. 
It sets forth practical, realistic, and achievable nonproliferation measures to combat the very real dangers posed by these weapons. 
Today the U.S. Senate will vote on the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act. Mr. President, for the first time in U.S. history, we will have legislation that provides the needed criminal and civil penalties against those who produce, stockpile, and transfer chemical weapons in the United States. 
Mr. President, as this body begins debate on the chemical weapons issue, I wholeheartedly believe that S. 495 will not only reinforce our strong commitment to eliminating chemical and biological weapons, but more importantly this legislation will provide our domestic law enforcement authorities the needed legal basis to enforce prohibitions on chemical weapons activities within the United States. 
I have heard the arguments against S. 495, including that it amounts to the `U.S. go at it alone,' approach. However, Mr. President, this bill sets forth a strong moral example for other nations to follow and in doing so underscores our commitment to global nonproliferation efforts. 
Furthermore, through the Australia Group, the United States and its principal international partners have worked together to prevent the transfer of dual-use chemicals and chemical weapon-related equipment. The Australia Group must remain a cornerstone of our international nonproliferation effort and Mr. President, the passage of this legislation accomplishes this goal. 
Mr. President, let me emphasize the strong points of this bill: 
It requires U.S. sanctions against any country that uses chemical and/or biological weapons against another country. In effect a range of sanctions can be imposed: arms sales, trade restrictions, foreign assistance, etc.; 
It outlaws the entire range of chemical and biological weapons activities within the United States. This bill mandates a $100,000 penalty for civil violations and provides the death penalty where chemical and/or biological weapons use leads to the loss of life; 
It establishes criteria for continued United States aid to Russia for chemical and biological weapons dismantlement and destruction; 
Most importantly, the assistance for dismantling Russia's chemical weapons stockpiles is contingent upon Russia's commitment to abide by already existing bilateral and multilateral agreements on chemical and biological weapons; and 
This legislation requires calling an international conference to strengthen the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibits the use of biological and chemical weapons. The Geneva Protocol has been violated on numerous occasions with little or no response from the states observing its prohibitions. Section 205 of this legislation would call for the creation of an international body whose purpose would be to ensure that the participating states will penalize any state violating the Geneva Protocol. 
Mr. President, we must, to the best of our ability, avoid the horrible events of the 1980's, when the international community witnessed the horrors of Iraq's use of chemical weapons against its own people. However, we took no action despite the clear and compelling evidence that this atrocity had taken place. 
To answer this threat, Senator Kyl's legislation directs the Secretary of State to convene an international negotiating forum for the purpose of concluding an international agreement on the enforcement of the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning the use of poison gas in war. 
Mr. President, one of the most important provisions of S. 495 is that it strengthens U.S. biological and chemical defense programs. The bill recommends three steps to improve the readiness of U.S. military forces in the area of biological and chemical defense. First, it would require the Secretary of Defense to ensure that U.S. military forces are prepared to conduct operations in a contaminated environment, particularly in the areas of operating ports and air fields. Second, it would seek improved allied support for biological and chemical defense to sustain operations in a contaminated environment. Third, it would require that the U.S. Army Chemical School remain under the oversight of a general officer. 
Mr. President, as we begin the debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention and whether to ratify or not, I believe that this legislation, S. 495, is significant because it establishes substantive and workable national policies for confronting the chemical weapons threat. 
The American people, with justification, will ask their leaders how and where they stand on the issue of chemical weapons. 
Mr. President, the passage of S. 495 will send a clear and unmistakable message to the American people that this Congress will do everything in its power to rid our world of all chemical and biological weapons. I urge my colleagues to adopt this measure. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today an important piece of legislation which will guarantee to all Americans an equal opportunity to compete for the nearly $60 billion of Government contracts. 
The Open Competition Act of 1997 ensures that no single special interest group will have an exclusive claim on Federal contracts, and would accomplish this by amending the National Labor Relations Act to simply prohibit discrimination in bidding for contracts funded by the Federal Government. 
The Clinton administration, specifically the Vice President, recently announced their intent to issue an Executive order which would, in practice, create a union-only mandate for all Federal projects. 
Upon closer examination, a disturbing connection exists between contributions made by big labor interests, the announcement of the proposed Executive order, and the individuals who actually drafted the language of this order. 
For the American people to fully understand what prompted these actions by the Clinton administration, it is essential to understand exactly what big labor did for them during the 1996 election. 
As widely reported after the November election cycle, labor unions spent between $300-400 million on the 1996 elections--Wall Street Journal, April 11, 1997. 
This amount is even more astonishing when you consider that it was financed in large part by dues-paying union members who were never asked by the union leadership if this was how they wanted their hard-earned wages spent. 
I firmly believe in the constitutional right to donate money to the political candidate of your choice. However, the problem here is what is asked for in return for this money, and even worse, what is given. 
The question must be asked--What did the labor unions get in return for the incredible amount of money they spent in the 1996 election? 
On February 18 of this year, at the AFL-CIO convention in Los Angeles, the Vice President pledged the administration's support for organized labor and announced several initiatives the administration would be launching in coming months. 
`How you treat your employees and how you treat unions counts with us,' said the Vice President--White House Press Release, February 18, 1997. He told the executive council of the AFL-CIO that the administration would issue an Executive order which would require Federal agencies to consider using project labor agreements on all Federal contracts--Bureau of National Affairs, February 19, 1997. 
These project labor agreements require all contracts for a particular job to be awarded only to contractors who agree to recognize designated unions as the representatives of their employees on that job. 
In addition, these agreements would require all contractors to use only union hiring halls to obtain workers, pay union wages and benefits, and obey the union restrictive rules, job classifications and arbitration procedures. The Open Competition Act would do away with this requirement and restore fairness to the bidding process. 
Just 3 days ago, on April 14, the Vice President announced that the administration was prepared to offer an Executive order encouraging Federal agencies to use project labor agreements--again, which generally require union representation--on Federal construction projects. 
His announcement was greeted by thunderous applause by almost 3,000 AFL-CIO trade union officials in Washington, DC. 
This Executive order becomes very interesting when you consider the parties who had a hand in drafting the language. The language in the draft was jointly developed by the AFL-CIO, the Clinton administration, and the Builders and Construction Trades Department. 
I believe this is a clear indication that the money spent by big labor during the 1996 elections not only provided the catalyst for this Executive order, but also gave them a seat at the table when it was written. 
Is this the way to build trust with the American worker? 
The Clinton administration would have us believe their actions benefit the majority of the American work force. But when you consider the percentage of Americans who belong to labor unions, this is clearly not the case. 
Of the total work force in America, only 14.5 percent belong to unions. When you consider just those workers in the construction industry, only 18.5 percent of those are union members. 
The facts clearly show that if this Executive order is implemented, only a minority of American workers will benefit. The 81.5 percent of workers who do not belong to a labor union will be placed at a clear disadvantage to the 18.5 percent who do. 
Essentially, this means 4 out of every 5 workers would face discrimination. This is clearly not the way to help the American worker. 
I want to make it very clear to the American people the detrimental effect this action by the administration will have on the American work force. 
The Open Competition Act which I am introducing today, will assure the vast majority of American workers that their government will not discriminate against them. 
This proposed Executive order will have the effect of creating a union-only mandate for all Federal construction projects. In addition, it would directly attack the principle of open competition in Federal contracting by excluding from the bidding process four out of every five workers who have chosen not to be represented by unions. 
The Federal Government should not be ordering discrimination against open shop companies which bid for federally-funded construction contracts. Rather, it should be encouraging competition for these contracts and promoting participation in the process by all companies who wish to bid. 
The Open Competition Act of 1997 would make sure this occurs. 
It would simply be unconscionable to institute a federal policy which would allow a special interest group to have an exclusive claim on Federal contracts based on their enormous political contributions to the current occupants of the White House. 
This distinguished body has the obligation to insure that Federal contracts are awarded through full, open, and competitive procedures. The Open Competition Act which I am introducing today along with Senators Lott, Nickles, Mack, Coverdell, Craig, Thurmond, Jeffords, Coats, Gregg, Frist, Enzi, Collins, Warner, McConnell, Allard, Brownback, Hagel, Kyl, and Roberts, guarantees that our constitutional prerogatives will not be infringed upon. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and guarantee to the American worker that their own Government will not discriminate against them.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for H.R. 1003. I want to commend the Senator from Missouri for his outstanding leadership on this issue, his willingness to be proactive about an issue that is very important to the future of our Nation, and also the Senator from North Dakota for his support of this measure as well. 
H.R. 1003 will prohibit Federal funding and promotion of assisted suicide and euthanasia. It is critically important that the Federal Government not appear to sanction suicide as a form of medical treatment in our varied Federal health care programs. Without this bill, that would be the very message we could be sending as we would potentially find ourselves funding and covering so-called mercy killing with Federal tax dollars. 
It should be mentioned that this bill passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives by a vote of 398 to 16. It enjoys obvious overwhelming bipartisan support. It involves only a prohibition of funding and does not affect the legality of assisted suicide or euthanasia. The bill simply says that the Federal Government will not be a part of the practice of assisted suicide and will not force all taxpayers to be a part of that practice. 
The Clinton administration should also be able to support this bill. When asked in the 1992 campaign about legislation to allow assisted suicide, President Clinton said, `I certainly would do what I could to oppose it.' 
On November 12, 1996, the Clinton administration filed a friend-of-the-court brief with the Supreme Court in opposition to physician-assisted suicide. In the brief for the administration, Solicitor General Walter Dellinger wrote: 
[T]here is an important and commonsense distinction between withdrawing artificial supports so that a disease will progress to its inevitable end, and providing chemicals to be used to kill someone. 
Given these statements, the President should be able to sign legislation that has the very modest effect of simply not funding assisted suicide. 
I agree with the statement of Walter Dellinger, Solicitor General. A patient may always decline or discontinue medical treatment even if that may incidentally lead to the patient's death. But that is a far cry from administering a lethal injection or providing lethal drugs to that patient. The former is a longstanding and recognized medical practice; the latter is medicalized killing. The Federal Government must not make all taxpayers be involved in such killing. 
Some may object that neither suicide nor the attempt at suicide are illegal. If people have a legal right to kill themselves, they continue, then it makes no sense to deny them the help of a physician in doing so, or to cut off the payment for doing that as this bill does. That is the logic. 
But it is incorrect to say that people have a right to kill themselves simply because we do not throw them in jail if they attempt to do so. 
Think of the following. We have a first amendment right to protest and denounce the policy choices of our elected officials in, say, a public park. If a supporter of that politician tried to physically restrain such speech, that person would be subject to criminal charges of assault and battery. 
On the other hand, suppose someone else tries physically to restrain another from committing suicide. As the Minnesota Supreme Court said in a 1975 case:  
[T]here can be no doubt that a bona fide attempt to prevent a suicide is not a crime in any jurisdiction, even where it involves the detention, against her will, of the person planning to kill herself. 
In fact, if public authorities detect someone in the act of attempting to commit suicide, they will typically not only 
interfere, but also place the person in the custody of mental health authorities. And posing a danger to oneself is a basis for involuntary commitment for mental health treatment. 
In short, it is not accurate to say that at present people have the legal liberty to commit suicide because they can be, and frequently are, legally restrained from doing so. 
Others may suggest that this is only for suicide attempts by the healthy. Everyone deplores the suicide of young, healthy people. But they contend some suicides are rational, like those of terminally ill patients. 
Contrary to the assumptions of many in the public, a scientific study of people with terminal illness published in the American Journal of Psychiatry found that fewer than one in four with terminal illness expressed a wish to die, and of those who did, every single one suffered from a clinically diagnosable depression. We must remember that it is the depression, not the terminal illness, that prompts a desire to die or to commit suicide. And that depression is treatable in the sick, the terminally ill, as well as in the healthy. 
Psychologist Joseph Richman, former president of the American Association of Suicidologists, the professional group for experts who treat the suicidal, points out that `[E]ffective psychotherapeutic treatment is possible with the terminally ill, and only irrational prejudices prevent the greater resort to such measures.' 
Dr. David C. Clark, a suicidologist, observes that depressive episodes in the seriously ill `are not less responsive to medication' than depression in others. 
So the solution for those among the terminally ill who are suicidal is to treat them for their depression, not pay to send them to Dr. Kevorkian. 
This bill sends us on the way to just that: not paying for patient killing so that we can focus on real medical treatment for the patients who need it. 
So I am glad to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1003, and in so doing, to send a very important message to the people of our Nation and to the culture of our country. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, every year like clockwork, with the approach of April 15, tax day, millions of Americans are out scrambling to find out how much they owe the Federal Government in taxes and how much they have overpaid the Federal Government in taxes. The IRS requires us to fill out complicated tax forms and, after plugging in numbers to formulas and performing various mathematical calculations, we come up with the magic number of what we owe the Federal Government or sometimes, rarely, what the Federal Government owes to us. To complete these tax forms is sobering. Sometimes it is a frightening experience, especially when you look at the block on your W-2 form that shows the amount of your income that has been consumed for tax purposes. 
The truth be told, the typical worker toils nearly 3 hours in a typical 8-hour workday just to pay taxes. Many families with two working parents find that one of those working parents is working full time just to pay Uncle Sam. Put another way, May 9 is tax freedom day. In theory, this is the day when an individual who has been working since January 1 will be able to take home his or her first paycheck. Every penny of the income they earn during that first 5 months of the year has gone to pay their annual income taxes. 
Our Nation's total tax burden is at an alltime high. Federal, State and local receipts remain at a record 31.7 percent of the gross domestic product. That is one-third of our Nation's total output now consumed in taxes. 
Even more demonstrative of the magnitude of the American tax burden is the fact that the average American family pays more in taxes, as we have heard over and over again, than it spends on food, clothing, and shelter combined. This, I think, is proof positive that American families are overburdened and in need of tax relief. 
That is why I introduced, with Senator Grams of Minnesota, who is on the floor this afternoon, the $500-per-child tax credit for all working families, regardless of income. Everyone talks about the importance of family values. It is time that we act to preserve American families by passing that $500-per-child tax credit. 
I talked to a person in Pine Bluff, AR. He said, `My children are grown. What do you have for me? I don't need that $500-per-child tax credit.' I said, `Sir, if you would just compute the benefit that you had as you had reared your children--they 
are now grown--you would see that the benefit that you had has been eroded through inflation and no longer exists.' And he was soon convinced. As we look at that per child dependent exemption, that would be over $8,500 had it been indexed for inflation. 
The 1997 tax season has been fraught with reports of abusive practices and sloppy management with the IRS--reports of taxpayer money being used to provide tax refunds to prison inmates at the nearby Lorton prison facility, of IRS agents improperly accessing taxpayers' returns, and of other coercive tactics employed by IRS agents to collect taxes. 
Americans already suffer under an unfair and incomprehensible Tax Code. As they struggle to be honest, taxpaying citizens, they should not have to worry about being harassed by an agency that, according to the General Accounting Office, cannot accurately account for its own $7 billion annual budget. 
I think millions of Americans feel as I do today, as we look at the Internal Revenue Service. We would say, `Physician, heal thyself.' 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding time and for organizing this time to talk about the desperate need for tax relief for American families and businesses. I rise today in very strong support for meaningful and permanent tax relief for American families and businesses. This is, I believe, no time for us as conservatives, no time for us as Republicans, no time for us as Americans to retreat or backtrack or to equivocate on our commitment to the American people that we will fight for them and fight for tax relief. 
One of the problems--and there are many--with the President's budget is that he matches temporary, very narrowly targeted tax cuts with permanent tax hikes. So while the minimal targeted tax cuts would be sunsetted, the American people will be obliged to continue to pay and pay and pay the tax increases. Not too long ago, Mr. Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, said, `Ultimately, you cannot solve the long-term deficits from the receipt side. It's got to be from the expenditure side.' 
Put very plainly, it seems to me that Mr. Greenspan is saying that the problem we have in our chronic deficits is not that the Federal Government does not have enough money, it is not that our National Government does not have enough revenues; it is that we are, in fact, addicted to spending. So the question is--and the debate continues to exist--Can we balance the budget and provide tax relief simultaneously? I think the answer to that is an emphatic, yes. The problem is not that we don't have enough revenues or that we need to increase taxes. The problem has been and continues to be that we spend too much and that we cannot get a control on our spending habit and that we are unwilling to deal with the very real problem of entitlement spending that consumes more and more of the budget pie. 
So I suggest that we can cut taxes and that we must cut taxes for the American people. There are three areas, I think, particularly that we need to emphasize. First, as the Senator from Wyoming emphasized, was family tax relief. Families today, working families, hard-working families, are being squeezed more and more by an ever larger tax bite--almost 40 percent for the average family--at the Federal, State, and local level, which is more than they are spending for housing, for education for their children, for health care, more than they are spending for recreation, all combined together, they are spending to the tax collector. That is too much. That is unfair. 
I also was listening to my constituents over the recess. We had 12 town meetings in Arkansas. In Fayetteville, AR, after making a speech and taking questions for more than an hour, a gentleman came up to me and said, `Senator, something is wrong in America.' He said, `I was raised in a family of eight of us. There were eight children. Mom stayed home, dad worked. Dad, as a single breadwinner in a single-income family, he could provide for the eight of us. We had a pretty good life. My dad had a high school education. Now I have a college degree, two children. My wife and I both work, and we can barely keep things together. Something is wrong.' 
While there may be many, many answers to that question, what is wrong and what has happened--a big part of it--is that Government has gotten larger, and as Government has gotten larger, its demand on the family has increased and the amount that it confiscates from the American family of higher taxes has grown to the point that the American family has a very difficult time paying it. 
We need family tax relief. We need estate tax relief. There are fewer things I heard more about during my town meetings than the need for estate tax relief. There are fewer taxes in this country I believe that are more un-American than the estate tax. There are fewer taxes that are more of a killer and a destroyer of the American dream than the estate tax. 
We used to say that part of the American dream is if you work hard, save your money, and if you invest well, that you not only will have a better life, but you will be able to pass that on to your children and grandchildren so that they will have greater opportunities than we have. But today, if you work hard and if you have done well, we will take 55 percent of it in estate taxes. It is killing that American dream, or a big part of that American dream. I think that is wrong. 
There are five bills in the Senate to reform or to eliminate the estate tax. I am on all of them. I think we need to at least raise the exclusion. But better yet, we need to eliminate it. It is a very ineffective way to fund the Federal Government anyway. We are 65 cents short in collections for every dollar that we receive from the estate tax. It is a very ineffective way of funding Federal programs. 
Then, finally, I want to mention that we desperately need immediate capital gains tax relief. I heard a great deal about this. This is what they say. They say, yes, the Republicans are for capital gains tax relief, that it is a tax break for the wealthy. Well, we know that the vast majority of tax filers will at some time in their life file capital gains on their tax returns, most of those being middle-income earners. It is not a tax break for the wealthy. 
Let me tell you how it plays out in Arkansas. A young couple started 30 years ago building a poultry farm in the Ozark Hills. They spent their life paying off that mortgage. They are getting up in age. They are not wealthy. But they have worked their whole lives to pay off that farm. Maybe they can no longer tend that big farm, or maybe they want to move into town close to the hospital, or maybe they need to get in close to the grandchildren. They go to sell that farm. They discover that the capital gains taxes would be so high that they can't afford to sell the farm they worked a lifetime to pay for. They are not wealthy. But that is what we have done with the capital gains tax. 
I will give you one other example. My chief of staff is from Stone County, AR. Stone County has one of the largest per capita incomes in the State of Arkansas. His parents own a little cafe called Cody's Cafe in Fifty-Six, AR, next to the State park. It is a good restaurant. It has good food. I recommend it. I eat there when I am in Fifty-Six, AR. But Todd's parents wanted to sell that little restaurant. It is a mom-and-pop operation. They don't have many employees. It is a very small cafe. They wanted to sell it and put it into another business, in another restaurant in another part of Arkansas. They had a buyer, somebody who was going to buy that cafe-restaurant. Those buyers undoubtedly were going to expand, 
and they were going to hire additional employees as well. Todd told his parents, `Before you make that deal, before you sign that contract, be sure to check with your accountant. Find out what the capital gains taxes will be.' 
When they checked they found they couldn't afford to make that sale. So they hung onto it. They continued to operate it. 
But I want you to think with me, my colleagues. What would have been the impact had they been able to make that sale, had we not had the exorbitant capital gains tax we impose? We would have had a new business started with new employees. The economy would have been stimulated with more taxes being paid to the Federal Treasury. We would have had new business owners there in Stone County with the desire to expand that restaurant operation, hire additional employees and, therefore, not only stimulate the economy in Stone County, but pay more taxes to the Federal Treasury. 
You take that little example from Stone County, AR, and multiply that thousands of times across the United States, and you begin to get the picture of what we could do in stimulating the American economy, and therefore making it easier for us to balance the Federal budget if we would simply cut drastically and dramatically the capital gains tax rate. I believe we need to do that. 
So I know there are others who are here to speak. I just want to conclude by saying this is no time for us to retreat on our promise made to the American people that we are going to work for tax relief. I believe it is the moral equivalent of what President Bush did in 1990. I admire and love President Bush, but I think he made a terrible mistake when he told the American people `no new taxes,' and then violated that pledge in reaching a budget deal. We must not, in our desire to reach some mythical budget deal, forsake, abandon, or equivocate on the promise and the pledge we made to the American people that we have come up here to lessen that ever-increasing tax burden under which they labor. 
So I, for one, will continue to work for a budget that is going to have family tax relief, estate tax relief, and capital gains tax relief for the American people. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President. I commend Senator Coverdell, in particular, for his leadership on this issue, his hard work and, along with him, Senator Feinstein, Senator Helms, the chairman, Senator McCain, Senator Dodd, Senator Hutchison, and the leaders for the hard work they put in. Certainly they put in many, many hours working to resolve a very thorny and very difficult issue. 
Having said that, it is with regret and some reservation that I say I believe the resolution before us today is totally insufficient. We have now taken a very substantive and meaningful action against a poor decision by the Clinton administration and turned it into a political football and, Mr. President, I believe we have fumbled the football on the goal line. 
While I realize the outcome of this vote is evident, it is clear I cannot, in good conscience, stay silent and not speak to the deficiencies of the resolution on which we will be casting our votes. 
As best I can tell, while the resolution says many good things, while it says some very meaningful things, when you boil it all down and when you look at it, the essence of what we get from this resolution is a report that we are asking the administration, we are telling the administration to give us in a few months, and that, after all is said and done, is all there is to it. 
I hold in my hand several newspaper accounts, recent newspaper articles which raise serious questions as to the efficacy of the Mexican Government's counternarcotics efforts. Let me just give you some of the headlines: 
`Another Mexican General is Arrested and Charged with Links to Drug Cartel.' 
`2nd Mexican General Faces Drug Charges.'

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the importance of Mexico's full cooperation with the United States antinarcotics efforts cannot, I believe, be overstated. Drug use among American teenagers has nearly doubled in the last 5 years. More importantly, more than 70 percent of illegal narcotics coming into the United States flow through Mexico. I know that many of those drugs originate in Colombia, incidentally, which we decertified, but 70 percent of those coming into the United States now flow through the nation of Mexico. 
Mr. President, as we all know, on February 28, the Clinton administration certified that Mexico cooperated fully with United States efforts to combat international narcotics trafficking during 1996. However, on February 27, the day before, the administration received a bipartisan letter from 39 Senators--I signed it, Senator Feinstein signed it, and many of my colleagues signed it--urging our Government to deny certification to Mexico. The facts unequivocally show us that Mexico has not--I say, has not--fully cooperated with us. 
Not one Mexican national out of the 100 or more that the United States wants for trial here on serious drug charges has been extradited to the United States, despite our Government's numerous requests. Not one has been extradited. 
Our own DEA Administrator, Tom Constantine, has recently said: 
There has been little or no effective action taken against the major Mexico-based cartels. . . 
Then he said: 
The Mexicans are now the single most powerful trafficking group--worse than the Colombian cartels. 
So while we are willing to decertify Colombia, our own DEA Administrator says Mexico is now worse, and we are going to certify them. You explain to me the logic in that, explain to me the consistency in that, explain to me how we, in good conscience, can do that. 
Mexico's counternarcotics effort is plagued by corruption in the government and the national police. Among the evidence are the eight prosecutors and law enforcement officials who have been murdered in Tijuana in recent months. Furthermore, the revelation that General Rebollo, Mexican's top narcotics official and a 42-year veteran of the armed forces, had accepted bribes from the Carrillo-Fuentes cartels casts grave doubts on Mexico's ability to curb corruption at the highest level of its government. Corruption is now, in fact, pervasive in the Mexican Government. 
Mr. President, we in this body must all be well aware that Mexico continues to be a major transit point for cocaine illegally entering the United States from South America, as well as a major source country for heroin and marijuana. 
The 1997 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, issued by the United States State Department, explicitly notes that Mexico is the transshipment point for 50 to 60 percent--50 to 60 percent--of the United States-bound cocaine shipments and up to 80 percent of the meth precursors. This report notes that in 1996, Mexico supplied 20 to 30 percent of the heroin and up to 80 percent of the foreign-grown marijuana entering the United States of America. 
The fact is that four Mexican drug trafficking organizations dominate the narcotics trade between the United States and Mexico. The DEA calls these groups the `Mexican federation' and estimates that they gross $10 billion to $30 annually in drug sales. Mr. President, those drug sales are to our children, to our Nation and to our culture, and they threaten the very future of our Nation. 
On February 28, 7 hours after the President announced his certification of Mexico, again with the full knowledge of congressional disapproval, Mexico's Attorney General's office issued a statement that its own senior officials had released Humberto Garcia Abrego, a reputed money launderer and brother of convicted drug kingpin, Juan Garcia Abrego. We do not know whether he was released earlier--whether it occurred on the 28th or earlier--with the announcement being held until after the President's certification decision was made public. But, again, we see how this country has been treated over a decade of this certification process. 
Mr. President, I ask you, can we not do better? Tom Constantine said, in short, there is not one single law enforcement institution in Mexico with whom DEA has an entirely trusting relationship. Can we not do better than that, certifying a country that cannot fully cooperate with our counterdrug efforts? What message does this send to our children about the seriousness of the drug war? Our children are the real victims of this policy. 
I have heard the repeated argument that if the narcotics market in the United States was not so bloated, then there would be no reason for a continual supply of drugs coming across our borders. Supply and demand. Quite frankly, I agree with that assertion. However, let's tackle that issue in the crime bill, not on the certification of a foreign country not being cooperative with our efforts. 
I am committed to winning the war on drugs, and we can only do that by championing the causes to reduce the amount of drugs in this country, appropriating funds for antinarcotics efforts, and assisting the DEA in the fight. But Mexico has not been helpful, and that is the fact and that is the truth. 
It is ironic, I think, that while we stand aside and certify Mexico's full cooperation, we pass a resolution that asserts that in fact that has not been the case. 
I have the joint resolution before me. It says this:  
There is evidence of significant corruption affecting institutions of the Government of Mexico (including the police and military). . . . 
It says this: 
In 1996, the Attorney General of Mexico dismissed more than 1,200 Mexico federal law enforcement officers . . . although some were rehired and none [none] has been successfully prosecuted for corruption. 
We are going to say, through the certification of Mexico, that they have been fully cooperative when that is not the reality of the resolution that we are passing. 
We say in the resolution: 
The Government of Mexico has recently approved, but has yet to implement fully, new and more effective legislation against organized crime and money laundering. 
That is what we say in the resolution we are going to vote for, which flies absolutely in the face of the certification of Mexico. 
The resolution says: 
Drug cartels continue to operate with impunity in Mexico, and effective action needs to be taken. . . . 
And yet we are going to certify Mexico as being fully cooperative and making progress. 
We have a resolution that we are going to vote on that says: 
Cocaine seizures and arrests of drug traffickers in Mexico have dropped since 1992. 
So while we say that arrests and seizures are down, we are going to say that we are going to certify them as making progress and being fully cooperative. 
Then on page 6 of the resolution, the sense-of-Congress portion of the resolution, we say: 
It is the sense of Congress that there has been ineffective and insufficient progress in halting the production in and transit through Mexico of illegal drugs. 
While we say that, we stand aside and allow certification to take place. 
I ask Mr. Coverdell, who controls this time, for 5 additional minutes.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. So while we say in the resolution it is our sense they have been ineffective and there has been insufficient progress, we allow certification to go forward, which says in fact they have been making progress and that they have been fully cooperative. 
To my colleagues I simply say, I think that is inconsistent, I think that is intellectually dishonest, and it is unfortunate, and it does a disservice to the citizens and our constituents whom we serve. 
We pass a resolution asserting that they have failed, that they have not made progress, and then we allow certification to go forward. 
How can we reconcile our treatment of the nation of Colombia a year ago and decertify and with a straight face now certify Mexico through which 70 percent of the illegal drugs flow into this country? You do it. I cannot. 
I believe that this certification process has become a sham. It is intellectually dishonest to move forward with that. The entire resolution upon which we will be voting contradicts that certification--two standards--that they have been fully cooperative and they have been making progress. We pass a resolution that says they have not been fully cooperative and they have not been making adequate progress. You reconcile that. I cannot. I yield the floor. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I stand here today in full support of House Joint Resolution 58 and Senate Joint Resolution 21, resolutions expressing Congress' disapproval of the President's certification to Congress that Mexico has fully cooperated with United States antinarcotics efforts during the last year. 
Section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act dutifully permits Congress to disapprove Presidential certifications made under this section if it enacts a joint resolution to that effect. 
The importance of Mexico's full cooperation with United States antinarcotic efforts cannot be overstated. Drug use among American teenagers has nearly doubled in the last 5 years. Most importantly, more than 70 percent of illegal narcotics entering the United States comes from the Nation of Mexico. 
Mr. President, as we all know, on February 28, the Clinton administration certified that Mexico cooperated fully with United States efforts to combat international narcotics trafficking during 1996. However, on February 27, 1 day before the President issued the certification, the day before the administration received a bipartisan letter from 39 Senators, myself included, urging our Government to deny certification to Mexico, the facts unequivocally show that Mexico has not fully cooperated with the United States. 
Seventy percent of the illicit drugs that enter the United States still enter through Mexico. There has been no change in those figures or on that front. 
The DEA says that Mexican drug traffickers are manufacturing massive and unprecedented quantities of high purity meth and supplying it to distribution networks here in the United States which are destroying our youth and creating a new front in the drug war. 
Not 1 Mexican national out of the 100 or more the United States wants currently for trial here in the United States on serious drug charges has been extradited to the United States, despite the numerous requests that our Government has issued to the Mexican Government. 
Our own DEA Administrator, Thomas Constantine, has recently said: 
There has been little or no effective action taken against the major Mexican-based cartels. . . . The Mexicans are now the single most powerful trafficking group--worse [even] than the Colombian cartels. 
Mexico's counternarcotics effort is plagued by corruption in the Government and in the national police. Among the evidence are that eight Mexican prosecutors and law enforcement officials have been murdered in Tijuana in recent months. The revelation that Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, Mexico's top counternarcotics official and a 42-year veteran of the armed forces, had accepted bribes from the cartels casts grave doubts upon Mexico's ability to curb corruption at the highest levels of its own Government. 
While there have been increases in the amount of heroin and marijuana seized by Mexican authorities, cocaine seizures remain low. The 1996 levels are half those seized in 1993. And the same holds true on drug-related arrests; they are half the figure of the 1992 level. 
Lastly, on the eve of full certification to Mexico, the Mexican police released a notorious money launderer linked to a major drug dealer, and the United States was informed of this fact only after certification was announced. The Mexican police officers who released the individual are now under investigation as a result of this early release. 
In the face of these substantive facts, President Clinton still certified that Mexico was fully cooperating with our antidrug efforts. As a father of three, I cannot in good faith be witness to the corruption of the well-being of America's children. 
Mr. President, the resolutions before us are simple. Mexico has failed with regard to antidrug cooperation; however, the President has certified giving them a passing grade. 
I say to Members of the Senate, both of these resolutions contain a waiver provision that would permit the President to continue both bilateral assistance and multinational development assistance for Mexico. By adopting these resolutions we are declaring that Mexico has not fully cooperated and therefore should not receive the United States certification. 
Mr. President, based on the facts, including the national interest waiver, we must send a message to the Nation of Mexico that the administration made the wrong decision and that these resolutions will set that record straight while preserving stability in our relationship with Mexico. 
So, Mr. President, I urge the adoption of both House Joint Resolution 58 and S.J. Res. 21 for the good of the Nation and for the good of our children. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah. I rise in strong support today of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I have three sons. My twin boys, today, are celebrating a birthday. They are 23 years old. I have an 18-year-old. 
In 1984, when I first ran for political office--the Arkansas State Legislature--I was asked, `Why would you get into politics?' I had three reasons: Jeremy, Tim, and Josh. I didn't know whether I could make a difference, but I was gravely concerned about the direction our Nation was going in and, particularly, the way our Nation was growing in deficits, chronic deficits, and a massive national debt. I wanted to be able to look them in the eyes and say, `I did what I could to give you a nation as good and as prosperous and with as much opportunity as I have had.' 
Well, in less than 2 hours from this moment, I will have an opportunity to cast a vote. We may not succeed in this balanced budget amendment, but I will have a clear conscience, and I will be able to look my sons in the eyes and say that I did what I could to bring a fiscal sanity to our Nation again. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
I will respond briefly to my good friend, the Senator from Wisconsin, regarding the political will and courage for the Senate, House--the Congress--to simply balance the budget. We heard that in the State of the Union Address: `Pass a balanced budget and the President will sign it.' We have heard that referred to repeatedly from the other side of the aisle. I stand next to 28 years of budget books, over 50 volumes that I think bears mute evidence to the lack of political will and courage in Congress and the evidence that we simply won't do it without constitutional discipline. 
In 1986, my brother, who now serves in the House of Representatives, was running for this body, the U.S. Senate. The balanced budget amendment the previous year had been defeated in this body by one vote. So that was a very big political issue in the campaign that year. Over and over again it was said, `We don't need the balanced budget amendment. We simply need the courage to do it.' So now, 11 years later, with over $1 trillion in additional debt, we hear those same recycled arguments brought before the U.S. Senate again. 
I want to comment a bit on the contention that the balanced budget amendment is both unenforceable and that the courts will impermissibly interfere with the budget process, or that a President may simply just impound things to resolve a budget shortfall. I agree with Senator Hatch's long-held position that a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution ought to be silent as to judicial review. The long-existing and well-recognized precepts of the standing separation of powers, as well as the political question doctrine, restrains courts from interfering with the budgetary process. After all, courts are loathe to intrude into areas that properly belong to other branches of Government. And the Constitution, in article I, solely delegates to Congress, not the courts, the power to raise taxes, borrow money, and increase or reduce spending programs. 
Courts simply do not have the authority to order Congress to raise taxes. Furthermore, courts will not grant standing to litigants who claim a generalized grievance similar to the complaints of all citizens, such as the raising of taxes, so as not to impose broad-based relief that interferes with congressional prerogatives. 
Federal courts simply do not have the authority to usurp Congress' role of the budgetary process. This is made clear by the time-honored precept of standing and the political question in 
separation-of-powers doctrines. These jurisprudential doctrines, together, stand as impenetrable barriers to the courts' commandeering of the democratic process. 
Additionally, I wish to respond to the impoundment argument. I want to emphasize that there is nothing in the balanced budget amendment that allows for impoundment. It is not the intent of the amendment to grant the President any impoundment authority. In fact, there is a ripeness problem to any attempted impoundment. Indeed, up to the end of the fiscal year, the President has nothing to impound because Congress, in the amendment, has the power to ameliorate any budget shortfalls or ratify or specify the amount of deficit spending that may occur in that fiscal year. Moreover, under section 6 of the amendment, Congress must--and I emphasize must--mandate exactly what type of enforcement mechanism it wants, whether it be sequestration, rescission, or the establishment of a contingency fund. The President, as Chief Executive, is dutybound to enforce a congressionally crafted scheme to the exclusion of impoundment. The position that section 6 implementing legislation would preclude Presidential impoundment was seconded by Attorney General Barr in 1995. 
Finally, let me address the rock and a hard place argument that opponents of the balanced budget always dredge up. That is, they contend, on the one hand, that there may be too much enforcement because of the courts, while, on the other hand, that the balanced budget amendment is unenforceable because no one can force the President and Congress to abide by the amendment's terms. Well, you can't have it both ways. The truth is that the President and Congress must abide by their oath of office to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. I seriously doubt that the basic terms of any constitutional provision will be flouted. Also, each branch will keep a close eye on the other, and the reality of political pressure and the electoral wrath of the American people will assure compliance. Remember, the budget must be in balance at the end of the fiscal year, and I expect that a budget agreement will be worked out well before that time. Instead, the contention against the balanced budget amendment actually argues in favor of a balanced budget amendment. It is clear that, without a constitutional hammer, the political process lacks the discipline to agree to the terms. 
Again, as we enter the final days of this debate on the balanced budget amendment, I think we need to step back on occasion from the very technical arguments and some of the very arcane amendments that have been proposed generally by those who oppose the underlying constitutional amendment and look at the reason we have come to this impasse, this situation. If, in fact, there are questions that cannot be answered about all of the consequences of a balanced budget amendment, and the one that is before this Senate, I believe, when you weigh those unanswered questions with the very clear evidence and the very clear and present danger to the future, the economic future, of the Republic that exists with massive debt and chronic deficits, that it is time we take whatever risk--and I think that risk would be minor--there might be in the passage of that constitutional amendment and submitting that to the States for ratification. We have a $5.3 trillion national debt. We have heard the figures over and over--$20,000 per every man, woman, and child in America. The average child reared today, if he or she lives an average lifespan, makes an average income, will spend over $200,000 of their income in Federal income taxes to pay their portion of the interest on this ever-growing national debt. 
Let us view this massive debt in another way. In 1960, after the first 140 years of the Republic, John D. Rockefeller, who at that time was the wealthiest man in America, could have singlehandedly paid off the national debt. In 1997, if we combine the wealth of our richest families--say, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, or from my home State, the Walton family--and we combine all of their net worth, all of their family wealth, they, together, could not even pay the interest on this massive debt for a few short months. Such is the difference, and such is the massiveness of the debt that we have accumulated and that we are imparting to generations in the future. 
Viewed from another perspective, if you laid out the debt in silver dollars, one right after another, it would be 120 million miles long. The word `trillion' becomes meaningless, I think, to the average American, as we hear millions, billions and trillions. But the national debt--$5.3 trillion--in silver dollars would be 120 million miles long. That is from the Earth to the Sun and well beyond--millions of miles beyond. 
If you could wrap it around the Earth you would wrap it around the Earth 5,000 times. Adam Smith in `Wealth of Nations,' published in the very year we became a Republic, said, `What is prudence in the conduct of a private family can scarcely be followed in that of a great kingdom.' 
I have heard opponents of the balanced budget amendment say, `Well, families go into debt. Families routinely go into debt. Therefore, deficit spending on the part of the National Government should not be anything that we should greatly worry about or be greatly concerned about.' Yes. Families go into debt. They have a home mortgage. They have car loans. They have the college loan. But if they are to survive as a family economically the deficits must never be chronic. They should always be short-termed. They should always be temporary. The debt must be manageable. There must be a schedule to pay it off and pay it down, all of which contrasts vividly with the practice of this Congress over the last 60 years. For in the last 60 years we have not paid down one dime on the growing national debt. No family could survive the habitual mismanagement that has characterized Congress for the past 28 years. 
Opponents say, `We don't need an amendment. We have the ability to balance the budget.' I say that we don't have the ability. We have the authority but we obviously don't have the ability, as these 28 years of budget books testify. 
In 1963 the amount of the debt held by the public was $254 billion. In 1996, it was $3.87 trillion, 15 times greater than in 1963. But since 1963 the promises have not changed. Let me just give you a sample. 
President Kennedy in the State of the Union Address in 1963 said, `My program is the surest and soundest way of achieving in time a balanced budget.' 
Or, the budget message of 1964 from President Johnson, `My budget cuts the deficit in half and carries us a giant step toward the achievement of a balanced budget.' 
Or, President Nixon in 1971 in his State of the Union Address, `I shall recommend a balanced budget.' 
Or, President Ford in 1976, `The combination of tax and spending changes I propose will set us on a course that not only will lead us to a balanced budget in 3 years but also improves the prospects for the economy to stay on a growth path that we can sustain.' 
Or, President Carter in his message to Congress accompanying the Economic Report of 1977, `We have moved on the path necessary for achieving a balanced budget in the very near future.' 
Or, President Bush in 1992 in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, `I will fight to reduce spending and spur growth so we can get this budget in balance.' 
And, President Clinton's address to the Nation in 1995, `I present the American people a plan for a balanced Federal budget.' 
In fact, it is not balanced. Three-fourths of the cuts, savings, and spending occur after this President will leave office. And the Congressional Budget Office tells us that even with all of that it is still very much out of balance. 
But the opponents continue to mock the idea of amending the Constitution. The statutory solutions that Congress have proposed simply have failed over and over and over again. They have failed from the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, and on and on. 
We found a way to circumvent or undermine and some way to continue our spending habit. And our opponents say, `Well, we are treating the Constitution as if it were a rough draft; that we have a raft full of amendments, a pocketful of constitutional changes.' Wrong. Our Founding Fathers I believe knew very, very well that changing circumstances in the life of our Nation would make it necessary to have a process for change and, therefore, they included an amendment process that is both deliberate and very, very difficult, as we are learning once again this year. But our Founding Fathers never envisioned that there would be a Congress, or a series of Congresses that would go 28 years without balancing its budget. Our Founding Fathers never envisioned that we would amass more than $5 trillion in public debt. But they left us a procedure whereby we can address even that kind of calamitous situation, a procedure of amending the Constitution. 
This isn't frivolous. This isn't like what we are about in attempting to amend the Constitution. It is as our Founding Fathers intended, a deliberate process by which we can address those circumstances that would threaten the very future of the Nation. And this massive debt does threaten. 
How much does the debt and the growth of the debt and the chronic deficits affect the average American? We have heard much talk about declining interest rates and how that will benefit the average American family. How things have changed. My mom and dad had only high school educations. They raised a family of six children. My father worked in a chicken plant, and my mother stayed at home. She didn't even go out and get a job. We lived in a nice home, a brick home. I thought we were poor. But we thought we were middle class. But all in all, we had a great quality of life. And I wonder how many times that could happen today? How many times today could you have parents without a college education with one spouse working and one spouse at home, and providing their children a college education? I say that, even as we look at the average middle-class family today, we see the erosion of our standard of living. And part of that is because the wealth of this Nation is consumed more and more by the massive spending of the Federal Government and the absorption of that wealth by paying interest on an evergrowing national debt. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I certainly agree--and Congress will, should we pass this amendment, and the States ratify this, and this become a part of the Constitution--Congress will, at long last, fulfill its constitutional oath of office and we will enforce a balanced budget. Congress has not done that. We have not done that because we lack a constitutional hammer, a constitutional discipline requiring us to do so. 
The courts will not be imposing taxes. The President will not be impounding. But Congress will be doing what will be, then, our constitutional obligation in balancing the books. 
Senator Kennedy's amendment is directed to the issue of judicial review. I believe it is in fact unnecessary. The relevant limitations on the powers of the courts, which are found in the doctrines such as ripeness, standing, and political question, effectively prevent Federal courts from raising Federal taxes or reallocating Federal budget priorities, which are the purview of Congress. Furthermore, as an additional safeguard pursuant to both article 3 of the Constitution and section 6 of the balanced budget amendment, Congress may limit the jurisdiction of courts and the remedies that courts may provide. 
No constitutional provision has ever contained a jurisdictional limitation on courts, as this amendment by Senator Kennedy would. Including this amendment in the balanced budget amendment might establish, I believe would establish, a troublesome precedent that courts might use to get involved in other areas of the Constitution that do not have such limitations. 
I believe that these amendments, one after another, are being proposed by those who would, of course, like to see a balanced budget amendment defeated. This is another scare tactic that is being thrown at the American people. 
We see that in the issue of impoundment that Senator Kennedy referred to. President Clinton recently said, `The way I read the amendment, it would almost certainly require, after the budget is passed, if the economic estimates turn out to be wrong, the executive branch, the President, the Treasury Department to impound Social Security checks or turn it over to courts to decide what is to be done.' 
That, to my colleagues I say, is a blatant scare tactic to try to defeat a much-needed amendment to the Constitution. 
If Senator Kennedy's amendment on impoundment is addressed as he indicated, then it is, again, unnecessary. First, the President has, at most, only limited authority to impound funds. The Supreme Court held that in the case involving President Nixon. 
Since the balanced budget amendment does not even mention the impoundment authority of the President, there is very, very little support for the claim that the balanced budget amendment would give the President such abilities. 
Second, Congress has plenary enforcement authority and, therefore, can, through new legislation, prevent the President from impounding appropriated funds. The Constitution does not mention impoundment. The power of the President in this area is merely implied by the President's general Executive power. This is very important because the Supreme Court has held that Congress has the authority to limit the President's implied powers, so long as it does not prevent the President from discharging his specific duties. 
Third, even in the absence of new legislation, the Line-Item Veto Act already regulates this area, thereby indicating how the Congress has allocated power to the President. In that law, Congress established a specific procedure for the President to follow. By so doing, Congress has occupied the field, to borrow a term from the law of Federal preemption, thereby precluding the President from exercising a general Executive power, like impoundment, in a different manner. 
So, I say again, this amendment, though I have no doubt it is well intended and addresses what are perceived to be legitimate concerns, is, in fact, unnecessary, plays upon the fears of the American people, and should be rejected. While we carry on this somewhat detailed debate, during this hour in which I have been on the floor of the U.S. Senate, the national debt will increase another $29 million. 
It is time, it is far past time, as these 28 years of budget books bear testimony, for this Senate to pass a balanced budget amendment, send it to the States for quick ratification and to begin to put ourselves under the same discipline that most of our States exist under and that every family in this country exists under: A requirement that we live within our means. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield myself 2 minutes. 
Mr. President, in response to my friend, I will simply say that the learned Justices may know little about budgeting, they may know little about national defense, they may know little about budget priorities, they may know little about exploding entitlements, but they have not been responsible, as we have been, for 28 successive years of deficits and the accumulation of $5.3 trillion in national debt. They have not been responsible for imposing upon my children and my grandchildren $20,000 of debt per person. They cannot be held accountable for our failings, and I emphasize once again, it will not be the Justices of the Supreme Court who will enforce this provision to the Constitution should it be ratified, and it will not be the President, through the impoundment process, that will enforce this; it will be Congress in obedience to and in fulfillment of their oath of office, an oath that requires us to protect and preserve and defend the Constitution of the United States, a Constitution that will, at that time, have enshrined within it a provision requiring us to balance our books. We will do the job. We will do it when we are required by the Constitution. 
Is it a shame we have to have that? I think it is. Is it unfortunate we have not had the courage, the political will to make the kind of tough decisions that would have allowed us to balance the budget and to have avoided our current situation? It is a shame. But the evidence is clear that short of an amendment to the Constitution, Congress will continue to allow spending to grow out of control, we will continue to have chronic deficits, and we will continue to amass enormous debts that threaten the economic stability and the economic future of our country. That is why we need a balanced budget amendment. And in order to have that amendment, we need to reject Senator Kennedy's I think unnecessary and ill-conceived amendment to the underlying amendment to the Constitution.

<DOCNO>105-hutchinson-ar-1-19970224</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for yielding. 
Mr. President, I rise today in total support of sound policies which advance and uphold the sanctity of life and family, but in opposition to House Resolution 36. The issue, I believe, in fact, is not one of family planning but is, in fact, one of funding for abortion, organizations which promote and provide for abortions and lobby to change pro-life laws in countries where our foreign aid money goes. 
First and foremost, allow me to recognize the importance of the two votes that took place in the House of Representatives on February 13. The Clinton resolution, which we will be voting on tomorrow--which unwisely, I believe, fails to include a ban on American taxpayer funding of organizations which provide and promote abortion--was successful by a vote of 220 to 209. But there was a second vote that occurred that day. The second vote, on H.R. 581, legislation of Congressman Chris Smith, of New Jersey, reinstituting the successful Mexico City policy and requiring foreign nongovernmental organizations receiving U.S. funds to agree not to violate the laws, or lobby to change the laws, of other countries with respect to abortion, or to perform abortions in those countries except in cases of rape, incest, or where the mother's life is in danger, 
that resolution by Congressman Smith was passed by an even larger majority of 231 to 194. So I remind Senators that the Smith pro-life resolution passed by a far greater margin than did the Clinton resolution. 
This vote certainly illustrates the simple fact that one can be for family planning programs while standing for life. 
As the Members of this body might recall, I am the only legislator in Congress to have served in the Arkansas House of Representatives when President Clinton was Governor of Arkansas. 
In October 1990, in response to written questions submitted by the Associated Press, the President, then Governor of Arkansas, said: 
Under the present Arkansas law, abortion is illegal when the unborn child can live outside its mother's womb, I support that . . . I have supported restrictions on public funding and a parental notification requirement for minors. 
I believe the President was absolutely correct when he took that position about funding for abortion, and that is the issue before us today. Despite President Clinton's repeated sentiments in wanting to lower the number of abortions performed, his actions, since he took office 4 years ago, has spoken louder than his words. 
In fact, President Clinton has actively fought to lift any and all restrictions on taxpayer-funded abortions, not with congressional approval but by the broad use of the Executive order. Besides refusing to reinstate the Mexico City policy, which had been working very successfully for a decade before he repealed it, he has also attempted to delete the ban on taxpayer funding of abortions and the ban on the use of funds to counsel persons on the practice of abortion. Similarly, his annual budgets have also proposed striking this pro-life language from the foreign operations appropriations bill. 
We all know that congressional appropriations for U.S. population assistance have been delayed by the debate over the issue of U.S. funding for abortion and coercive birth control measures practiced by foreign countries. 
Mr. President, at the second annual U.N. International Conference on Population in Mexico City in 1984, the Reagan administration announced that it would discontinue U.S. population aid to those nongovernmental organizations that were directly involved in voluntary abortion activities. 
The Mexico City policy went a step beyond previous legislation that had been passed in the 1970's that specifically banned direct funding of abortions and involuntary sterilizations. The Mexico City policy banned funding to nongovernmental organizations that were indirectly involved in abortion-related activities. 
Furthermore, the Reagan administration established a requirement that the U.N. Family Planning Agency provide `concrete assurances that it is not engaged in, or does not provide funding for abortion or coercive family planning assistance programs.'

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, 2 days after his 1993 swearing-in ceremony, President Clinton submitted an Executive order repealing the Mexico City policy. This repeal now allows American taxpayer funds to be given to the United Nations planning agency in support of coercive abortions and involuntary sterilization, commonly practiced in places like China, a position which is completely contrary to the desires of the American people. 
I sincerely consider these practices of involuntary sterilization and coercive abortion to be well outside the boundaries of what can be legitimately called family planning. 
Most organizations agreed to the terms of the Mexico City policy, even giving up their pro-abortion activities in some cases, in order to receive U.S. funds. It did not decrease by even 1 penny the amount of funding for international population control assistance programs. Rather, it ensured that family planning dollars were sent to organizations which neither promoted nor performed abortion as a method of family planning. 
Furthermore, since 1973, when Congress passed the Helms amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act, Federal law has prohibited direct payment of most abortion procedures with U.S. foreign aid funds. The Helms language was also included in the annual foreign operations appropriations bill last year. 
For most of the years it has been in effect, the Helms amendment has not been challenged either in the Foreign Assistance Act or in the foreign operations appropriations bill. However, since President Clinton has been in office, he has continually sought to repeal the Helms amendment ban on foreign abortion funding, thereby subverting the will of the vast majority of Americans. 
The American people overwhelmingly oppose the use of taxpayer funds to perform or promote abortion. And at one time, I might add, so did President Clinton. On September 26, 1986, then Governor Clinton wrote the following letter to the Arkansas Right to Life: 
I am opposed to abortion and to Government funding of abortions. We should not spend State funds on abortions because so many people believe abortion is wrong.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, because of the concerns of the Clinton administration's population assistance policy, this Congress added language that requires any amount that the United Nations population fund spends on family planning programs in China be deducted from its total United States appropriation. 
Communist China has one of the worst human rights records in the world, promoting forced abortions and sterilizations to limit births. It is a country which has little regard for human life and, in particular, the lives of little baby girls. Press reports are filled with accounts of beautiful female children who are abandoned by their families because under China's one-child-per-family rule, male children are considered more desirable. This policy is and should be offensive to all civilized people. 
If the administration's resolution is passed by the Senate tomorrow, the American taxpayer will become an unwilling participant in China's outrageous practices because some of the $25 million designated for United Nations population fund will go to China. 
Without the Mexico City policy, the United States will be giving money to such countries and organizations which blatantly promote and support pro-abortion policies and procedures. This should be unacceptable to all of us. 
While I believe the United States can provide meaningful assistance to countries attempting to control their population growth, I adamantly oppose American taxpayer funding for abortion both home and abroad. 
While I will continue to support continued U.S. population assistance programs, I also believe that the United States should encourage the development of market economies which improve the standard of living for growing populations. 
This resolution came about because of the Clinton administration's refusal to accept pro-life language preventing AID grantees from using foreign aid dollars to promote abortion. 
Mr. President, please remember at the end of the last Congress, White House negotiator and former Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, adamantly rejected a proposal which would have allowed AID to spend as much as $713 million for international family planning by the end of the fiscal year. This takes into account $303 million carried over from fiscal year 1996. 
The proposal provided $385 million for population control programs, in addition to $25 million for the U.N. Family Planning Agency. If an organization did not agree to the terms of the Mexico City policy, it would only receive up to 50 percent of the population funds it received in fiscal year 1995. All the fiscal year 1997 funds would be available in fiscal year 1997. 
The administration rejected this proposal because of the nominal pro-life conditions on the fiscal year 1997 funds. Even without the other evidence of the Clinton administration's abortion activities, this stand by the administration is a clear admission that family planning funds are used to establish, sustain, and build up abortion providers and pro-abortion lobbying in developing countries, and the ability of AID grantees to perform and promote abortion in developing countries is the real priority of the administration. 
It is obvious that this battle will be renewed each year on the foreign operations appropriations bill until the pro-life position prevails, as it has ultimately prevailed on the Hyde amendment, the ban on Federal employees health benefits coverage of abortions, the prohibition on abortions in military hospitals, and all other pro-life amendments which became law over the President's opposition. 
I cannot stand here today and believe the Clinton administration's claim that it wants to reduce the number of abortions when United States dollars are given to organizations which actually perform abortions and which lobby to legalize abortions in countries like Latin America, Africa, and other regions of the world which recognize the humanity and the value of the lives of unborn children. 
The Clinton administration continues to emphasize that no U.S. funding goes directly to abortion practices. However U.S. funding is allocated to organizations like International Planned Parenthood Federation, which receives $70 million from the United States. The IPPF makes no secret of their pro-abortion commitment, which is apparent in their `Vision 2000 Strategic Plan.' 
With millions of U.S. dollars each year providing funding for the IPPF's lobbying campaigns, overhead, and utilities, how can we then say that American taxpayer dollars are not being used to fund abortions? I believe they certainly obviously are. 
 Mr. President, we must end this practice of the IPPF and similar groups exploiting the hard-earned dollars of every taxpaying citizen across this great Nation. 
The will of the American people is being subverted by this policy. Americans do not want Federal tax dollars being used for abortions. This applies to our foreign aid policies as well as our domestic agenda. 
 Mr. President, I will leave you today with a quote from Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Mother Teresa made this comment on February 3, 1994, at the National Prayer Breakfast. Many of us were in attendance that day. I was there and so was the President. I believe that this statement speaks volumes. She said:  
But I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child, a direct killing of the innocent child. 
The issues in this debate are not just family planning, whether millions of pro-life American taxpayers will be required to help foot the bill for a practice they find morally reprehensible; but also ceding control of taxpayer dollars to foreign governments over which we have no control. I believe that is unacceptable. 
I think it is wrong to ask pro-life American taxpayers to foot the bill for that which they find morally offensive and morally wrong. I yield the floor. 
Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today an important piece of legislation which will enable thousands of businesses in my home State of Arkansas, and across the Nation, to avoid an unscrupulous practice which is literally crippling business. 
The Truth in Employment Act will protect these businesses and curtail the destructive union tactic known as salting. It may not be in the same magnitude of issues as the balanced budget amendment, which I am deeply concerned about and in which we have had prolonged debate, but it is nonetheless a very, very significant issue that is affecting the economic well-being of thousands of businesses across America. So I am glad to be able to introduce this today with 14 cosponsors joining me on S. 328. 
Salting is the calculated practice of placing trained union professional organizers and agents in a nonunion workplace whose sole purpose is to harass or disrupt company operations, apply economic pressure, increase operating and legal costs, and ultimately the purpose of putting that company out of business. The objectives of these union agents are accomplished through filing frivolous and unfair labor practice complaints or discrimination charges against the employer with the National Labor Relations Board [NLRB], the Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA], and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC]. Salting campaigns have been used successfully to cause economic harm to construction companies and are quickly expanding into other industries across the country as well. 
To my colleagues I would say, Mr. President, the average cost to the employer to defend himself or defend herself against this practice runs upwards of $5,000 per case. 
Salting is not merely a union organizing tool. It has become an instrument of economic destruction aimed at nonunion companies. This is what happens. Unions send their agents into nonunion workplaces under the guise of seeking employment. Hiding behind the shield of the National Labor Relations Act, these salts use its provisions offensively to bring hardship on their employers. They deliberately increase the operating costs of their employers through actions such as sabotage and frivolous discrimination complaints. 
In the 1995 Town & Country decision, the U.S. Supreme Court held that paid union organizers are employees within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. Because of their broad interpretation of this act, employers who refuse to hire paid union employees or their 
agents violate the act if they are shown to have discriminated against the union salts. 
This leaves employers in a precarious and vulnerable situation. If employers refuse to hire union salts, they will file frivolous charges and accuse the employer of discrimination. Yet if salts are employed, they will create internal disruption through a pattern of dissension and harassment. They are not there to work--only to disrupt. For many small businesses this means that whenever hiring decisions are made, the future of the company may actually be at stake. A wrong decision can mean frivolous charges, legal fees, and lost time, which may threaten the very existence of their business. 
I have received many accounts from across the Nation of how salting is affecting small businesses. In Carmel, IN, John Gaylor, of Gaylor Electric, is a favorite target of the local International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Mr. Gaylor has to budget almost $200,000 annually to defend himself against frivolous charges. In fact, Gaylor has been forced to defend himself against at least 80 unfair labor practice complaints. However, in each case the charges against him were dismissed as frivolous. Nonetheless, he is bound to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to attorneys to defend himself. 
In a classic example of salting tactics, Gaylor had to fire one employee after his refusal to wear his hardhat on his head. This employee would strap the hardhat to his knee and then dare Gaylor, his boss, to fire him because he said the employee manual stated only that he had to wear the hardhat, it did not state where he had to wear it. 
Another common salting practice is for salts to actually create Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] violations and then report those violations to OSHA. When the employer terminates these individuals, they file frivolous unfair labor practice violations against the employer. This results in wasted time and money, as well as bad publicity for the company. 
These are just a few of the many examples of how devastating this practice can be to small businesses. What makes this practice even more appalling is how organized labor openly advocates its use. According to the group, `Workplaces against Salting Abuse,' the labor unions are even advocating this practice in their manuals. 
The Union Organizing Manual of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers explains why salts are used. Their purpose is to gather information that will  
* * * shape the strategy the organizer will use later in the campaign to threaten or actually apply the economic pressure necessary to cause the employer to * * * raise his prices to recoup additional costs, scale back his business, leave the union's jurisdiction, go out of business, * * * 
The International Vice President of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union has been quoted as saying that: 
If we can't organize them, the best thing to do is erode their business as much as possible. 
That is what we are facing. The balance of rights must be restored between employers, employees, and labor organizations. The Truth in Employment Act seeks to do this by inserting a provision in the National Labor Relations Act establishing that an employer is not required to employ a person seeking employment for the primary purpose of furthering the objectives of an organization other than that employer. Furthermore, this legislation will continue to allow employees to organize and engage in activities designed to be protected by the National Labor Relations Act. 
This measure is not intended to undermine those legitimate rights or protections that employees have had. Employers will gain no ability to discriminate against union membership or activities. This bill only seeks to stop the destructive practice of salting. Salting abuses must be curtailed if we are to protect the small business owners of this Nation. This legislation will ensure these protections are possible. 
I am glad that Senator Nickles, Senator Warner, Senator Mack, Senator Kyl, Senator Brownback, Senator Cochran, Senator Roberts, Senator Hatch, Senator Gorton, Senator Enzi, Senator Gregg, Senator Allard, Senator Sessions, Senator Faircloth, and the majority leader, Senator Lott, have joined as original cosponsors of this legislation. 
It is for these reasons I am introducing the Truth in Employment Act. I ask more of my colleagues to support this bill and restore fairness to the American workplace.

 Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to express my support of the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of which I am a cosponsor. This bill would ensure that no Federal tax dollars are used to pay for or promote assisted suicide or euthanasia. In addition, it identifies those Federal programs which may not be sued to pay for assisted suicide. These programs include Medicare, Medicaid, Federal Employees Health Benefits plans, medical services for Federal prisoners, and the military health care system. 
This bill also makes clear that Federal law will not require health care facilities, in States where assisted suicide has been legalized, to advise patients at the time of admission about their `right' to get lethal drugs for suicide. 
This legislation is needed due to recent Federal court rulings which have declared a constitutional right to assisted suicide. The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in two cases on January 8 of this year to determine the constitutionality of those rulings. In addition, some States, such as Oregon, have legalized assisted suicide by referendum. These States may be tempted to consider using Federal funds and facilities to pay for these procedures. For this reason, we must send a clear message. The American people do not want their tax dollars used to pay for assisted suicides. In fact, a majority of Americans are strongly opposed to the very notion of assisted suicide. Counted among those in opposition are the American Medical Association whose physician members would be asked to play the role of moral arbitrator in the decision to end one's life. 
The purpose of this bill and its guidelines are concise and clear. No limitations will be placed on the withholding or withdrawing of medical treatment. In addition, it does not affect funding for alleviating patient pain or discomfort. 
An overwhelming majority of the American people believe their taxes should not be used to pay for assisted suicide or euthanasia. A national Wirthlin poll taken in November 1996 found that 87 percent of Americans did not believe their tax dollars should be used to pay for these procedures. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill which guarantees every American that their tax dollars will not be used to pay for or promote assisted suicide or euthanasia.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes from the time allocated to Chairman McCain. 
Mr. President, last week I had the opportunity to speak before the Commerce and Environment and Public Works Committees on behalf of my good friend and our nominee for Secretary of Transportation, Rodney Slater. I am proud today, and honored today to be able to rise before the entire Senate body and once again voice my support for the President's choice for Secretary of Transportation. 
I have known Rodney Slater since the 1980's, when I was first elected to the Arkansas State House of Representatives and Rodney was the executive assistant for then Governor Bill Clinton. From the very beginning of our relationship, I had the deepest respect for Rodney on both a personal and professional level. 
Professionally, I think there is no question whatsoever that he is qualified to become the Secretary of Transportation. Before coming to Washington, Rodney served for 6 years as commissioner and later chairman of the Arkansas State Highway Commission. During this time, Rodney, without hesitation, tackled the great challenge of improving a poor rural State's infrastructure. He took on that challenge, not just trying to please, but trying to do the right thing. Arkansas, like most of our States, is a very diverse place with many competing regions. Rodney, though he hailed from the delta, was always fair to every part of the State of Arkansas. I think that is a preeminent qualification for somebody who is going to be Secretary of Transportation of the United States. He will be fair with all modes of transportation. He will be fair to all parts of our Nation. 
In the last 4 years, Rodney has served as Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, where he has faced the demands of implementing ISTEA. As you know, hearings on the reauthorization of ISTEA will begin next week. We will be dealing with some of the most important and complicated issues of transportation when we consider this vital piece of legislation. Rodney's experience with national and local transportation needs as well as his expertise in the intricacies of ISTEA give me great confidence he will be able to work with Congress in a manner that will help us form legislation that will not only be fair but will address the Nation's pressing transportation needs into the 21st century. Certainly I look forward to working with a Secretary of Transportation who brings hands-on experience to the Department. 
On a personal note, I cannot adequately express my esteem for Rodney, for the courage he has shown in overcoming a childhood of deprivation. He is a native of Marianna, AR, the Mississippi Delta region, one of most impoverished of our Nation. Many children grow up in those conditions and find that poverty overcomes them. They never come close to reaching their full potential. Rodney serves, I believe, as a role model for countless Americans who pull themselves up from poverty to make the American dream a reality. If you judge a person from what they overcome, then Rodney Slater has overcome a lot, and should be esteemed. He has not only benefited his own life, but the lives of those he has touched through his selfless public service. His experience in the region of the world he came from, I think, gives him a unique perspective of the value of our Nation's infrastructure and the role it plays in economic development. 
Another one of the great things about Rodney, which I have expressed many times, is his commitment to his family. Nobody could question that after watching the confirmation hearings. Several of his family members came there at each time. 
I want to reiterate my comments from last week. I have no hesitancy whatsoever in giving my support for Rodney Slater to be Secretary of the Department of Transportation. I believe the President made a fine choice and I look forward to casting my vote for that confirmation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the balanced budget amendment. I think it is one of the most important pieces of legislation we will be debating in this body, in this Congress. I might add, I appreciate the preceding Senator, Senator Durbin, acknowledging, as he presented his amendment to the balanced budget amendment, his overall 
opposition to the underlying amendment to the Constitution. We are going to, I suspect, hear many amendments--several amendments at least--offered in the coming weeks, with the primary goal of ultimately defeating the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
As I said, I believe this is one of the most important pieces of legislation we are going to debate. The opponents of a balanced budget amendment argue that to compel Congress to balance the budget will forever damage and eliminate the ability to provide our seniors with the protection they have earned. Their plan--and we will be hearing more of it; we have already heard quite a lot--to exempt Social Security is nothing more than a risky gimmick. I say again it is a risky gimmick to put such an exclusion onto the balanced budget amendment. Their arguments are aimed at scaring the most vulnerable segments of our population. 
In the last 2 years, in my experience in the House of Representatives and as I observe the deliberations in the U.S. Senate, we have seen a great deal of those efforts to scare those who are most vulnerable in our society. So I suppose it is not that unusual, as we enter a debate on the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, to hear those who would frighten and those who would scare the most vulnerable in our society. They assert Social Security checks will be withheld because there will be no money left in the Treasury.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, a part of that editorial says this: 
The chances of Social Security checks being sequestered fall into the same range of probability as the Loch Ness monster posing for photographs. Both possibilities are great for scaring folks, but for little else. 
I believe that is very, very true. Again, nothing could be a more risky gimmick to be put onto the balanced budget amendment than to exclude Social Security from the provisions of the amendment. It is attempting to replace the truth with fear. 
The plain truth is that the President does not have the power to withhold appropriations, such as Social Security. Only Congress can give him that power. It is our responsibility to appropriate the funds necessary to carry out the domestic and the foreign policy programs of this Nation. In reality, the balanced budget amendment will ensure that money is there to spend. 
Today, annual deficits and the national debt are the greatest threat to Social Security's existence. If we talk about the threat to the future of Social Security, let us not forget that the greatest threat is continued chronic deficits and an unwillingness or a lack of discipline and a lack of will on the part of the politicians of this country to bring our books into balance. 
I believe this very vivid depiction of having 28 budget books stacked on top of each other is very clear evidence that the notion--as the President put it in the State of the Union Address--that we can just do it, we pass it and he will sign it, we will balance the books, will not happen, as we see with 28 budgets before us. It has to stretch the credibility of not only the executive branch but a Congress that is more inclined to continue spending on ever-expanding entitlement programs. 
Since the 1930's, literally dozens of proposals have been made to require a balanced budget to limit the size or the growth of the Federal budget or public debt, or some combination of these ideas, including several very notable recent efforts in 1990 and, again, in 1993. These have come in the form of bills, statutory efforts, and proposed constitutional amendments. An average, Mr. President, of more than 30 measures per Congress have been introduced in recent years. 
I believe one reason that we have seen such statutory efforts and so many offers of various constitutional amendments is because many of those who occupy the Halls of Congress today, both at the other end of the Capitol in the House of Representatives and in the U.S. Senate, once served in State legislatures where they have the yearly annual experience of seeing their State budgets balanced. They came from State legislatures where there were constitutional provisions that required them to balance their budget, and they saw year after year after year that it could be done. 
So when they came to Washington, they came with a determination, they came with a deliberation that we would have, in fact, that same provision embodied in the U.S. Constitution. But it has been frustrating. Year after year and time after time, we have seen those efforts defeated. 
The opponents of a balanced budget amendment, I believe, are pursuing a campaign of deliberate disinformation. There has been and will continue to be an effort to distract and to divert the attention of the American people from the real issues that are at stake in the debate over a balanced budget and over a balanced budget amendment. The opponents would distract and divert the American people from the real threat to Social Security, which is chronic deficits and enormous accumulated debt. They would like the debate over the coming weeks to be about Social Security, but the debate is not about Social Security. The debate is about the chronic deficits that threaten the future economic stability of this Government and our economy in years to come. That's what it is about. 
If you care about Social Security, you should care about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, because that is the best way of ensuring fiscal sanity being restored to our budget process. Without a credible, sustainable balanced budget, we will never have the money to pay out future benefits. It is just that simple. A balanced budget amendment needs economic prosperity that will produce revenues necessary to fund the program. With a balanced budget, the big spenders in Washington will not be able to target and, therefore, raid Social Security to pay for other programs. 
Opponents of the balanced budget amendment will throw out, I think, any diversion to confuse the issue. They will use scare tactics. The truth is that excluding Social Security does nothing to secure benefits into the future. The President's own budget counts these surpluses to achieve his balance. 
What if Social Security is excluded? Social Security will not be protected, but between the years of 2002 and 2007, the deficit will appear $700 billion larger. That means either a mammoth tax hike on American families, almost $1,100 per year per household, or devastating cuts in important programs like Medicare, cancer research, Head Start, and environmental cleanup. 
In the years since 1960, the budget has been balanced only 
once. Deficit spending during that period has increased the official national debt from less than $284 billion to over $5 trillion, and the 28 budget books that are stacked right over here give vivid evidence of that failure of Congress to discipline its spending habits. 
Interest payments on the debt now consume about $240 billion annually; $240 billion annually just on interest to service the national debt. The $240 billion that we are spending in interest payments is larger than the combined budgets of the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Education, Energy, Justice, Interior, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, State, and Transportation. 
I suggest that if we have a commitment to education, then we ought to have a commitment to a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to ensure that these exploding interest payments will finally be reined in. In the future, the debt problem will only get worse. The Government's current debt calculation fails to include the 10 to 20 trillion dollars worth of unfunded liabilities. These are promises to pay future benefits like Social Security, Medicare, Government employee retirement and other programs. In short, we will soon long for the days of $200 billion deficits unless something is done, and that something should be the balanced budget amendment. 
When you exclude Social Security, you derail the very purpose of the amendment. I was interested, as I listened to the deliberations of the House Judiciary Committee earlier this week on the balanced budget amendment, in the testimony of a former Congressman, my former colleague, Tim Penny. He referred to this gimmick of taking Social Security off budget and out of the unified budget as being the greatest money-laundering scheme in history, because future creative Congresses will find it not too difficult to begin to shift programs into the Social Security trust fund so as to circumvent the purpose and the goal and the intent of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It is a loophole so large, not only can a truck drive through it, but tons and tons of red ink can flow through it. 
Finally, the goal of such an amendment is to defeat the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
As I said, I am glad that Senator Durbin acknowledged his underlying opposition to an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced budget altogether. So while he offers this amendment to the BBA, he still opposes the concept of an amendment requiring a balanced budget. 
Secretary Rubin--who was quoted earlier this afternoon--Secretary Rubin, when he testified before the House Judiciary Committee, was asked by my brother, Congressman Hutchinson, whether there was any balanced budget amendment that he could envision that he would be able to support? In other words, if you went ahead and excluded Social Security, or if you put in a recession provision, or if there were some other addition to a balanced budget amendment, was there any such amendment that Secretary Rubin or the administration could support? And when finally pressed, Secretary Rubin said no. He said he could not envision any amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced budget in any form that the administration would support. 
I think that really tells the story, that while there will be efforts to divert attention, while there will be efforts to distract the attention of the American people, all of the amendments that are offered are in the end ultimately being offered with the goal of defeating this very, very important amendment to the Constitution. 
I want to put a human face on the balanced budget amendment. We can often become too consumed with who has political advantage in policy debates that we forget who sent us here and how it often affects them. Let me tell you about one of my constituents. Bob Boyd, a small business owner in Little Rock, is the kind of person who can speak to the importance, I think, of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
Mr. Boyd was a delegate to the White House Conference on Small Business. During that time, he and the conference made several recommendations to President Clinton. The one proposal which received the most votes, more than any other policy recommendation by the White House Conference on Small Business, was for the adoption of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Unfortunately, that proposal has only collected dust at the White House. But this was from the White House Conference on Small Business, the recommendation that received the most support. 
When asked why so many of the conference voted on this proposal and voted for this proposal, Bob simply says:  
. . . as a small business owner, we know the importance of the bottom line and [the] government doesn't, they have lost the principle of being responsible for their debts. 
Bob said that the President told them `that small business is the engine that drives our economy.' Unfortunately for Bob, and for all the small businesses in Arkansas and America, the national debt, and the taxes it needs to pay for it, are taking up all the fuel. 
I strongly believe that ratification of a constitutional amendment is the only way to turn around this unending sea of financial debt. It is time to put the harness of the U.S. Constitution on Congress and the President. It is time to require these institutions to be more fiscally responsible than our predecessors have been. 
I would just say again, as I conclude, Mr. President, that there is a fundamental immorality that goes along with chronic deficit spending. For decades and for generations of our history as a Nation, a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget was not necessary because there was an inherent fundamental belief on the part not only of our policymakers and our politicians but the people of the United States as a whole that spending more than you take in, whether it is your family budget or whether it is the Federal budget, is simply wrong. To transfer our spending in the form of debt to our children and to our grandchildren, for them to assume through higher taxes and through a lower standard of living, is simply wrong. 
The intrinsic value, though, of the balanced budget amendment 
rests on a simple point--it affects every American. It will affect how and where we spend taxpayers' dollars. It will affect the process by which those decisions are made. Moreover, it will affect the real value we place on the taxpayers' money, when we are restricted in the ways we spend it. 
The time has come for Government to learn how to work with less, how to see the citizen's money as being precious, and to permanently reduce its size so that its people's wealth can expand. I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Senate Joint Resolution 1. I speak not only for myself, but I think I speak for thousands and thousands of Arkansas voters and their families who sent me to Washington with a primary goal of balancing the Federal budget and getting our books in order. 
Arkansans, like most Americans, are hard-working, decent people with jobs and families facing constant pressure to make ends meet. Gathered around the kitchen table, these families, like so many others, pay their bills, attempt to budget for future expenses, and say no to the things they cannot afford. They act responsibly. Also, they act with the fear that a prolonged illness or unexpected job loss could push them over the edge, robbing them of financial security and destroying everything that they have worked for and saved. America's families have been forced to live within these limits. My question to the U.S. Senate is, can we ask any less of the Federal Government? 
My colleagues, we carry a heavy burden. That burden is both the annual deficit that we caused and the debt that we have created. As of February 3 of this year, our national debt stood at over $5 trillion. Whenever I hear these numbers I have to ask myself, what does that number mean, what does it mean to me, or better yet, how can we visualize numbers of this magnitude? Author David Schwartz has written a book entitled `How Much Is a Million?' It is a book to help parents explain large numbers to their children. Maybe it will help us as well. One of his examples says, `If a billion kids were to stand on each other to make a human tower, they would stand up past the moon. * * * If you stood a trillion kids on top of each other, they would pass beyond Mars and Jupiter * * * and almost as far as Saturn's rings.' In another case he says, `If you wanted to count from one to one trillion * * * it would take you about 200,000 years.' 
Let me take a moment to put this kind of massive debt into perspective for those slightly older: $5 trillion of debt translates into over $19,000 for every man, every woman, and every child in America. That is practically equal to having an additional midsized car payment without having a vehicle. The debt of an average family is more than $72,000. That could be the equivalent of owning a second residence without being able to stay there. For a family or person who owns a home, it amounts to an additional $37,000 on average tacked on to their mortgage, without raising the value of their home. For many young adults who are taking advantage of student loans to obtain a better education, the national debt can ring up $2,200 in additional costs on that loan. This significantly impacts the paycheck of the recent young college graduate who must make larger than anticipated loan payments at an entry-level salary. For those persons trying to afford a new car, the national debt means the price of that car will go up another $1,000. 
At the conclusion of 1 hour of debate, the 60 minutes that Senator Thomas has reserved, 1 hour of debate on this resolution, our country will owe roughly $29 million more than it did when we started the debate. 
Last night, the President advocated that we change the Constitution to protect victims rights, but he rejected and condemned the notion that we should amend the Constitution to ensure that our Government lives within its means. As if we were rewriting the Constitution to ensure a balanced budget, saying that is not a requirement, we should not do that. We have the authority; all we have to have is the discipline. I will sign it; you pass it. And yet in the same speech advocating that we change the Constitution to protect victims rights. 
There are those who have said that a balanced budget amendment would wreck the economy. Well, business probably more than any other part of our economy has felt the effects of our huge national debt. Government has siphoned billions of dollars in investment capital, which, in turn, restricts our economy from reaching a higher growth potential. Deficits make businesses compete with Government for money, causing interest rates to be higher than they should be. With interest rates higher than necessary and private capital formation being stifled, it is quite possible to foresee lower living standards in the future, even in this time of slow growth we have experienced. 
National growth rates of 2 to 3 percent simply are inadequate for America. Balancing the budget can mean an additional $88.2 billion of capital investment in the first 7 years that we have a balanced budget. The less money being taken by Government, the more money that is available for economic development and job growth. Even more important, we have seen evidence that our debt and annual deficits have restrained the ability to make a better life for all of us. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that deficits have kept our standard of living down by 5 percent. However, if we decide to make the choice to balance the budget by the year 2001, the General Accounting Office has stated it would lead to 
a 35-percent increase in the standard of living. Just think what that would mean in spending power to middle-class Americans. A balanced budget amendment will propel Congress to do what legislative remedies, with such words as `firewalls,' `spending ceilings,' and `lock boxes,' what all of those statutory techniques have failed to accomplish since 1968. This measure will give the impetus to set goals and make priorities without budget gimmicks which have characterized the process over the last 30 years. It will make the budget process look more like what happens with our families than the current situation. 
For most of the history of our country, the budget was balanced. Permanent deficits were viewed as intolerable. Permanent deficits were viewed as something that was wrong. Chronic deficits were unacceptable not because of the constitutional prohibition, but because of a deeply embedded moral belief that permanent deficits were simply wrong, a principle held by politicians and the general public alike. With the creation of entitlement programs in the 1960's, the proclivity of politicians to expand these popular and expensive entitlement programs have gone virtually unchecked. The intolerable increase in spending has had the inevitable result of persistent deficits and an ever expanding national debt. 
James Buchanan, a professor of economics at George Mason who testified in 1995 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, said, `The immorality of the intergenerational transfer that deficit financing represents cries out for correction.' He is so right. He calls it the `immorality of the intergenerational transfer of deficit spending.' What he calls the `immorality of intergeneration transfer' is nothing less than one generation stealing from another generation. The fundamental moral code of our Judeo-Christian tradition says `thou shall not steal.' That sets the standard. Every time we as a Government spend one dollar that we do not have, we are stealing from our children. 
From the establishment of the Republic, our Founders saw public debt not only as immoral but as the principal threat to the survival of our representative democracy. James Madison said, `I go on the principle that a public debt is a public curse and in a republican government, a greater curse than any other.' George Washington, in his farewell address, called the accumulation of debt `ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burden of which we ourselves ought to bear.' 
Indeed, the War of Independence was fought over the principle of taxation without representation. The Founders also knew that deficit spending would impose exorbitant tax rates on coming generations to pay for the debt accumulated by our own conspicuous consumption. 
My colleagues, this is the ultimate taxation without representation. When we immorally steal from our children, from our grandchildren, ensuring that they are going to face ever increasing levels of taxation without the right to have any say about it today, Mr. President, the time has come for us to stop stealing from our children and stop the chronic deficit spending by the adoption of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, sending it to the States for ratification. We must do it now. 
I thank Senator Thomas for yielding.

Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I rise today in support of America's families. It is with a deep sense of honor that I stand for the first time before this great deliberative body. As the first Republican Senator to be popularly elected from the great state of Arkansas, I believe it is fitting that my first legislative initiative be on behalf of those whom we hold most dear--the children of America's families. It is doubly fitting that I join my dear friend from our days in the House of Representatives and now Senate colleague, Rod Grams, in cosponsorship of the Family Tax Fairness Act of 1997. 
My career of public service has been grounded in principles of faith, preservation of the family and honest but less intrusive government. These tenets will be my guide post as I serve the good people of Arkansas in the United States Senate. 
In my lifetime, I have observed the precipitous decline of the economic and moral health of the American family. This decline is attributable to many causes not the least of which is the rising tax burden. As a member of the baby boomer generation, I, like all of you, have watched our 2% tax rate of the 1950's grow to 25%, nearly a 300% increase since World War II. This means that America's families send one out of every four dollars to Washington. In real terms, the average American family pays more in federal taxes than it spends on food, clothing, transportation, insurance, and recreation combined. 
What is the payback for millions of hardworking American families? It is increased crime rates, failing educational systems, intrusive government, and a very real threat to our overall quality of life by the shrinking of America's backbone--the middle class. It is my belief that over taxation is slowly destroying the middle class American family. Families are working harder and harder and taking home less and less. Measured by average after-tax per capita income, families with children are now the lowest income group in America. Their average after-tax income is below that of elderly households. It is below that of single individuals, and it is below that of couples without children. The shrinking family paycheck because of ever-higher taxes forces families with children to spend more time at work and less time at home. Less family time translates into children with less parental supervision with all of its attendant problems. 
The Family Tax Fairness Act of 1997 with a $500 tax credit for every child under the age of 18, provides the stimulus to keep our families strong. It translates into over $25 billion of tax relief each year, of which over 78 percent would directly benefit working and middle class families. I am convinced that parents, not government, can best decide how to allocate resources. Under this proposal, a family with two children would receive $1,000 to pay for clothes, college, or health insurance for the children. The Family Tax Fairness Act of 1997 is a statement by our government and our society that all our families and all of our children are valuable. 
In closing, I am reminded of the words of William Sumner in his speech, The Forgotten Man. 
`The Forgotten Man . . . delving away in patient industry supporting his family, paying his taxes, casting his vote, supporting the church and school . . . but he is the only one for whom there is no provision in the great scramble and the big divide. Such is the Forgotten Man. He works, he votes, generally he prays--but his chief business in life is to pay . . . Who and where is the Forgotten Man in this case? Who will have to pay for it all?' 
Sadly, the Forgotten Man is a metaphor for today's American family. So, while I urge support for the repeal of the death tax--the inheritance tax--that killer of the American dream . . . and while I urge support for dramatically cutting the capital gains tax rate, which both economists and experience teach will actually increase federal revenues, let us not forget the American family. 
I urge my colleagues to join Senator Grams and myself in support of the Family Tax Fairness Act of 1997. 
I thank the chair and yield the floor.
