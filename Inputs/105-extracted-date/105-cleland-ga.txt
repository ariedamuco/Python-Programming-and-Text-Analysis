Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, in the wake of final passage of S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act, I wish to emphasize my interest in the retention and reinforcement of the recklessness standard of liability and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals pleading standard in federal securities fraud cases. Securities law experts, including officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission, have recognized that the continued vitality of the federal securities laws and the health of the financial markets depend on the reaffirmation of this standard. 
It is essential that we be clear that reckless wrongdoing satisfies the scienter standard under the federal securities laws. The current standard that provides liability for reckless behavior should be explicitly reaffirmed; any suggestion that a victimized investor must establish actual knowledge by a defendant is not only legally incorrect but would undermine the integrity of our financial markets. The SEC has repeatedly stated in legal filings and Congressional testimony that the recklessness standard is critical to investor protection. Every federal appellate court that has considered this issue has held that recklessness suffices. The text of the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act did not change the scienter standard; Members of Congress understood that raising the standard would have not only a chilling effect on private actions by defrauded individuals, but on regulatory actions by the SEC. 
Since the 1995 Reform Act, there has been some disagreement in the courts about whether Congress intended to elevate the pleading standard in securities fraud class actions above the previously existing Second Circuit pleading standard. It is clear to me that the answer to the question must be `no'. I am pleased that the Senate Banking Committee Report on S. 1260, as well as the recorded colloquy on the Senate floor about the Second Circuit pleading standard, reaffirm this point. 
As I mentioned in my floor statement during debate on this legislation, I am not convinced that the federal preemption of state anti-fraud protections is a necessary step. I support the right of investors to seek legal remedies against those persons selling fraudulent securities. While I worked to streamline the regulatory process in Georgia, I opposed amendments to federal regulations that would have impaired the ability of a state to protect its investors. Here in the Senate, my focus remains the same. For this reason, I opposed S. 1260 during its initial Senate consideration. Nevertheless, if passage of this legislation is inevitable, let us at least make it absolutely clear that an investor's right to seek redress through civil litigation is not eliminated due to a failure to reaffirm the existing standard of recklessness in federal securities fraud cases.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jennifer Wardrep, one of my finest employees who has worked for me, in one capacity or another, for five years. Jennifer came to work for my press office when I was the Secretary of State of Georgia. She had recently graduated from East Carolina University where she studied journalism and political science. Jennifer had a successful career in college, working for the student newspaper and rising to become its editor. 
In the Secretary of State's office, Jennifer quickly won my respect and that of her coworkers for her hard work and writing skills. She spent many long nights working in the Georgia Capitol to make it possible for the people of Georgia to receive the news of State elections, the new Motor Voter laws and all of the important work handled by that office. Her dedication to me, and that office, is something for which I am deeply in her debt. 
In December of 1995, Jennifer left the safety of her `good government job' for the exciting but temporary life of a political campaign. Once again, Jennifer came to work for me, on my long-shot attempt to become a United States Senator. If there ever was a time when I needed a good press person, it was then. Jennifer was a huge part of a successful media campaign that let the voters of Georgia decide for themselves who was best suited to represent them in the U.S. Senate. 
I remember one time in particular when we were traveling through South Georgia talking to several newspapers and many more voters. It was late in the campaign and we were all tired and ready for the election. Jennifer kept me on message as much as humanly possible and rewarded me with candy. This creative thinking is typical of Jennifer. As she and I will both affirm, it sometimes takes innovative approaches to confine me to one message. 
I went to bed on election night not knowing for certain if I had won the race. Early the next morning, my phone rang and woke me up. It was Jennifer and she said `Good morning, Senator.' The people of Georgia had heard our message of hope and opportunity, several news organizations wanted to interview me and this was my wake-up call. Jennifer was the first person to call me `Senator.' I will never forget that moment and I want to thank her very much for that. 
After the election, I asked Jennifer to come to Washington with me where she became my Press Secretary. The tenacious media in Washington was no match for her. Although the southern hospitality of Atlanta was nothing like the rough and tumble of Washington, Jennifer's experience paid off. Jennifer quickly established good relationships with the media and helped me share with the people of Georgia the work we were doing on campaign finance reform, Georgia's defense operations and many, many more things. 
Although I have said it many times, I truly believe that I have the best staff on Capitol Hill. And I truly believe I have the best Press Secretary on Capitol Hill as well. Jennifer has decided to move on to other things and I wish her the best of luck at whatever she does, although I doubt she will need it. Jennifer has served the people of Georgia well and served me extraordinarily well. Whether it was setting up press conferences, sending out news releases, writing PSA's, or recording Internet messages, Jennifer Wardrep is an irreplaceable part of my staff and will always be my `Tiger' in the press office.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, the Internet, as an growing form of communication, commerce, and information exchange, is a powerful medium for all who are able to take advantage of the opportunities it presents. The initial version of S. 442, the Internet Tax Freedom Act, would, in my opinion, have provided this already powerful tool with even more competitive advantages. Frankly, I believed that the original version was too one-sided in aiding Internet-based businesses at the expense of other interests. However, I was very pleased with the willingness of the authors of this bill to address the concerns raised by state and local governments as well as `Main Street' business owners in such a way that I was able to support the final bill. 
The final version of S. 442 contains several positive features. Among those is the inclusion of the Hutchinson amendment, which will allow the Commission created by S. 442 to examine the impact of all types of remote sales. Every year states lose billions of dollars in revenue from remote sales, most recently via the Internet but also in catalog sales. The Hutchinson amendment, which is faithful to the recommendation of the Finance Committee, makes a proper and relevant expansion of the mandate of the Commission. 
Not all states and municipalities have imposed taxes on the Internet. However, those that have should not have their Constitutional right to impose these taxes stripped away by Congress. The grandfathering of existing taxes on electronic commerce contained in the final version of S. 442, is consistent with our federalist system and balances the needs of interstate commerce with the proper role of states and municipalities. 
Although these and other positive provisions in S. 442 allowed me to support the overall bill, I am hopeful that the initial concerns I had with S. 442 will not arise again when the three year moratorium established by the bill expires. The purpose of this temporary moratorium is to allow government and industry representatives time to work together to decide the rules for electronic commerce. However, S. 442 offers no guarantee that the moratorium will not be extended after the three year period. I supported Senator Graham's amendment that would have required a super majority to extend the moratorium, but unfortunately, it was defeated. 
There is a precedent of another `temporary' moratorium that never expired. In 1959, Congress enacted Public Law 86-272, which limited state corporate income tax collection on out-of-state corporations. Like the goal of the Commission created by S. 442, a moratorium was imposed to try to negotiate a uniform standard with regard to the tax treatment of out-of-state corporations. The results of P.L. 86-272 was an increase in litigation and a decrease in state and local tax revenue. This precedent explains state and local leaders' skepticism about a temporary Internet tax moratorium. It is my hope that when the three year moratorium expires, Congress will not extend the moratorium. The experience of P.L. 86-272 does not need to be repeated. 
I fear that a continuation of the moratorium would tilt the scales heavily in favor electronic commerce at the expense of local `Main Street' businesses. Internet sales should not receive any privileges that are not available to other forms of commerce. Business competitors of Internet-based firms should not have to experience such legalized discrimination. 
Although the use of computers will certainly continue to grow, there will always be consumers who will not have access to the Internet. If attempts are made to extend the three year moratorium, Congress will, in effect, be offering a tax break to those who can afford a computer and Internet access to the detriment of those who cannot. 
I wanted to take this opportunity to applaud the efforts that have been made to address this rapidly emerging form of trade, and I believe that the compromise version of S. 442 is an appropriate balance that will give the Commission time to make a recommendation while not greatly interfering with interstate commerce. However, I urge caution by my colleagues, when we revisit this issue in three years, that in our zeal to encourage the growth of the Internet and all the promise it offers we should not compromise the needs of our states, cities, towns, and local merchants. I pledge my efforts to achieve that goal.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, Mark Twain once said, `Get your facts first, and then you can distort them as much as you please.' There has been some distortion and misinformation about my bill, the Drug Currency Forfeitures Act, and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the facts. 
First of all, the purpose of my bill is to dismantle the fortunes of drug traffickers by helping law enforcement seize their drug profits. It is all about confiscating the money of drug dealers, drug traffickers, and drug kingpins. It is NOT about seizing the money of innocent, law-abiding citizens, as some have charged. Confiscating the money of innocent citizens violates the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, and I would oppose such an attempt with every effort at my command. That is why this legislation includes constitutional safeguards which protect innocent Americans against illegal searches and seizures. 
Mr. President, let me tell you why I introduced my bill. There have been a recent series of court cases which have handed down some very disturbing verdicts. In each case, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the court ruled against seizing the assets of drug traffickers--one of our most effective weapons in the war against drugs. Let me give you just one example. 
A traveler was stopped in an airport carrying almost $14,000 in cash. A trained drug dog responded positively to the presence of drugs on the money. When asked for an explanation, the drug courier produced a fake ID and lied about the money's source. He also had a previous drug arrest on his record. Yet despite the evidence, the court gave the money back to the trafficker. Why? The court ruled there was sufficient evidence to show that the money came from some kind of criminal activity. But the court held there was insufficient evidence to prove that the crime was drug trafficking. United States v. $13,570.00 in U.S. Currency, 1997 WL 722947 (E.D. La. 1997). 
Every year drug sales in this country generate $60 billion in drug profits. Every day drug couriers move huge quantities of this multi-billion-dollar pot out of the U.S. in loads big enough to fill suitcases, trucks, and even airplanes. This movement of drug kingpins' cash crop is the most vulnerable part of their drug operation. Yet current law allows the drug trafficker and his couriers to say nothing at all when their money is seized. That's right, Mr. President. Under the law, the drug trafficker is obliged to give no explanation at all as to where his money came from. If the government can only show that the money was involved in a crime--but can't show that it was a drug crime--the drug dealer gets his money back. 
My legislation proposes a presumption that the money is drug proceeds if certain clearly defined circumstances are present--circumstances which typically are found in drug trafficking cases: the presence of drugs or drug residue; a positive alert by a properly trained dog; packaging of the money in a suspicious and highly unusual manner; false statements made to the police; previous drug trafficking convictions. 
Let me take just a moment, Mr. President, to answer those critics who discount the positive alert by a properly trained dog. These critics say that so much of our currency is tainted with drug residue that a positive dog alert is meaningless. Yet these critics fail to take into account the scientific evidence that shows that the drug dogs are NOT alerting to the presence of cocaine--which may or may not contaminate a large fraction of all U.S. currency. Instead, the scientific evidence shows that the dogs are alerting to methyl benzoate, a highly volatile chemical by-product of the cocaine manufacturing process that remains on the currency only for a short period of time. The bottom line is that the dogs are alerting only to money that has recently, or just before packaging, been in close proximity to a significant amount of cocaine. This research explains why these dogs do not routinely alert to currency. 
To repeat: These clearly defined circumstances in my bill are safeguards to protect the innocent. More important, my bill establishes only a presumption that the money is drug money. Individuals have every opportunity to rebut the government's claim and get their money back. Criminals, however, will no longer be able to play dumb and recover their drug money without having to provide an explanation of where that money came from. 
To those critics who maintain that my bill violates the rights of innocent citizens, let me say loud and clear: My bill takes effect only AFTER a determination has been made that the money in question is from an illegal source. This is how the process works. 
A police officer or federal agent assigned to an airport task force seizes the money of a traveler based on `probable cause.' The traveler, for example, has exhibited suspicious, counter-surveillance behavior, such as signaling to seemingly unrelated travelers who, in fact, are traveling with him. He has concealed a large quantity of money in his carry-on bag along with odor-disguising items like fabric softener sheets to throw off the drug dog. He produces a fake ID and offers a false explanation for the money. Someone whose name he doesn't remember packed the bag, and he had no idea there was any money in it. 
Let me repeat: There must be probable cause for the government to seize the money. Once the money is seized, notice of the seizure must be published in the newspaper on three successive weeks and direct notice must be given, in writing, to the person from whom the money was seized as well as to any other person known to have a potential legal interest. The notice explains the procedure for filing a claim to the money. In 85 percent of all federal cases, no one files a claim. To my critics, let me repeat: In 85 percent of the cases, the individual never contests the seizure. 
If an individual does file a claim, the agency which has seized the money must refer the case to the United States Attorney, who then makes an independent determination of the merits of the case. If the U.S. Attorney does not believe the government can establish that the money was drug proceeds, the case is rejected and the money is returned. On the other hand, if the U.S. Attorney believes the case has merit, he or she must file a civil forfeiture complaint in federal district court. The claimant is granted a certain number of days to renew his claim and file an answer to the government's complaint. 
The case is then litigated in the district court. In each and every case, the burden of proof is on the government. In each and every case, the government has the burden of establishing--to the satisfaction of the district court--that there is probable cause to believe that the money is drug money and therefore subject to forfeiture. Only if the government successfully overcomes this hurdle is the case scheduled for a jury trial where the claimant is required to offer his explanation for the legitimate source of the money. If the jury accepts this explanation, and the government is unable to rebut it with admissible evidence, the claimant will prevail and will recover the money. Otherwise, the court will enter judgment for the government and order the forfeiture of the money. 
Mr. President, the federal forfeiture laws are carefully written to provide due process to the innocent and the guilty alike. My bill conforms to these high standards while closing a legal loophole that benefits only the guilty. In the court cases which my bill addresses, the cases are dismissed before the claimant ever has to go before a jury to explain the source of the money. My bill addresses this problem by creating a presumption that if certain factors are present, the money is drug proceeds, and thereby allows the case to move forward to the next stage. 
To those who have expressed concern with the concept of rebuttable presumption, let me emphasize this fact: The presumption does not lead inevitably to the forfeiture of the money. Its role is only to force the claimant to come forward with an explanation for a legitimate source of the money. Therefore, my bill in no way infringes upon a property owner's rights under law. 
To those who have expressed concern over the possible impact of my bill, let me cite these facts. In fiscal year 1995--a time period prior to most of the court decisions which have limited the use of drug asset seizures--the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service made 35,000 seizures of forfeitable property. Of the 35,000 cases, more than 85 percent were uncontested. Of the 5,250 contested cases, the U.S. Attorney declined to prosecute 3,057. Of the 2,193 complaints filed, the government lost in only 48 cases. These statistics are similar for the prior three years. There is therefore little evidence of actual abuses of drug asset forfeitures in the past, and there is even less likelihood of such abuses under the enhanced safeguards in my proposal. 
In closing, let me state once again: The Drug Currency Forfeitures Act goes after drug money only. Drug trafficking is a business, and drug traffickers are in this business for one reason--money. Their multi-billion-dollar war chests allow drug lords to have some of the world's most sophisticated airplanes, boats, and communications equipment. Because of their war chests, drug cartels possess weapons in quantities that rival the capabilities of some legitimate governments. If we want to make our streets safer, if we hope to make our children's lives drug-free, it is not enough just to apprehend the drug trafficker. Throw the drug kingpin in jail, and he continues his drug operations from behind prison walls. As evidence, just look at the leaders of the most powerful international organized crime group in history--Colombia's notorious Cali cartel. Even now, the Rodriguez-Orejuela brothers are able to run their drug trafficking business from prison through the use of private quarters and telephones. 
Critics of my proposal talk about the need to protect innocent victims. If we want to talk about innocent victims, look at the children who are being sold drugs at increasingly younger ages. Mr. President, I'm proud to be the sponsor of the Drug Currency Forfeitures Act. It hits the drug cartels where it hurts the most--their wallets. The ability of law enforcement to confiscate drug money hinges on the government's ability to prove that the money is drug proceeds, and not the proceeds of some other form of unlawful activity. 
My bill is endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. The Drug Currency Forfeitures Act closes a legal loophole that benefits only the guilty. At the same time, it upholds the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which protects the innocent against unlawful searches and seizures. I worked very closely with the Department of Justice in crafting this legislation. It is a positive--and needed--step forward, and at the appropriate time I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an invaluable member of my staff, Mike Williams, who has served as my Military Legislative Assistant since I arrived in the Senate in January 1997. Mike joined my staff after serving a great American and one of Georgia's most honored and beloved Senators, Senator Sam Nunn, where he began as an intern while attending Georgia Tech and after graduation quickly became involved in legislative matters, including military issues. After more than five years of public service, Mike will be leaving my staff after the 105th Congress adjourns to pursue other career opportunities. He will be sorely missed and not easily replaced. 
Mike's excellent assistance and invaluable experience made my transition from being Georgia's Secretary of State to a United States Senator and a member of the Senate's Armed Services Committee smooth and successful. He serves as a positive example to us all--a good person who is committed to his family and to continually improving himself. While working full-time for Senator Nunn and then myself, Mike has attended law school in the evening while still finding quality time to devote to his lovely wife Allyson and their beautiful daughter Catherine. Now in his final year of law school at Georgetown, Mike has decided to leave Capitol Hill to pursue a career in the law profession. I wish him well in all of his future endeavors and I know that he will have a lifetime of many more accomplishments and shining moments. Although Mike's invaluable contribution to my staff will be greatly missed, his daily presence in our lives will be missed even more. Mike, thank you for your years of service to me and the people of the great State of Georgia--I am very proud of all you do. You truly are a great American!

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the Republic of China's 87th Anniversary National Day on October 10, 1998. Taiwan has prospered beyond most people's wildest dreams despite its limited resources and vast population. The people of the United States have a special bond with the people of Taiwan, who have unfalteringly demonstrated to the world their commitment to democracy and democratic ideals. Taiwan is a vibrant, thriving country for the present and a model for the future--a model characterized by strong economic growth and respect for basic human rights and democratic freedoms. 
Taiwan has been and will continue to be an important partner of the United States, economically, culturally, strategically, and politically. May God bless our friends in Taiwan, including President Lee Teng-hui, Vice President Lien Chan and Taipei's Foreign Minister, Dr. Jason Hu, who have done an excellent job in leading Taiwan down the road of democracy and prosperity. Mr. President, I ask that you join me and our colleagues in congratulating the Republic of China's freedom on its 87th Anniversary National Day. I look forward to celebrating this historic event annually for many, many years to come.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry and the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, for their continuing leadership on behalf of small businesses. The legislation before the Senate, S. 3412, contains many important programs that will enable small businesses to continue to be a vital part of the nation's economy. This omnibus small business legislation is the result of bipartisan commitment to a number of worthy goals. 
Today I wish to address specifically two important initiatives that I proposed earlier in this session: the disaster mitigation pilot program and the Small Business Administration Women's Business Center authorization. I am extremely pleased that both are included in this bill. 
On June 11, 1998, Senator Kerry and I introduced the S. 2157, the Women's Business Center Authorization bill. There was broad bipartisan support for this initiative, with seventeen cosponsors. I was especially pleased when Senator Bond included an increased authorization for women's business centers in the pending bill. Funding for these important centers is increased from $8 million to $12 million in fiscal year 1999 and thereafter. 
The women's business center legislation, simply stated, recognizes the outstanding contributions that women's business centers have made to women entrepreneurs across the Nation. These centers are the only organization, nationally, which focus exclusively on entrepreneurial training for women. Increased funding will allow for new centers and subcenters to be established and for continued funding for existing centers, including the on-line women's business center. Increased funding would achieve the goal of expanding centers to all 50 States. 
On March 26, 1998, I introduced a disaster mitigation pilot program, S. 1869. This legislation would permit SBA to establish a pilot program (using up to $15 million of existing disaster funds) to provide small businesses with low interest, long-term disaster loans to finance preventive measures before a disaster hits. In response to the increasing costs and personal devastation caused by disasters, the Administration has launched an approach to emergency management that moves away from the current reliance on response and recovery to one that emphasizes preparedness. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has already established administratively a program to assist disaster-prone communities, one in every state, in developing strategies to avoid the crippling effects of natural disasters. My proposal would allow the SBA to begin a pilot program that would be limited to small businesses within those communities which are eligible to receive disaster loans after a disaster has been declared. Currently, SBA disaster loans may only be used to repair or replace existing protective devices that are destroyed or damaged by a disaster. In connection with repairs, funds may also be used to install new mitigation devices that will prevent future damage. My legislation is necessary to authorize SBA to establish this pilot program to provide mitigation loans prior to the occurrence of a disaster. 
Mr. President, I believe that this disaster mitigation program will address two areas of need for our small businesses--reducing the cost of recovery from a disaster and reducing future disaster costs for small businesses. It also addresses the opportunity for small businesses to contract work during a period when market forces haven't driven up the prices for these services, thereby ultimately reducing the cost of disaster assistance to the taxpayers. 
I thank my colleagues on the Small Business Committee for including both of these initiatives, which I think will serve the needs of so many, in this bipartisan legislation. I look forward to its prompt enactment. Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, as designated by the Senate, September 14-20, 1998, is celebrated as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week. I am pleased to take this opportunity to recognize the achievements of these fine institutions of higher education and to pay a special tribute to the ten Historically Black Colleges and Universities located in my home State of Georgia. The 104 historically black institutions of higher learning throughout the United States are cornerstones of African-American education and play an integral role in the lives of African-Americans and in American history. 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities have set a high standard for providing quality instruction and valuable, lifelong experiences to students. Though sometimes faced with adversity, historically black colleges and institutions have provided students with the opportunity to broaden their horizons and to reach their fullest potential. 
As I have mentioned, my state of Georgia has the privilege of being served by ten of these fine institutions: Albany State University, Clark Atlanta State University, Fort Valley State University, Interdenominational Theological Center, Morehouse College, The Morehouse School of Medicine, Morris Brown College, Paine College, Savannah State University, and Spelman College. 
Albany State University, the previous Albany Bible and Manual Training Institute, Georgia Normal and Agricultural College and Albany State College, was ranked by U.S. News and World Report among the top colleges and universities in the South in September 1997. In a recent special report to Black Issues In Higher Education Magazine (July 9, 1998), ASU was ranked among the top 100 producers of degrees for African Americans in three key areas--education, health professions, and computer information Science. 
Clark Atlanta State University is a comprehensive, private, urban, coeducational institution of higher education with a predominantly African American heritage. It offers undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees as well as non-degree programs to students of diverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. U.S. News and World report lists Clark Atlanta among the best universities in the United States in its 1996 `America's Best Colleges' guide. 
Fort Valley State University, founded in 1890, is a public, state and land-grant co-educational liberal arts institution located in central Georgia's Peach County. The Georgia Board of Regents designated Fort Valley State as a fully accredited University on June 12, 1996, continuing in its leadership role as the only senior college or university in the University System with a mission in all four disciplines--academics, research, extension and service. 
Interdenominational Theological Center, established in 1958, maintains its position as the nucleus of theological education for African Americans in the world. Six historic African American seminaries comprise ITC. They are: Gammon Theological Seminary (United Methodist), Charles H. Mason Theological Seminary (Church of God in Christ), Morehouse School of Religion (Baptist), Phillips School of Theology (Christian Methodist Episcopal), Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary (Presbyterian Church USA) and Turner Theological Seminary (African Methodist Episcopal). 
Morehouse College, founded in 1867 as the Augusta Institute, is a small, liberal arts college with an international reputation for producing leaders who have influenced national and world history. The institution is best known for the work of graduates such as Nobel Peace Prize laureate Martin Luther King Jr., former Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan, MacArthur Fellow Donald Hopkins, Olympian Edwin Moses, filmmaker Spike Lee, and a number of Congressmen, federal judges, and college presidents. These alumni, and a long list of other Morehouse men from one generation to the next, have translated the College's commitment to excellence in scholarship, leadership, and service into extraordinary contributions to their professions, their communities, the nation, and the world. 
The Morehouse School of Medicine became independent of Morehouse College in 1981. The Morehouse School of Medicine is a predominantly black institution established to recruit and train minority and other students as physicians and biomedical scientists committed to the primary health care needs of the underserved and is fully accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. 
Morris Brown College, founded in 1867, is a private, coeducational liberal arts college engaged in teaching and research in the arts, humanities, education, social and natural sciences. The College is committed to developing, through strong academic, continuing education and cultural enrichment programs, the skills needed to function as a literate citizen in society for persons of all socio-economic status. 
Paine College, founded in 1880, has a history tied to the history of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church and the United Methodist Church. The College was founded to establish an educational institute to train Black ministers and teachers. Throughout its history, Paine has been a distinctively Christian college. It has maintained deep concern for the quest for truth and has been resolute in blending knowledge with values and personal commitment. Paine has been historically dedicated to the preparation of holistic persons for responsible life in society. 
Savannah State University, founded in 1890, is the oldest public historically black college in the state of Georgia. SSU offers 26 undergraduate and graduate degrees in three schools--the College of Business Administration, the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences and the College of Sciences and Technology. Special programs at SSU include the Marine Sciences program and the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. 
Spelman College was founded in 1881 as the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary to increase educational opportunities for Black women in Atlanta. Spelman's mission is to help students to think objectively, critically and creatively within a moral framework and to use their talents to solve problems that are ever present in a rapidly changing and complex environment. 
The extraordinary contributions of historically black colleges and universities in educating students and in enriching our communities cannot be overstated. They are a valuable national resource which are being rightly honored for their exemplary tradition in higher education. Mr. President, please join me and our colleagues in congratulating and celebrating a rich legacy and tradition of the excellence, determination, strength, and perseverance of historically black colleges and universities.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mayor Robert L. Albritten of Dawson, Georgia on receiving the 1998 American Hometown Leadership Award, which is the only national award that recognizes leaders from small communities whose community service exhibits the highest standards of dedication, ability, creativity and leadership. 
Mayor Albritten was nominated by Dawson's Better Hometown Task Force and chosen from a field of 400 national leaders for his pacesetting efforts to save jobs at Almark Mills, a local textile plant employing 250 people that shut its doors last Fall leaving Dawson on the brink of a major unemployment problem. 
Faced with a potential devastating blow to the town of 5,000 people and following days of feverish brainstorming, late-night phone calls and hours-long meetings with community leaders, rural development experts and a local accountant, Mayor Albritten and other community leaders emerged with an audacious plan-- the plant would become a cooperative, in which each worker would be an owner, and all would have a say and a financial stake in the running of the plant. 
However, Mayor Albritten was not satisfied with just creating jobs, he also set out to better the lives of all of those living in Dawson. He changed the city seal to read `The City of Dawson, Committed to a Better Quality of Life for All.' 
Mayor Robert Albritten has been an innovator and leader, and his determination is truly commendable. He has devoted countless hours of his time and energy to improve the town of Dawson and to better the lives of all of its citizens, never hesitating to help in any way he could. He has not only led the people of Dawson, but he has inspired them. His efforts have also been recognized by having the Robert L. Albritten Neighborhood Community Center named in his honor. 
In addition to his endless work on behalf of the citizens of Dawson, Mayor Albritten continues his work as a funeral service practitioner. He and his wife Arna have three daughters, Andrea, Alisha and Ariana. 
Mr. President, I ask that you join me and our colleagues in recognizing and honoring Mayor Robert L. Albritten for his remarkable achievements and accomplishments as a citizen and as a leader which have culminated with his selection as the 1998 American Hometown Leadership recipient. Mayor Albritten is truly a remarkable man and a first-rate American richly deserving of such an honor.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Zachary Fisher, who on Monday, September 14, 1998 will be presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. 
The medal, which is the highest honor given to civilians by the President, is awarded annually to individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the security or national interest of the United States or to world peace, or those who have made a significant public or private accomplishment. 
Zach and his wife, Elizabeth, have always felt strongly about the young men and women who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. During WW II Elizabeth served in the USO, entertaining thousands of troops while they were away from home. Zach, unable to serve because of a leg injury sustained in a construction accident, assisted the U.S. Coast Guard in the construction of coastal defenses. 
Although still active in his family's construction company, Fisher Brothers, he has devoted his time and energy to his country and bettering the lives of Americans. In 1978 he founded the Intrepid Museum Foundation, in an effort to save the historic and battle-scarred aircraft carrier Intrepid from scrapping. Through his efforts the vessel became the foundation of the Intrepid Sea Air Space Museum, which opened in New York City in 1982. 
Through the Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher Armed Services Foundation, Zach has pledged to do all he can in support of our nation's military and their families, and to offer new opportunities to our children, such as through the educational programs at Intrepid, and as part of the Fisher House Program, to build homes for families of hospitalized military personnel. 
His newest effort is the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation, founded in 1995 to fund research in, and work towards a cure for Alzheimer's disease. In partnership with David Rockefeller, Chairman of the Board of The Rockefeller University in New York, a new research center has been founded to help develop a cure for this debilitating disease. 
Zach is also involved in many other charitable causes, including the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation, the Coast Guard Foundation, the Navy League, the Jewish Institute of National Security Affairs, the George C. Marshall Foundation, the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, the Reagan Presidential Library, the United Jewish Appeal, and many other organizations. 
In addition to this year's Presidential Citizens' Medal, Zach has received the 1995 Presidential Citizens Medal, presented by President Clinton, and the Volunteer Action Award, presented by President Ronald Reagan. 
Zachary Fisher truly exemplifies what it means to be a patriotic American, and continues to strengthen our Nation and improve the lives of many Americans. Mr. President, I ask that you join me and our colleagues in recognizing and honoring Zachary Fisher on many years of worth-while work and achievements which have culminated with the honor of receiving the 1998 Presidential Medal of Freedom. Zach Fisher is truly a remarkable man and a first-rate American deserving of such an honor.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, there have been a series of recent cases in which courts have ruled against one of law enforcement's most effective anti-drug tools--asset forfeiture. Just consider: 
Law enforcement agents at an airport found almost $50,000 wrapped inside a pair of jeans. A drug dog responded positively to the presence of narcotics on the money, and the traveler, when confronted by the agents, produced a fake driver's license and offered other false evidence. United States v. $49,576.00 in U.S. Currency, l16 F.3d 425 (9th Cir. 1997). 
In another instance, narcotics agents found $30,000 wrapped in bundles and stashed under the seat of a car. Despite the courier's demonstrably false explanation of the source of the money, the court nevertheless found insufficient evidence to establish probable cause for forfeiture. United States v. U.S. Currency, $30,060.00, 39 F.3d 1039 (9th Cir. 1994). 
These are but two in a series of cases in which the courts found circumstantial evidence sufficient to establish that the money was derived from some form of criminal activity, but insufficient to establish that the illegal activity involved drug trafficking. The courts therefore ruled that the money seized was not subject to forfeiture, and the proceeds were returned to the trafficker. See also United States v. $13,570.00 in U.S. Currency, 1997 WL 722947 (E.D. La. 1997) (seizure of cash at airport lacked probable cause despite dog sniff, evasive answers, fake ID, courier profile, and prior drug arrest); United States v. $14,876.00 in U.S. Currency, 1997 WL 722942 (E.D. La. 1997) (same); United States v. $40,000 in U.S. Currency, 999 F. Supp. 234 (D.P.R. 1998) (dog sniff, drug courier profile, quantity of currency and evasive answers are not sufficient to establish probable cause where government fails to establish any connection between claimant and any drug trafficker). 
Mr. President, these court decisions are coming at a time when drug sales in this country are generating $60 billion in illegal proceeds every year. Most of this drug money finds its way to drug kingpins in Mexico and Colombia. And the drugs find their way to Americans of all ages and walks of life. The consequences are devastating. Substance abuse is now the single largest preventable cause of death in this country, with illegal drugs and alcohol killing 120,000 Americans each year. 
It's an enemy that respects neither class nor age group. High school athletes, runaways, soccer players, gang members, and class valedictorians use and sell drugs. Nationwide, the percentage of teens reporting illegal drug use has doubled over the last 5 years. And now the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reports that teen drug use rose in 1997, led by increasing marijuana smoking among teenagers who view it as a low-risk `soft drug.' It is no wonder that in survey after survey, Americans are reporting that illegal drugs top their list of national concerns. 
In recent testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, a top official at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) painted a chilling portrait of the powerful threat to the United States posed by international drug organizations. He said, and I quote, `These individuals, from headquarters located outside the U.S., influence the choices that many Americans make about where to live, or where they send their children to school. The drugs, and the attendant violence which accompanies the drug trade, have reached into every American community and, in essence, have robbed many Americans of the dreams they once cherished.' 
These organized crime leaders are sophisticated and possess the power that comes with unlimited resources. Because they are worth billions of dollars, these drug lords have at their disposal some of the world's most technically advanced airplanes, boats, radar, and communications equipment. They possess weapons in quantities that, DEA testified, `rival the capabilities of some legitimate governments.' These drug kingpins send thousands of couriers into the United States who answer to them on a daily basis via faxes, cellular phones, or pagers. 
Since the disruption of the notorious Cali cartel leadership, we know that traffickers from Mexico have joined together with Colombian traffickers in an emerging alliance which has largely taken over U.S. heroin distribution from Asian organizations and is now producing some of the world's most potent heroin. The manufacture of the vast majority of cocaine in South America is still under the control of the Colombian cartels, which use commercial maritime vessels, containerized cargo and private aircraft to transport the cocaine from their laboratories in the jungles of southeast Colombia through Mexico and the Caribbean into U.S. border points of entry. In fact, 50 to 60 percent of all the cocaine, as well as 25 percent of the heroin and 80 percent or more of the meth coming into the United States, are transported into our country through the U.S.-Mexico border. 
The DEA testified that the influence of Colombian trafficking organizations in the Caribbean is `overwhelming.' Several Colombian drug syndicates have set up command and control bases in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and use the Caribbean Basin to ferry tons of cocaine into the United States each year. According to the DEA, seizures of 500 to 2,000 kilos of cocaine in the Caribbean are now commonplace. Unlike the monopoly-like rule of the Cali cartel, many of the new Colombian cartels have chosen to franchise a large portion of their wholesale heroin and cocaine operations. As a result, criminals from the Dominican Republic have now become the dominant force in the wholesale cocaine and heroin trade on the East Coast of the United States. 
In addition to heroin and cocain, methamphetamine has become a growing threat within our borders. Methamphetamine trafficking, which until recently had been stopped west of the Mississippi River, is aggressively moving eastward and is now rapidly challenging cocaine as the primary focus of illegal drug trafficking in Georgia and other eastern seaboard States. According to the DEA Atlanta Field Division, Washington may soon declare Atlanta the meth capital of the Southeast. 
During February alone, DEA seized almost 90 pounds of methamphetamine in metropolitan Atlanta. Ten pounds of the drug was seized from passengers on buses originating in Texas and California. Acting on a tip, DEA agents found another 25 pounds stashed in hidden compartments in a vehicle. And law enforcement agents apprehended two Los Angeles passengers at Hartsfield Airport who had smuggled 20 pounds of meth into the State. These drugs are being ferried into my State by couriers employed by Mexican trafficking organizations operating out of Mexico and California. DEA has determined that a number of its recent meth seizures in Georgia are directly linked to the AMEZCUA drug trafficking organization--one of Mexico's principal drug cartels. 
The amounts of money generated by these illegal drug transactions are staggering. The DEA reported that one Mexican drug syndicate forwards $20 to $30 million to Colombia for each major drug operation, and makes tens of millions of dollars in profits each week. Moving this money from Mexico to Colombia, or from the U.S. to Mexico, is a relatively simple matter. The most popular method is to ship the currency in bulk by courier or cargo, or transport it overland or by air. Oftentimes, the same vehicle or even the same courier that originally transported the drugs into the United States will carry the drug proceeds out. 
It was not long ago that a Customs investigation made front page headlines. Three of Mexico's largest banks were indicted by the U.S. for laundering hundreds of millions of dollars in drug money from this country. The three-year sting was unprecedented on two counts. This was the largest money laundering case in the history of U.S. law enforcement. And it was the first time ever that Mexican banks and bank officials have been directly linked to laundering U.S. drug profits. 
The sting resulted in the arrest of 70 people, including 14 Mexican banking officials. Thirty-five million dollars in illegal drug proceeds was seized immediately. One hundred and twenty-two million dollars more is expected to be recovered from over 100 bank accounts frozen in this country and in Europe. While unprecedented, this operation netted only a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated $60 billion in illegal proceeds reaped from U.S. drug sales each year. Like most of the drug proceeds, this money was earmarked for drug lords in Mexico and Colombia. In this case, Mexican bankers allegedly aided the Juarez cartel in Mexico and the Cali cocaine and heroin syndicate in Colombia. 
If we ever expect to make in-roads in the so-called `war on drugs,' it is not enough just to apprehend the drug trafficker. We must seize his assets as well. Let me give just one example. The Rodriguez-Orejuela brothers in Colombia once ran the most powerful international organized crime group in history. Based on evidence supplied by the U.S. Government, Miguel Rodriguez-Orejuela has been sentenced to 21 years in prison, although it is expected that he will serve only 12. Last year his brother Gilberto was sentenced to 10 1/2 years in prison on drug trafficking charges. Even now, the Rodriguez-Orejuela brothers are able to run their drug trafficking business from prison through the use of private quarters and telephones. They are by no means the exception. Last year the Colombia National Police took control of four maximum security prisons from the Bureau of Prisons, in an effort to halt jailed traffickers from continuing their illegal operations from behind prison walls. In the final analysis, the only way to destroy the drug cartels is to hit them where it hurts the most--their pocket books. 
The transportation and transmission (by electronic means) of drug proceeds are enormous 
problems for law enforcement, but they also present law enforcement with an enormous opportunity. Because drug proceeds in the form of cash occupy much more space than the drugs themselves--often filling suitcases, vehicles, and even airplanes--the movement of the cash is often the most vulnerable part of the drug operation. Indeed, law enforcement agents are frequently successful in intercepting such cash shipments by stopping couriers at airports, opening containers at Customs checkpoints, and encountering cars stuffed with cash during routine traffic stops. 
However, the ability of law enforcement to confiscate the money--and thus break the drug trafficking cycle--hinges on the government's ability to establish that the money is, in fact, drug proceeds, and not the proceeds of some other form of unlawful activity. Therefore, today the distinguished chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, Senator Grassley, and I are introducing the Drug Currency Forfeitures Act. Our bill enhances the ability of law enforcement agents to interdict and confiscate the huge quantities of drug money that are being moved through our airports, up and down our major highways, through our ports, and in and out of financial institutions here and abroad--while at the same time it upholds Fourth Amendment constitutional protections against illegal searches and seizures. Specifically, our bill would create a `rebuttable presumption' that money is subject to forfeiture as drug proceeds in cases involving drug couriers carrying large amounts of cash through drug transit areas, and in cases involving international money laundering. The presumption would apply if any of the following factors is established by the government. 
Factor one: There is more than $10,000 in currency being transported in one of the transit places commonly used by drug traffickers--for example, an airport, an interstate highway, or port of entry--and any of the following circumstances commonly associated with the transportation of drug proceeds exists: the money is packaged in a highly unusual manner; or the courier makes a false statement to a law enforcement officer or inspector; or the money is found in close proximity to drugs; or a properly trained dog gives a positive alert. 
I note here that there has been much criticism of the use of drug dogs to interdict drug money, on the ground that so much currency now in circulation in the U.S. is tainted with drug residue that the drug dog's positive alert is meaningless. Let me say, however, that recent scientific research has refuted this notion and indeed supports the proposition that a drug dog's alert to currency is highly relevant in a forfeiture case. A study by Dr. Kenneth Furton, Director of the Criminalistics Program in the Chemistry Department at Florida International University, has established that a properly trained drug dog does not alert to the cocaine residue on currency, but alerts instead to methyl benzoate--a highly volatile chemical by-product of the cocaine manufacturing process that remains on the currency only for a short period of time. Thus, even if it is true that a high percentage of our currency is contaminated with cocaine residue, the drug dogs are alerting only to money that has recently, or just before packaging, been in close proximity to a significant amount of cocaine. See K.G. Furton, Y.L. Hsu, N. Alvarez and P. Lagos, `Novel Sample Preparation Methods and Field Testing Procedures Used to Determine the Chemical Basis of Cocaine Detection by Canines,' Forensic Evidence and Crime Science Investigation, Proc. SPIE 2941, 56-62 (1997). I am attaching to my remarks an article describing Dr. Furton's work. 
Factor two: The property subject to forfeiture was acquired during a period of time when the person who acquired it was engaged in a drug trafficking offense, and there is no other likely source for the money. I note that this presumption already exists in criminal forfeiture cases. See 21 U.S.C. 853(d). 
Factor three: The property was involved in a transaction that occurred, in part, in a bank secrecy jurisdiction or was conducted by, to or through a shell corporation. These two factors appear repeatedly in cases involving international money laundering and therefore are highly indicative of illegal money laundering activity. However, to ensure that the presumption is focused narrowly on the problem this bill is designed to address, it would apply only where the money was being moved in or out of one of the countries the President has listed as a `major drug-transit country,' a `major illicit drug producing country,' or a `major money laundering country,' all of which are defined terms in the Foreign Assistance Act. 
Factor four: Any person involved in the transaction has been convicted of a drug trafficking or money laundering offense, or is a fugitive from prosecution for such an offense. This factor reflects the obvious fact that the movement of money by a convicted drug trafficker, money launderer or fugitive is highly likely to involve drug proceeds. 
The existence of any one of these four factors would be sufficient--by itself, or in some cases, in combination with the facts and circumstances which led to the seizure of the money--to establish probable cause to believe that the money represents drug proceeds, and if left unrebutted, would be sufficient to establish that the money is subject to forfeiture under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 881(a)(6), or the Money Laundering Control Act, 18 U.S.C. 981(a)(1), by a preponderance of the evidence. The owner of the money, of course, would be free to rebut the presumption by submitting admissible evidence that the money was derived from a legitimate source, and the government would have to respond either by impeaching the reliability of such evidence, or by offering admissible evidence of its own to support the forfeiture of the money. See United States v. $129,727.000 U.S. Currency, 129 F.3d 486 (9th Cir. 1997). In this way, legitimate owners of untainted money will be protected. However, drug traffickers and money launderers will no longer be able to rely on the ambiguities inherent in the movement of cash and electronic funds--as well as the ambiguities inherent in the standard of proof in civil forfeiture law--to win the release of their ill-gotten gains without having to come forward with any evidence whatsoever. 
On June 22, the Supreme Court handed down a highly controversial decision which is certain to have far-reaching ramifications on U.S. drug interdiction policy. That sharply divided ruling involved the case of Hosep Bajakajian, who had attempted to take $357,000 in undeclared cash to Syria, and who had lied about the amount of money he had with him when questioned by a Customs inspector. By ruling that the federal government cannot seize the money of a person trying to carry funds out of the country when that individual fails to declare it, unless the government can show it is tainted money, the High Court's decision may very well reinforce the recent lower court decisions against forfeiture--a critically important weapon in our drug interdiction arsenal. Our bill would address these adverse court decisions by providing needed statutory guidance on the important and contentious issue of property subject to seizure. 
Our bill has been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. I hope that my colleagues will support this bill.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I am pleased to offer an important piece of legislation designed to address a critical need of Georgia's veterans and their families. 
One of the greatest honors our country provides for a veteran's service is the opportunity to be buried in a national cemetery. It is logical that a veteran's family would want to have the grave site of their loved one close by. They want to be able to visit to place flowers or a folded American flag by the headstone of their father, mother, sister or brother. Georgia veterans' families deserve such consideration. The establishment of a new veterans national cemetery in the Atlanta metropolitan area is one of my highest legislative priorities. 
The current veterans population in Georgia is estimated to be nearly 700,000, with over 400,000 residing in the Metro Atlanta area. Our state currently has two cemeteries designated specifically for veterans, in Marietta and Andersonville. Marietta National Cemetery has been full since 1970, and Andersonville National Historic Cemetery is located in southwest Georgia, at a considerable distance from most of the state's veterans population. 
The large population of veterans' families in Metro Atlanta and North Georgia is not being served, and we need to change that. 
Abraham Lincoln once said: `All that a man hath will he give for his life; and while all contribute of their substance the soldier puts his life at stake, and often yields it up in his country's cause. The highest merit, then, is due to the soldier.' 
We owe it to our veterans and their families to provide a national veterans cemetery close to their home. 
I have been pursuing this matter for over 20 years, since I was head of the Veterans' Administration, now called the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Nationally, there are over 300,000 vacancies in national cemeteries for veterans, but in Georgia, there are no such vacancies. The only option these veterans have is burial in Andersonville, a national historic cemetery which is operated by the National Park Service, not the VA, and is more than 100 miles away from the Metro Atlanta area. This deeply concerns me, especially when one considers that Georgia has the highest rate of growth in terms of military retirees in the Nation, and that the majority of these veterans reside in Metro Atlanta. We really must do better for our veterans. 
In 1979, when I was head of the VA, our studies documented that the Atlanta metropolitan area was the area having the largest veterans population in the country without a national cemetery. Later that same year, I announced that Metro Atlanta had been chosen as the site for a new VA cemetery, which was to be opened in late 1983. The Atlanta location was chosen after an exhaustive review of many sites, including consideration of environmental, access, and land use factors, and most importantly, the density of veterans population. Unfortunately, the Reagan Administration later withdrew approval of the Atlanta site. Over the years since then, Atlanta has repeatedly been one of the top areas in the United States most in need of an additional national cemetery. 
Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today is simple. First, it requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish a national cemetery in the Atlanta metropolitan area not later than January 1, 2000. Second, it requires the Department to consult with appropriate federal, state, and local officials to determine the most suitable site. Finally, the bill further requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to report to Congress on the establishment of the cemetery, including an estimate on its cost and a timetable for completion of the cemetery. 
I believe this bill is a necessary first step toward the eventual establishment of a national cemetery to meet the needs of Atlanta's veterans and their families. Admittedly, several factors must be resolved before the cemetery can be established. A site must be found and funding must be made available. However, we must move swiftly to resolve this problem so that a critical element of our commitment to the Nation's veterans can be met. 
I am hopeful that the Senate will take favorable action on my bill early in the next Congress. I want to thank my colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, for joining me in this important effort, and Representative Barr for sponsoring the companion bill in the other body.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to salute Georgia's beloved Varsity Restaurant for 70 years of prospering business and never-ending dedication to its customers and employees. People have come from all around the world simply for a sampling of the Varsity's great food and down home hospitality. 
The Varsity was founded by Frank Gordy in 1928. As the world's largest drive-in, the Varsity's hot dogs, chili dogs, hamburgers, chili burgers, onion rings, french fries, and fried pies are the best in the world. The Varsity also sells more Coca-Cola than any other single outlet in the world. Whether you get your `dogs' at Atlanta's North Avenue Varsity, the Gwinnett Varsity off Jimmy Carter Blvd., the Varsity Jr. on Lindbergh Drive or the Varsity on Broad Street in Athens you are guaranteed to go back for more. 
The menu is extensive and the Varsity's volume is legendary. Two miles of hot dogs, a ton of onions, 2500 pounds of potatoes, and 5,000 fried pies are served every day. Six 50 gallon pots of chili are made from scratch and, like all specialty items, are prepared from original recipes. Varsity orange is piped from the kitchen to faucets at the serving counter and the popular frosted version is also on tap. 
Every time I come home to Atlanta from Washington, D.C., stopping by the Varsity is a must on my agenda. In fact, it is often my first stop after leaving the airport. All Georgians can attest that the Varsity's heavy weight, chili steak, frosted orange or fried pies are unlike any other food in the world. I cannot count the number of meals I have eaten at this Atlanta institution, but the memories of dining at the Varsity are endless. 
Mr. President, I ask that you join me, our colleagues, and the entire Gordy family in recognizing 70 years of mouth-watering food and fond memories, and in wishing the entire Varsity family many more successes in the future.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to add a few remarks concerning S. 314, the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act of 1998. I understand that under this measure, each federal government agency will be required to annually publish an inventory of governmental activities that are not inherently governmental in nature. 
Under S. 314, agencies will retain discretion to determine whether an activity is inherently governmental or commercial, and private industry will be given the option to challenge that decision. An agency may also decide that an activity is inherently governmental, but nonetheless pursue outsourcing. This latter practice can be continued and is encouraged by S. 314. For example, I would point my colleagues to the practices of the General Services Administration (GSA), the agency charged with managing all federal personal and real property--including the disposal of property no longer needed by the government, but desired by private consumers. 
Three years ago, an Arthur Anderson study concluded that the auctioning function is inherently governmental to GSA's mission. Nevertheless, GSA has increasingly outsourced this function to the private sector. 
Today's legislation in no way discourages the federal government's reliance on private industry--particularly, where, as in the case of GSA, a reputable commercial property disposal industry is established and no federal jobs or careers are displaced or otherwise placed at risk. Moreover, auctioning by commercial companies will yield a greater return on the government's investment due to the utilization of commercial incentives and practices. Under Office of Management and Budget Circular Number A-76, agencies are already required to maintain and update a baseline inventory of activities that could be performed by the private sector. S. 314 would largely codify current administrative policy.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the many accomplishments of Christine Jacobs of Norcross, Georgia. Chris is the President, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Theragenics Corporation which markets, sells and distributes the FDA-licensed medical device TheraSeed for treating cancer. 
She has had many remarkable accomplishments during her career, but today I would like to call attention to yet another important milestone. On August 6, 1998 Chris will switch Theragenics from the NASDAQ exchange, which the company has been trading on publicly since 1986, to the New York Stock Exchange. Chris will become the first female CEO to enroll a company on the New York Stock Exchange. She will also be ringing the bell to open the exchange that morning. 
Chris Jacobs is truly a remarkable and successful business-savy member of the Georgia business community. She also dedicates time to civic and medical organizations in Georgia including the Georgia Bio-Medical Partnership, the Board of Councilors of the Carter Center, the State's Small Business Taskforce and the Georgia Chamber of Commerce. 
Chris Jacobs possesses the tenacity and vision that has changed the world as we have known it and paved the road to the next millennium in regard to medical treatment. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in honoring the innumerable achievements of Chris Jacobs and her work at Theragenics, and wish her luck and much success on the New York Stock Exchange. She proves that if we can perceive it we can achieve it--Chris will continue to rewrite history and achieve unending successes.

Senators Inouye and Stevens have done an outstanding job in encouraging the Department of Defense to take full advantage of the opportunities provided by great advances in telecommunications technology, particularly with respect to distance learning. 
This bill contains funding for distance learning programs for the Marine Corps, and a new initiative for the Army National Guard. In particular, the National Guard initiative would create a distance learning network to reduce the cost of training soldiers, enhance readiness and furthering community development. The Subcommittee on Defense has a demonstrated its support for these and a number of other initiatives underway.

Mr. CLELAND. As the Ranking Member of the Personnel Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I believe I can report that our Subcommittee is also very supportive of distance learning initiatives. We are keenly aware of the advantages of distance learning. As you know, Mr. President, many of our military personnel are expected to available for deployment at a moments notice. Others are deployed around the world where they do not have ready access to educational opportunities. Rapid developments in technology have enabled them to continue in their educational development, even while deployed. 
The ability to continue in one's educational pursuits is a quality of life issue that is not necessarily always at the top of a soldier's list. However, many military personnel are only able to pursue higher education by leaving the military. I believe the maintenance of a viable distance learning program for higher education could be a useful retention mechanism to keep highly motivated individuals in the service.

Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator. I am particularly proud of one such program which is managed by the Georgia College and State University. The Distance Education Unit and the Department of Government there were recently awarded a contract by the Navy to provide two graduate courses aboard the USS Carl Vinson which is deployed in the Pacific Ocean. The courses use two-way video and audio which links educators at the school with students on board the Carl Vinson. We all knew that aircraft carriers were small cities, but this Senator was pleasantly surprised to see that sailors could take graduate level courses while at sea.

Mr. CLELAND. That is a very good question. I am told that more than 50 percent of military personnel reentering civilian life either change or lose their jobs in the first year after leaving the military. Given this, I believe we should consider providing opportunities for job training and placement for active-duty service members nearing separation or retirement from service without regard to their duty locations. 
Clayton College and State University has developed a program that could serve as a worthwhile demonstration project to demonstrate how technology can be utilized to provide pre-separation training for civilian jobs to military personnel. The program would provide training via the Internet and other technology to active-duty personnel at their duty locations for specific, existing job opportunities which would be available upon their separation from the military. The program would then link these personnel to these specific jobs ensuring that when the leave the military, employment is available. 
I am not immediately aware of any initiatives underway that would offer similar opportunities. It is my view that we should encourage the Department of Defense to explore such initiatives, perhaps in conjunction with the Department of Veterans Affairs.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am pleased today to announce that I have added my name as an original co-sponsors of the Low Sulfur Fuel Act of 1998 and to express my reasons for supporting this important legislation. I would first like to thank my colleague from New York, Senator Moynihan, for his authorship of this measure and his leadership on this issue. The bill establishes a national, year-round cap on gasoline sulfur levels, and would impose a reduction of sulfur content in gasoline from 300 parts per million (ppm) to 40 ppm within two years from the date of enactment. 
High sulfur levels in gasoline increase vehicle emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbons (HC) which in turn produce higher levels of particulate matter (PM) and contribute to ground level ozone. Reducing sulfur content levels to 40 ppm has been shown to reduce Nitrogen Oxides by 51 percent, Carbon Monoxide by 40 percent, and Hydrocarbons by 24 percent. Essentially, the sulfur in gasoline inhibits the catalyst in an automobile from doing its job--which is to reduce the emissions of the aforementioned pollutants. Sulfur is a contaminant only and does not in any way enhance engine performance. 
There are two compelling reasons which led me to support this bill: First, helping our states attain the health requirements set forth by the Clean Air Act by providing them with a viable tool for reducing NOx and CO emissions; and second, updating our gasoline to keep pace with other industrialized nations thereby keeping our automotive fleet competitive in the international marketplace. 
In my home state of Georgia, the Metro Atlanta area has experienced extensive difficulties in complying with the standards set forth by the Clean Air Act. In a recent attempt to meet these standards, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR), has voted to implement reduced sulfur content in fuel. The rule would require gasoline in the 25 county area surrounding Atlanta to be reduced to 30 ppm by 2003. Georgia is only the second state, after California, to take such innovative steps to meet air quality goals. In my review of this bill, I sent a copy to Harold Reheis, Director of the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD), an agency of the Georgia DNR for his comments. In his response, which I will ask unanimous consent to add as part of the Record after my statement, Mr. Reheis states that the Moynihan bill would `result in a reduction in air pollutants statewide and nationwide.' Further, he added that this bill `could help prevent ozone nonattainment problems in other urban areas of Georgia like Augusta, Columbus, and Macon, which all could have difficulty meeting the tighter federal ozone standards adopted by the USEPA last year.' I encourage all my colleagues to contact their State Environmental Agencies to request their input on this matter. 
Relating to the second point in support of the bill, the U.S. must maintain our innovative and forward thinking approach and support this measure because other countries, such as Japan, Egypt, Thailand, and every member of the European Union have already required similar caps on the sulfur content of their gasoline. Thus, in order for us to compete with these and other countries, we must take this extremely valuable step. California has already taken such action and now we have the opportunity to send a message to the rest of the world, that we, as a nation, are committed to cleaner, more fuel efficient gasoline. Further, we should signify that we are committed to ensuring that our auto industry and the U.S. consumer are equipped with the infrastructure necessary to take advantage of the emerging market for new, innovative, less polluting automobiles. 
There is a real possibility that if the U.S. does not take this action, we would fall behind the rest of the industrialized world--a position that the US should never be in--and become the dumping ground for higher sulfur level fuels--making it more difficult to shift to the lower sulfur fuels and inhibiting U.S. automakers from producing and U.S. consumers from purchasing, cleaner and more fuel efficient technologies. 
The crux of this issue is that reducing sulfur content in gasoline to 40 ppm, year round, is a viable, cost-effective tool to dramatically reduce pollutants which cause high levels of Particulate Matter as well as Ozone and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill in honor of an American patriot, Lieutenant Henry Ossian Flipper, on whose behalf I offer this legislation for the designation of the Lieutenant Henry O. Flipper Station, a postal station being constructed in Thomasville, Georgia. 
It is an honor for me to highlight the contributions of this courageous American. Born in 1856, in Thomasville, Georgia, Lieutenant Flipper was the first African-American to graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1877. 
Lieutenant Flipper had a distinguished career as an Army officer. His first assignment to frontier duty was with the Tenth Cavalry at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The Tenth, along with its sister unit, the Ninth Cavalry unit, were responsible for facilitating the movement of pioneers wishing to settle in the Western frontier. The African-American members of these two units became known as `Buffalo Soldiers.' During his tenure at Fort Sill, Lieutenant Flipper ingeniously engineered a drainage system to eliminate stagnant malarial ponds and swamps created during the rainy season. This effort made a significant contribution to improving the health of the Post, and the ditch, christened `Flipper's Ditch,' is now a historic landmark. 
Lieutenant Flipper was instrumental in the successful 1880 campaign against Mescalero Apache Chief Victorio, an escapee from the military authorities in New Mexico. Facing a judicial sentence for murder in 1879, Victorio was able to escape, gather his forces and begin a rampage throughout New Mexico and Texas. Through tough terrain and logistical challenges, the soldiers of the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry were able to push Victorio into Mexico where he was killed by the Mexican Army. 
It is very timely that we commemorate Lieutenant Flipper since this year is the fiftieth anniversary of the racial integration of the military. This action marked a historic change which has led to significant progress in eliminating racial barriers. Lieutenant Flipper's legacy is that of a pioneer in confronting the challenges of racial strife who paved the way for this evolution. Although Lieutenant Flipper left the military in 1882, he was able to prove to America that African-Americans possessed the quality of military leadership. 
After the end of his military service in 1882, Lieutenant Flipper continued a very distinguished career, applying his surveying and engineering skills as a civil and mining engineer on the frontiers of the Southwest and Mexico. He became the first African-American to gain prominence in the engineering profession. 
Historical accounts depict the solid perseverance of Lieutenant Flipper. He confronted racial bias demonstrating unflinchingly strong character and intellect. In a book entitled `An Officer and a Gentlemen,' historian Steve Wilson is credited with compiling a list of `firsts' for an African-American which were achieved by Lieutenant Flipper: Military Academy graduate, cavalry officer, surveyor, cartographer, civil and mining engineer, translator, interpreter, inventor, editor, author, special agent for the Justice Department, personal confident and advisor to a Senator, and pioneer in the oil industry. 
In a ceremony in 1977, Lieutenant General Sidney B. Berry, the United States Military Academy's Superintendent, praised Lieutenant Flipper's memory, stating that, `there was a strength and gentleness that transcended any bad treatment Flipper received. He was a strong and gentle man.' Lieutenant Flipper was a pioneer for civil rights in the military and in the civilian community. Although he had a very successful civilian life, Lieutenant Flipper always considered himself first and foremost an Army officer. 
I join the residents of Thomasville in this quest of the post office designation in honor of Lieutenant Flipper. Not only is this hero one of Georgia's own, Lieutenant Flipper has earned the respect of a grateful Nation. The measure I am submitting today will give him this well-deserved recognition.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor two fallen heroes--U.S. Capitol Police Officer J.J. Chestnut and U.S. Capitol Police Special Agent John Gibson--who gave their lives to protect us. When I say `us,' I do not refer only to members of Congress, to the tourists who visited the Capitol last Friday, or to staff members working that afternoon, I refer to all Americans. J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson gave their lives to protect our house, the people's house, and our freedom. 
J.J. Chestnut, 58, joined the Capitol Police force in 1980, following 20 years of service in the United States Air Force. He earned numerous commendations and awards for both his military and police service, including a Vietnam Service Medal, the Bronze Star for Meritorious military service and countless letters of appreciation from citizens and staff for assistance provided and attention to duty. Officer Chestnut is survived by his wife, Wen Ling, and five children. 
John Gibson, 42, also joined the Capitol Police force in 1980, and also earned numerous commendations. In 1988, Gibson was commended for going to the aid of a citizen, and saving their life by administering CPR. Special Agent Gibson is survived by his wife, Evelyn, and three children. 
It is horribly ironic to me that one of the fallen officers, J.J. Chestnut, was a Vietnam Veteran who survived combat only to fall at the hand of a fellow American. As a veteran he served his country so that we could all have our freedom, a freedom which the gunman who walked into the United States Capitol last Friday and opened fire, did not understand, did not honor and certainly did not respect. 
In 1862, Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote: `It is natural enough to suppose that the center and heart of America is the Capitol.' He stated that the Capitol's combination of dignity, harmony, and utility made it a fit embodiment of the highest traits of our nation. A year later, Sculptor Thomas Crawford's 19 1/2 foot, 7 1/2 ton Statue of Freedom was lifted and placed atop the Capitol Dome. 
Nearly every President since Andrew Jackson has been inaugurated on its steps. The Capitol has hosted a cast of American legends, as great Senators and great members of the House have presided and debated in each of two houses over the years, including John Calhoun, Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, Robert Lafollette, George Norris, Richard Russell, John F. Kennedy, Sam Rayburn, Carl Vinson, Robert Byrd. 
The Capitol has also been home to so many milestones in American history. The Capitol was where the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964, and where women were granted the right to vote. It was where war was declared after the invasion of Pearl Harbor following upon the famous `Day of Infamy' speech. It was where the Social Security Act was enacted, and where legislation was passed to limit child labor. 
More than anything, our Capitol has stood as a symbol of our democracy, of our liberty, and of our freedom since President George Washington laid the cornerstone for the building in 1793. 
Let us not let the actions of the gunman last Friday threaten our freedom, or our belief in our democracy. Instead, let us focus on the heroic actions of officers J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson, who last week gave the ultimate sacrifice for their country. 
I am reminded of a passage from Thucydides' `Funeral Oration of Pericles':  
So they gave their bodies to the commonwealth and received, each for his own memory, praise that will never die, and with it the grandest of all sepulchers, not that in which their mortal bones are laid, but a home in the minds of men, where their glory remains fresh to stir to speech or action as the occasion comes by. For the whole earth is the sepulcher of famous men; and their story is not graven only on stone over their native earth, but lives on far away, without visible symbol, woven into the stuff of other men's lives. For you now it remains to rival what they have done and, knowing the secret of freedom a brave heart, not idly to stand aside from the enemy's onset. 
We have a lot to learn from the selfless bravery and public service displayed by these two men. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends at this difficult time. God bless.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would first like to thank my distinguished colleagues, the Chairman Senator Gregg and Ranking Member Senator Hollings, for their leadership and superb management of this bill. I would like to take a moment to express my support for a matter of great importance to me, specifically obtaining funding for a Waterline Extension Project in Georgia. The project would involve providing $1,000,000 in Economic Development Administration (EDA) Public Works (Title I) funds for construction of an extended 16-inch water line (16,000 L.F.) along Macon Road (U.S. Highway 80) from Muscogee County into Talbot County. I understand that a proposal for this project was submitted to the EDA, but the application was denied. Apparently, the application was rejected because the project did not identify any, or a significant number of, near term new jobs. However, I have been assured that, although one industry alone would not fulfill the new job requirement, the waterline would allow several new industries to locate in the area which will more than meet the new job requirement. In fact, there have been commitments in writing from three businesses of their intent to locate in the newly developed industrial site. Talbot County is one of the most economically depressed counties in Georgia. In fact, in 1994, Talbot County had approximately 25% of its population living below the poverty line, ranking near the bottom of the state. If funded, the waterline would provide the vital infrastructure needed to serve potential industrial sites located in Talbot County and bring with it much needed opportunities for employment in well paying jobs. Senator Hollings, I understand that Committee policy prohibits earmarking EDA funding for individual projects. Is that accurate?

Further, assuming that the job-creating potential of the waterline Extension Project can be verified, I ask the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member if they would agree that this is the kind of project Congress intended for EDA to give favorable consideration to in its public works construction program?

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for their outstanding leadership on this important piece of legislation. Given the hard work that went into this bill, I wanted to first express my appreciation for what they have done. I am reminded of the old phrase `too many cooks spoil the broth.' Sometimes the legislative branch might be thought of in that way. As I offer this amendment, I have attempted to be mindful not to `spoil the broth.' 
As the former head of the Veterans Administration, the veterans portion of this bill continues to be near and dear to my heart. I am extremely pleased to see that the Appropriations Committee under the leadership of Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski has increased funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs by over $1.5 billion when compared to last year's budget. This represents a real increase in funding even when inflation is factored in. Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski are true friends of America's veterans, and we thank them. 
The amendment I have offered attempts to fill a void that exists with respect to services for veterans. When I was head of the Veterans Administration, it was clear to me that the VA could not be everywhere at all times. We relied heavily on other government agencies and private entities in our attempt to assure that all veterans could obtain the benefits they were entitled to and the assistance they needed. Today, in an era of balanced budgets, we cannot depend solely on federal dollars to solve every problem. The era of balanced budgets brings with it the era of partnership. 
The VA must continue to partner with other entities to fulfill its mission. For instance, in this year's Defense Authorization bill, I have authored language which would strongly encourage the VA to partner with the Department of Defense to provide health care for our nation's military personnel, their dependents, military retirees, and veterans. 
Today, I am advocating much stronger partnering between the VA and the private sector to fill the basic needs of our nation's veterans. The Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program was established in 1992 to fund the development and operation of transitional housing for homeless veterans who are free of alcohol and drugs. Over 2,000 beds have been made available under this program. Over $21 million has been appropriated for this purpose. 
Unfortunately, the current program is completely inadequate in the face of the overwhelming need which exists for housing for homeless veterans. The VA estimates that over 275,000 veterans are currently homeless on any given night. In a given year, over 500,000 veterans find themselves homeless at some point. In Atlanta, Georgia, nearly 10,000 veterans are in need of homeless assistance. This is clearly unacceptable. A mere 2,000 beds, while important, would not meet the needs of one state, let alone the entire nation. The program does not come close to fulfilling the entire need. Currently at approximately $7 million, it represents less than two-hundredths of a percent of the entire VA budget. 
The amendment I have offered would set aside $20 million for the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem program. This would nearly triple the amount available for this program. It would also insure that funds are available for rehabilitation, vocational training, and outreach. These are critical elements because the list of successful programs have demonstrated that helping veterans become drug and alcohol free and employable is the best way to insure that they not find themselves homeless again. Furthermore, it is important to provide for successful outreach to veterans in need to insure that veterans are able to take advantage of the services, both public and private, that are available to them. 
Several groups have contacted me since I was elected to the Senate to seek support for the veterans assistance projects they are trying to establish or expand. I would like to take a few moments to describe two such programs. 
Last year, the Georgia Military College conducted a pilot program in which veterans voluntarily undergoing drug rehabilitation were offered a college course. The program was paid for through the proceeds of a golf tournament sponsored by the Atlanta Veterans Administration Medical Center. Eighteen veterans participated in the original program. In light of the initial success, the Georgia Military College seized on the idea of expanding the program not only to provide for education but to offer additional counseling and to provide shelter for the participants. The College is in the process of establishing a 5-year program aimed at improving the lives of Georgia's homeless veterans. This is the type of program that can truly make a difference. Instead of a `band-aid' approach, it offers true skills training, and the transitional housing these veterans need to be able to continue with the program. 
The National Veterans Foundation offers perhaps one of the most important services a nation can provide to our veterans in need--a human voice. The Foundation was founded by Floyd `Shad' Meshad in 1985 to help veterans recover from the pain of war. It has aided over a quarter of a million veterans, funding housing, legal services, job training, counseling, and rehabilitative programs. A major focus of the Foundation is its toll-free Information and Referral Line. Shad Meshad refers to it as a `Clearing House' to direct veterans and their families to the assistance they need. It is a real human voice on the other end of the line, not a recording. Over the years, the National Veterans Foundation has logged thousands of calls. Unfortunately, this critical outreach program is only available during business hours, Monday through Friday. Our veterans deserve the kind of service provided by the National Veterans Foundation--but they deserve it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
These are just two of the types of programs that deserve the support of the VA. In my view, it is only lack of resources which currently limits that support. It should be made clear that what we are talking about is not the old give-away of federal funds. This is not new `corporate welfare.' I was introduced to the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem program fairly recently. I was surprised to learn that the Veterans Administration does not currently have a comprehensive grant program that could fund meritorious projects, but it does have this program. I believe the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program combined with a future comprehensive grant program will leverage federal dollars with private, state, and local money to create a multiplier effect that will aid our nation's veterans for years to come. It is my intent to introduce legislation in the future to provide the necessary statutory authority to establish a comprehensive grant program that goes beyond the current homeless assistance program. 
Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski for their cooperation and support for this amendment. Without their leadership, this amendment would not be possible. I look forward to working closely with them in the future to further assist our nation's veterans. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Ed Williams of Valdosta, Georgia, a man who has dedicated more than three decades of his life to bringing a Veterans Clinic to the Valdosta area. His dreams and hard work were realized with the April 28, 1998 opening and dedication of the new Valdosta Veterans Health Care Clinic. 
Ed is one of the few survivors of the original group of veterans who began working to bring a veterans clinic to Valdosta 35 years ago. I commend and graciously thank Ed Williams for all of his determination and hard work over the years in bringing this clinic to Valdosta. 
The Valdosta Veterans Health Care Clinic, located at 2123 N. Ashley St. in Valdosta, will serve the 7,000 veterans in Lowndes County and almost 5,000 veterans in the surrounding counties. The veterans of Georgia owe Mr. Williams the deepest gratitude and appreciation for his tireless efforts to secure the new facility. 
Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge and honor Ed Williams for his outstanding and innumerable contributions over the years to the Valdosta area, to the State of Georgia and to our Nation. He has dedicated his life to inspiring and improving us all, and I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting and congratulating Ed Williams on the opening of the Valdosta Veterans Health Care Clinic. It is great to see all of Ed's hard work pay off!

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss a very important issue, specifically my efforts to provide critical research funding for Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus. First, I would like to thank my distinguished colleagues, the Chairman, Senator Cochran, and Ranking Member Senator Bumpers, for their skillful work and superb leadership on this bill. I, like many of my colleagues, find it extremely fortunate to have two gentlemen in these posts who not only provide a valuable resource on matters facing agriculture, but can be depended on to work with Senators with candor and cooperation. As you may know, spotted wilt, caused by the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), has become a serious impediment to effective production of several economically important crops in the Southeast, causing an estimated $100 million in losses to peanuts and vegetable crops annually. The disease is endemic to the Southeast and the wide host range of the virus makes it extremely difficult to control. If you recall, in the letter which I sent to you earlier this year, I requested that $330,000 be appropriated to the College of Agriculture at the University of Georgia for a project titled the Integrated Approach to Mitigate Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus Epidemics in the Southeastern United States. Although funding has not been provided in this bill, I understand that the House version contains $200,000 for this project's research.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, as we approached the final Senate vote on H.R. 2676, the IRS Reform and Restructuring bill, I was reminded of Dickens' `A Tale of Two Cities'. As a conferee on this badly needed piece of legislation, I am led to observe that it is the best of bills, it is the worst of bills. 
In its germane provisions reforming the operations of the Internal Revenue Service it represents the best of Congress in identifying and enacting legislation to address the real needs of American citizens. But in its last minute, secretive addition of several extraneous matters, most notably the ISTEA technical corrections, it represents the Congress at its worst in circumventing public debate and scrutiny. 
In its putting the emphasis on the `Service' part of the IRS it demonstrates the best of policy-making in pursuit of the public interest which should be the focus of our efforts as national legislators. But, it also demonstrates the worst of our process in that in our haste to get something done rapidly, before the July 4 break, we are willing to cut some corners on important matters of national security. 
Mr. President, I support, 100 percent, the public's right to know when a federal agency abuses a taxpayer, and I support the public's demand for a remedy to that intolerable situation. I was extremely proud to have been chosen to serve as a member of the conference committee on the IRS bill. Chairman Roth, Vice Chairman Archer, Senator Moynihan, Congressman Rangel, and the remaining conferees from the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee did yeoman's work in crafting one of the most significant acts of the 105th Congress--the IRS Reform and Restructuring bill. 
This is groundbreaking legislation which recreates the IRS and puts in place dramatic changes which will make the agency more accountable to the American taxpayer. This bill revives the original purpose of the Internal Revenue Service: to collect tax revenue while providing the assistance and service taxpayers deserve. 
Most importantly, taxpayers will receive overdue rights under the IRS Reform and Restructuring Act. Under the new law, the burden of proof will lie with the IRS, and taxpayers' rights in recovering civil damages as a result of unacceptable collection practices by the IRS will be expanded. An `innocent spouse' provision is also contained in this legislation. This provides that all understated tax is transferred to the culpable spouse. Also, for couples who are divorced or have been legally separated for more than 12 months, taxpayers are only liable for the deficiency that is attributable to their income reporting. This is an important provision for those who have burdened with a tax bill for which they are not responsible. 
This conference report also reorganizes the tax collecting agency around the idea of taxpayer service. Knowledgeable employees who are specialized in meeting the needs of specific taxpayer categories--like individuals, small businesses, and corporations--will be available to answer taxpayers' questions. And, the IRS Commissioner will have some hiring flexibility to offer special packages to qualified, successful private sector employees who will increase the professionalism and responsiveness of the agency. 
Because of these and other needed improvements, I endorse the IRS Reform and Restructuring Act, and despite some misgivings I am about to enunciate, I will vote for the adoption of the conference report. However, I did not sign the report because, at the last minute, extraneous material was tacked on to this landmark legislation. Out of the blue, and without being considered in either the House or Senate bill, the ISTEA technical corrections bill was included as part of the IRS conference report. Through this maneuver, Senator Rockefeller was prevented from offering his amendment on the floor of the Senate to correct an injustice done to disabled veterans with smoking-related disabilities in the original ISTEA reauthorization bill. Through this maneuver, the Senate and the American people were denied the opportunity for open debate and an up-or-down vote on an issue affecting America's veterans who put their life on the line for this nation. 
Justice Louis Brandeis once said, `Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.' I could not vote to report out of committee the conference report because it runs counter to the open door, public process by which Congress should responsibly pass our laws. Sadly, all too often conference committees are the vehicle by which lawmakers fast-track controversial measures behind closed doors in order to avoid unpopular votes. There are no fingerprints. Issues which were not in the House-passed bill, not in the Senate-passed bill, too often mysteriously appear in the final conference report. Where is our accountability as the legislators of this country? 
However, though I will vote for this conference report because on balance it is good legislation which American taxpayers need and deserve, I want to make it crystal clear that this issue of appropriate compensation to veterans with smoking-related disabilities will NOT go away. When we come back into session after the July 4 break, I will work with Sen. Rockefeller, and others, to correct the injustice done to our veterans in the ISTEA reauthorization bill. Specifically, I believe we need to strike the veterans' disability compensation offset which was included in the President's budget and in the ISTEA bill as more of budget-saving device rather than as a clearly considered matter of veterans' benefit policy. 
On another front, I am also troubled by two provisions in this conference report which I believe, unintentionally, compromise the security of our nation. The first provision removes the lawful ability of the President, and most Cabinet members, to start or stop an audit or investigation of a taxpayer. Make no mistake: we all condemn the misuse of power to halt legitimate investigations or audits. But the lack of an exemption in the case of national security and law enforcement jeopardizes critical efforts to protect American citizens. It is my understanding that the Department of Justice has stated that the provision is unconstitutional. 
I have similar concerns about the second provision, which carves out an exception to the Inspector General statute, so that the Secretary of the Treasury is prohibited from exercising his authority to stop an investigation by the Tax IG when national security or law enforcement issues are at stake. The Treasury Department and the Central Intelligence Agency are both opposed to this provision. 
I worked with the other conferees to try to work out these national security problems but ultimately those efforts fell short because of time constraints. 
On balance, though, I support, enthusiastically, H.R. 2676, the IRS Reform and Restructuring Act. It will significantly improve the position of American taxpayers in their dealings with the IRS. But I abhor the closed door process by which the ISTEA technical corrections bill was attached. However, this and the national security flaws are correctable, if not now on this legislation, then certainly before the Senate adjourns for the year. I pledge my efforts to achieve that goal.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Herbert Green from Norcross, Georgia for his service in the United Auto Workers Union, and on 50 years of love and devotion to his lovely wife Autince as they celebrate their Golden Wedding Anniversary on Sunday, July 19, 1998. 
Walter Ruether, the great UAW leader, once said, `the most important thing in the world is to fight for the other guy.' 
This quote reminds me a lot of Herb Green because, for the last several decades, he has been organizing, educating and tirelessly fighting for the rights of working men and women in Georgia and our Nation. 
Many of us know how important the labor movement has been for the improvement of working conditions and fair compensation for millions of Americans. None of this would have happened if it had not been for tireless, visionary individuals who were willing to work on behalf of their coworkers, such as Herb Green. Prior to his retirement in 1987 as the International Representative for Region 8, he focused his efforts in the educational and political arenas of the UAW and the State of Georgia. His UAW involvement continues as a member of the UAW's Advisory Council. 
Herb's union work began in 1938 when he became a member of the Boot & Shoe Workers Union, followed by membership in the Packing House Workers Union from 1940 to 1942. After being hired at Local 10 (then GM BOP, now GM CPC) in Doraville in January 1949, Herb established his first UAW membership. He quickly became an active participant in Local 10's affairs, where he served as an Alternate Committeeman, Trustee, member of the Building Committee, District Committeeman, and for a number of years, Chairman of the Shop Committee. 
In January 1962 he was appointed as a member of the Region's CAP Education Staff by then Director, E. T. Michael, a job he held through most of his union career, representing Georgia, Florida and South Carolina. He also served as a UAW International Representative of Region 8, consisting of the states of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, four counties in south central Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, and Berkeley County, West Virginia. 
I have had the pleasure of knowing and working with Herb for many years. On issues like employee rights and education for our children, nobody has worked longer, fought harder or been more committed than him. I am proud to call Herb a close friend and someone who I look to for advice and guidance. 
A long time activist in the political and civic life of Georgia, Herb has served as a member of the Board of Review of the Georgia Employment Security Agency, the Urban League, Board Member of the United Way, Vice Chairman of the Gwinnett County Democratic Party, Member of the Board of Elections of the Gwinnett County Democratic Party, Member of Georgia State University's Advisory Committee of Labor Studies, and Chairman of the Trustees of Winter's Chapel Methodist Church, where he and his family have been members for many years. 
Herb, who just celebrated his 77th birthday, was born on July 6, 1921. He and his wife have two children, a daughter Kathy and a son Terry, and five grandchildren--the true inspirations of their lives. 
I am pleased to call attention to Herb's nearly half a century of dedicated service to the UAW and to congratulate him and Autince on 50 years of marital bliss. I know that they have many more years of happiness ahead of them. I wish them both the best and look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to salute Washington, DC's beloved Sholl's Colonial Cafeteria for 70 years of prospering business and never-ending dedication to its customers and employees. People have come from all around the world simply for a sampling of Sholl's down home hospitality and great food. 
I cannot count the number of meals I have eaten at this Washington institution, but as I am sure many of you who have also visited this landmark know, the memories of dining at Sholl's are endless. Each person who has dined at Sholl's has their own memory of what has made it so special to them. For some it was simply a piece of their apple or rhubarb pie. For others it was the unique experience of dining amongst close friends, colleagues or even new friends you made during a visit. 
But for everyone who has frequented Sholl's, there are fond memories of the wonderful people who worked at this restaurant and made it such an enjoyable place to start or end your day. The friendly hello from the late Evan Sholl, Cafeteria founder, and his beloved wife, Gertrude, or their son-in-law and current proprietor, George Fleishell has kept us all returning to Sholl's over the years. 
Patrons of Sholl's have described members of the Sholl family, who have owned and operated Sholl's over the last 70 years, as having the biggest hearts in Washington. 
Sholl's is not just a business. It is more like a home where friends meet regularly to get together and enjoy some good food and have a good time. Whenever I dine at Sholl's, it is like going to dinner at a friend's house. 
I have enjoyed eating at Sholl's Colonial Cafeteria for many years--since the days when I was an intern in 1963 until today. I hope that we will all be able to enjoy many more home cooked meals at Sholl's Cafeteria for many more years to come.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I want to recognize Major General Robert A. McIntosh for his distinguished service to our Nation. General McIntosh epitomizes our Air Force Reserve citizen-airman. He has demonstrated exceptional leadership as chief of Air Force Reserve, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C., and commander, Air Force Reserve, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia for the past three and a half years. 
General McIntosh served as the principal advisor to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and to the Secretary of the Air Force on all Air Force Reserve matters. As commander of the Air Force Reserve Command, he had overall responsibility for the command, control, and supervision of all U.S. Air Force Reserve units around the world. 
General McIntosh performed outstanding service and exhibited exceptional commitment to the Air Force Reserve. His in-depth knowledge of Air Force and Reserve Component issues was a tremendous asset to the Congress as we deliberated the major national defense issues impacting both our Active and Reserve Forces. His insight into Reserve issues was also instrumental in his well-deserved selection to this new position as the Assistant on Reserve Matters to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Commissioned through the Reserve Officer Training Corps Program at Ohio University in 1966, General McIntosh's early training prepared him well for his later assignments commanding Reserve fighter units in Louisiana, Missouri and Texas. Ultimately, he rose to command the more than 70,000 member Air Force Reserve. 
He is a highly-decorated Vietnam veteran for his extraordinary aerial achievement and devotion to duty while assigned as an A-37 pilot with the 604th Special Operations Squadron at Bien Hoa Air Base in South Vietnam. 
General McIntosh separated from active duty in August 1971 to join the air reserve technician program as a full-time civil service employee with active participation as an Air Force reservist. He is a command pilot with more than 4,000 flying hours in the A-10, A-37, C-130 and F-4. His military awards include the Distinguished Service Medal; Legion of Merit; Distinguished Flying Cross; Meritorious Service Medal with oak leaf cluster; Air Medal with 18 oak leaf clusters; Air Force Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster; and Vietnam Service Medal with three service stars. 
Throughout his distinguished career, he has commanded an Air Force Reserve wing, two Reserve numbered Air Forces, served as the vice commander of the Air Force Reserve, and his most recent position as the chief of the Air Force Reserve and commander of the Air Force Reserve Command--a dual hatted position. 
General McIntosh's outstanding leadership, sense of purpose and singular dedication to duty was crucial in the continuing successful integration of the Air Force Reserve into the total Air Force, culminating in the Congressionally-directed activation of Air Force Reserve Command as the service's ninth major command. 
Through initiatives he has sponsored, the Air Force Reserve has successfully entered new mission areas during his service as the chief of the Air Force Reserve, including the Reserve instructor pilot program; Space Command Group; Fighter Reserve Associate Test; Airborne Warning and Control System; and Combat Camera. 
In today's environment of shrinking budgets, downsizing and the increased role the Reserve Component plays in the national defense of our country, General McIntosh has provided us with a clear and concise view of the contributions and the versatility of our citizen-airmen. In that regard, he has provided us with a full spectrum of Air Force Reserve issues which helped in our decision making process. 
The United States is indebted to General McIntosh for his many contributions to this Nation. As his hallmark, he left a stronger Air Force Reserve. We thank Bob and his wife, Susie, for their selfless service to the men and women of the Air Force Reserve, and wish him the best in his new challenging position on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and their future endeavors.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for doing his homework. He is very courageous in touching on one of the serious issues regarding the F-22. 
All of the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, including myself, were rightly concerned about the issue of whether enough flight testing on the F-22 would be accomplished prior to making an informed decision on whether to proceed with low-rate initiation production. The dilemma we faced was simple: 
Do we move forward with the program at the risk that unknown problems would arise causing significant cost overruns and delays or do we shut down the production line in response to our concerns about testing which would certainly lead to cost overruns and a delay in the program? 
The Catch-22 we found ourselves in was not an easy one to solve. The Armed Services Committee took this head on, and I believe we arrived at an approach that addresses the testing issue, while also addressing the issue of keeping the program on track. Let me briefly explain what the Armed Services Committee did: 
First, we fenced Lot II funding, and made it absolutely contingent 
upon completion of 183 test hours. Let me repeat: It is absolutely contingent upon completion of 183 hours. If that level of testing cannot be done in FY-99, Lot II funding will not be released. Second, the committee placed an additional restriction on release of funding for Lot II. The Air Force must complete 433 flight-test hours or the Secretary of Defense must certify that less than 433 hours is acceptable, explaining why less than 433 is acceptable, showing how less than 433 hours is consistent with prior Defense Acquisition board recommendations, and showing why it is more cost-advantageous to proceed with Lot II than to delay the production line. 
These requirements are real. They are tough. they are realistic. 
Let me offer some perspective on the first requirement. Prior to an initial production decision for 2 aircraft, the F-22 will have 183 flight test hours. In comparison, the F-16 had only 21 flight test hours prior to initial production decision for 16 aircraft--162 less than the F-22. The F-18 A/B had no flight test hours prior to an initial production decision for nine aircraft. 
The second threshold, the completion of 433 hours or a certification for less than that provides us with this. The F-22 program has changed in many ways. And so many things have changed the way aircraft are designed and built today. With the advances in technology and concerns for keeping control of costs, in the future more and more testing will be done without actual flight test hours. 
It is undisputed that flight test requirements cannot be replaced entirely, but there are certain amounts of simulations and ground testing that can take the place of actual in-flight tests. 
Here is what the F-22 has gone through, to date: 153 prototype flight test hours--on high angle-of-attack, supercruise, and thrust vectoring technology; over 365,000 equivalent flight test hours on aircraft components and subcomponents; over 23,000 hours of software/hardware integration testing; over 6,000 hours of engine testing; 600 hours of high-fidelity radar cross section model testing; 450,000 hours of avionic ground tests; 123,000 hours of component structural tests; 2,000 hours of engine ground tests; 43,000 hours of wind tunnel testing. More importantly, there has been 25,000 hours of scaled wind tunnel testing without experiencing the `wing drop' phenomenon discovered in the F-18E/F wind tunnel testing. 
The Senate Armed Services Committee provisions would require the Secretary of Defense to certify all of this and make the case that less than 433 flight test hours on this gives us the level of confidence to proceed. 
I would like to say, Mr. President, that I speak in opposition to the Bumpers amendment. The Air Force informs us that a delay in the F-22 program associated with not being able to meet overly stringent requirements could increase the program some $4 billion. 
So, Mr. President, I speak in opposition to the amendment and yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. CLELAND. I rise today to discuss my grave concerns about the policy implications if a decision to produce tritium in a commercial nuclear reactor were to be made. My concerns are especially serious in light of the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan last month. The recent detonation of nuclear devices in South Asia should serve as a wake-up call to the U.S. and the international community about the unfinished business with respect to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
Most of the international effort to slow the spread of nuclear weapons has been focused on limiting access to plutonium and uranium. However, less attention has been given to tritium which can increase the capabilities of these nuclear weapons. To those unfamiliar with the use of tritium in nuclear munitions, tritium is to a nuclear weapon what Tabasco Sauce is to a good bowl of chili--it adds kick. The key point is that it is the tritium which allows the use of smaller delivery systems because it allows a smaller weapon to produce a much greater yield. In the age of concerns about suitcase bombs and the smuggling of weapons across borders, it is critical that we also attempt to limit access to tritium. 
It has been long-standing American policy to discourage the use of commercial reactors to produce weapons material. Instead, the Atomic energy Act mandated that the Atomic Energy Commission would be the exclusive owner of production facilities related to nuclear weapons. That authority now lies within the Department of Energy. Unfortunately, when drafted, the Atomic Energy Act did not specifically list tritium as a special nuclear material covered under the act. The House has passed legislation that would insure that tritium is covered as a special nuclear material which is only to be produced in a facility owned by the Department of Energy. I believe such an approach is a reasonable one given our non-proliferation objectives. 
Our dwindling supply of tritium and our need to preserve the nation's nuclear deterrent require the U.S. to develop a new tritium production capability at this time. To that end, the U.S. is currently considering two types of tritium production methods. Unfortunately, one of the two technology options under consideration contrasts sharply with our traditional policy. The use of commercial nuclear reactors raises serious concerns about non-proliferation. The U.S. has worked too long and too hard to stem the spread of weapons of mass destruction to abandon the principles of the Atomic Energy Act which has served as well over the last four decades. How can we urge the governments of India, Pakistan, North Korea, and any other country seeking a nuclear weapons capability not to attempt to use reactors designed for peaceful energy production for military purposes when we are contemplating doing a very similar thing here in America? 
Now, I am certainly no expert in nuclear physics and the production of nuclear weapons material. However, America has tremendous human resources within the Department of Energy in the form of our scientists, engineers, and plant workers. These Americans helped win the Cold War. Their contributions are significant and not to be overlooked. What is key is that their 
contributions are not yet done. The Department of Energy's Savannah River Site has been where tritium has been traditionally produced and processed. That is where America's expertise in tritium production lies. That is where we can be assured that our national non-proliferation objectives will never be subordinated to commercial or other concerns. It is my view that we should once again turn to those great workers there to get the job done as they have proven they are capable. 
I will certainly admit, proudly, to my constituency interest in seeing that the Savannah River Site be given fair consideration. However, there is a larger issue at stake here than the economic interests of competing constituent interests. Prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons and the preservation of American leadership on this issue is in the interests of every state, of every region, and of every American. 
I do not have the expertise to determine which technology is most viable and cost effective if the choice is between a reactor-based option and an accelerator option. However, I do know that at this point in history, it would be wrong to turn our backs on one of our most effective non-proliferation policies. It is my view that we should continue to maintain our nuclear weapons capability within DOE facilities where we have traditionally done this work. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Madam President, the debate on Bosnia has raised some fundamental questions regarding the conduct of our foreign policy particularly with respect to the deployment of U.S. military forces around the world. I will point out just a few of the questions that members have raised: 
What is the mission of U.S. forces in Bosnia? 
When can we expect to bring them home? 
What should the role of the Congress be in the fulfillment of this mission? 
How can we manage the cost of the Bosnia commitment in terms of dollars and the overall strain to our forces? 
It is good that we debate these important issues here in the Senate today. But I feel it is important to say that I believe we should ask only one question:

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank the distinguished Senator from Maine. 
For those who are entering into this discussion, Mr. President, nowhere, as far as I can tell as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in recruit training, in any 
service, do male and female recruits live in the same room or in the same squad bay. These conditions do not exist now and they did not exist when the incidents in Aberdeen took place. 
Male and female recruits do live in the same buildings. In some cases male and female recruits live in separate wings or on separate floors, and in some cases they live on the same floors but are separated by fire-safe barrier walls. In every case, the male and female recruits have controlled entrances and exits to their sleeping areas and have segregated toilet and shower facilities. The services are in the process of alarming all doors, exits and walls. 
The bottom line, Mr. President, is that in every case, in every service, although they might not live in separate buildings, male and female recruits live in physically safe, physically secure, and physically segregated living conditions. 
But, Mr. President, in the wake of the terrible incidents of sexual misconduct and sexual harassment that took place in Advanced Training at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, the National Defense Authorization Act of the last year established a congressional Commission on Military Training and Gender-Related Issues to review the requirements regarding cross-gender relationships of members of the Armed Forces and to review the basic training programs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and to make improvements on the programs. 
The idea for the commission came from the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who noted at the time: 
* * * there must be ways to thoroughly examine, review, and evaluate the reasons for the recent spate of scandals regarding sexual relations in training commands. Such a study should be made by an independent blue-ribbon body with unquestioned credentials--with no social agenda, but geared solely to the effect of gender integration at all levels of the military. 
Earlier this year, the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee appointed five distinguished Americans to that commission. Their counterparts on the House National Security Committee also appointed five outstanding individuals. 
The commissioners include two retired Marine Corps lieutenant generals, a retired Army command sergeant major, a former Assistant Secretary of Defense, a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, three distinguished academics, a military historian/national security analyst, and an expert on legal issues concerning women in the military. 
I have personally met with these commissioners and am convinced they understand the magnitude of the awesome task we have laid before them, and that they are eminently qualified and motivated to do the job. 
Because of our commitment to doing the right thing--as opposed to doing something quickly--the Armed Services Committee in the Senate included in its markup a provision to provide for a moratorium on changes to policies or practices regarding segregation on the basis of gender. 
The second-degree amendment Senator Snowe and I have offered retains the moratorium on changes to policies or practices regarding segregation on the basis of gender. I believe this is a very reasonable approach. It does not seek to prejudge the outcome of the commission's work. 
Additionally, it permits the commission to retain its 
independence. I believe this is an unwise course of action if we preempt the work of the commission. I know how I would feel if I responded to the call to serve on such a commission and was willing to dedicate my time for, say, a year of my life to study these complicated issues, only to find the same people--in this case, the Congress--who asked me to take on the issue, told me before I ever really got started in my work how they felt already. 
I would wonder if they really wanted a thoughtful, professional analysis or if they only wanted the appearance of a study to support preconceived ideas and predetermined agendas. I do not believe this was the Senate's intention when it supported the bill authorizing the Defense Act last year. 
We have established a process to review gender-related matters in their entirety. It does not make sense, to me, for us to separate out one or two aspects of this incredibly complex issue and to provide some piecemeal solution with little or no thought of the consequences our actions could have on the rest of the military--recruiting as well as training and retention. 
I am aware that the recommendation for separate barracks for male and female recruits came from the Kassebaum committee appointed by the Secretary of Defense. I am also aware that the Secretary of Defense has decided not to implement that recommendation. And the uniformed leadership--the most senior officers and enlisted members of the Army, Navy, and Air Force--also oppose the recommendation. 
For example, Mr. President, our committee received a letter from General Reimer, Chief of Staff of the Army, who said:  
Segregating their units into gender unique platoons for training and billeting the solders by gender in separate buildings will degrade the commander's ability to command and control his or her unit. 
Admiral Johnson, Chief of Naval Operations: 
Sailors should learn to live and work together from the first day of training. 
Admiral Pilling, Vice Chief of Naval Operations: 
Learning about security, privacy, dignity and personal responsibility should not be a lesson left for the fleet to teach. 
General Ryan, Chief of Staff of the Air Force: 
The saying `train as we operate' is more than a catch phrase, it is an absolute necessity to ensure that team building begins on the first day our recruits report to basic training. 
Senior enlisted members also commented on this issue as well. 
Any attempt [they said] to make a training policy that applies across all Services is not in the best interest of the nation and will impact the readiness of the total force. 
Mr. President, in terms of the readiness of the force, I was recently in Bosnia a few weeks ago. And I did see on a fire base there women actively engaged in work on the fire base. But I noticed that their living quarters were separate, safe, and secure. It was an incredible demonstration to me that women and men can serve in this Nation's interests in foreign lands and do so extremely well. 
I would also like to note that the Kassebaum report itself has actually been criticized by the GAO because of flawed methodology. According to GAO, the value of the Kassebaum committee's methodology is limited for making conclusions and recommendations, and the extent to which the committee's work supports its conclusions and recommendations cannot be determined. 
When the Secretary of Defense, a former Member of this body, and the uniformed leadership of the military, officers and enlisted, oppose something, I certainly take time to listen. 
Today, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to listen to the leadership of the military and give the Senate a chance to listen to the commission which we actually created and appointed to help us make decisions to guide us in these complex matters. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I support the Snowe amendment and urge my colleagues to adopt it. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Ford's amendment to strike title XV of the Lugar-McConnell tobacco farming provision and to express my support for the Long-term Economic Assistance for Farmers Act, or LEAF Act. 
First, I would like to thank my distinguished colleagues, the chairman, Senator McCain, and ranking member, Senator Hollings, for their superb leadership of this bill, the principal aim of which is the vitally important objective of curbing youth smoking. Also, I would like to extend my sincerest appreciation to Senator Ford for his time and energy in crafting a bill that effectively looks out for the interests of the tobacco farmers and their communities' interests, which were all ignored until he spoke out so forcefully and effectively. Senator Ford's integrity and honesty and courage will be sorely missed when he leaves this Chamber, and I, like many of my Senate colleagues, will deeply miss the opportunity to seek his counsel on the important issues about which the Senator has tremendous knowledge and passion. Certainly there has been no finer, more consistent friend of family tobacco farmers than the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky. I ask my colleagues to remember this fact as we debate on this matter. 
In my personal review of the tobacco settlement legislation, I have had two main objectives--to prevent our children from smoking and to ensure that tobacco farmers and their communities are taken care of. 
Now, I am sure that all of my colleagues are committed to this first objective, but I want to make sure that the second objective of promoting and protecting tobacco farmers is actually provided for in this bill. I fully support the LEAF Act and, indeed, was an original cosponsor, and I want to state my reasons for favoring the LEAF approach over the proposal offered by the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar. 
First, I do not support Senator Lugar's proposal, because I think it provides for quick termination of the Federal tobacco program. I have a concern about who the actual beneficiaries of this action will be. Is it tobacco farmers, is it the taxpayer, or is it the tobacco industry? 
According to an Agriculture Department analysis, if the tobacco price support program ends, as it would under the Lugar plan, the price of flue-cured tobacco would drop from $1.72 per pound to $1.15 while burley tobacco would drop from $1.89 to $1.15. Accordingly, if these estimates prove to be accurate, this would save cigarette companies approximately $1 billion every year; that is, $1 billion annually, Mr. President. 
Considering the fact that the tobacco program is a no-net-cost program to taxpayers and tobacco farmers will be receiving a 35 percent reduction in farm income, I think it is pretty obvious who will be benefiting under Senator Lugar's proposal--the tobacco industry, period. Then where are we? What have we accomplished? What good will be our efforts to eliminate underage smoking by raising the price of cigarettes if the tobacco companies receive a $1 billion windfall every year at the expense of tobacco farmers? This is a crucial question that I believe must be answered before the Senate contemplates letting the Lugar proposal remain in the legislation. 
Second, while it provides more in buyout payments over a shorter timeframe, the Lugar proposal provides for substantially less in assistance for farm families and community assistance than the LEAF bill. Senator Lugar's proposal eliminates nearly $10 billion in funds for this type of transitional aid. It eliminates funding earmarked to provide higher education opportunities for tobacco farmers and their families, for transition payments to tobacco industry workers who lose jobs, as well as billions of dollars in funds to provide grants to communities for agricultural and economic development in tobacco-producing counties. 
I can understand the appeal that a quick buyout for tobacco quota might have for a tobacco farmer, but I am extremely concerned that the buyout proposal included in the Lugar bill is actually nonattainable. The funding level contemplated in Senator Lugar's bill is $18 billion over 3 years. At this level, it would require Congress to provide $6 billion a year for this one purpose, which is three times--three times--the amount available under this bill during this period. 
So what happens if this money is not fully delivered? I will tell you, Mr. President, what I think could happen. We will have left the tobacco farmer and their communities with an unfulfilled promise. In my home State of Georgia, farmers, including those who grow tobacco, have experienced extremely hard times over the last few years and are anxious to hear any good news. Then they hear about something called a buyout with large payments over 3 years, and understandably some get excited. But in order to deliver this amount of funds in this 
timeframe, we would have to cut the amount of funds available for public health programs and research by almost 75 percent. 
Now, I ask you, Mr. President, is this likely? Can we legitimately expect that we are going to eliminate 75 percent of the funding for counteradvertising, child care, NIH research, and cancer clinical trials? Can we honestly believe that these buyout funds will be available? In this Senator's opinion, the answer is clearly no. Let us not make false promises to tobacco farmers and their communities. Let us be honest. I implore my colleagues to carefully review the impact of each of these proposals as well as our ability to achieve them. 
I urge you to oppose the proposal offered by Senator Lugar and support the LEAF Act. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge a great American, a wonderful patriot and fellow Georgian, Major General James C. Pennington, United States Army, Retired, and President of the National Association for Uniformed Services. General Pennington died June 5th at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, where he had a speaking engagement addressing the veterans and military health care systems. 
General Pennington was born in Rocky Ford, Georgia, and spent most of his life soldiering--first in the military and then in a military association. Entering the armed forces during World War II, he worked his way up through the ranks from private to major general. During his distinguished 37-year military career, he always made taking care of the troops his top priority. He was very proud to defend this great Nation. 
General Pennington's fight for soldiers did not cease with his retirement from the military. In fact, it just allowed him to expand the effort on behalf of the National Association for Uniformed Services. He passionately and tirelessly pursued benefits for veterans and the health care promises made to military retirees. 
Shortly after I was elected to the United States Senate, General Pennington came to my office to enlist my support on this critical health care issue. This past year, I made military health care my number one legislative priority. In the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 1999, I cosponsored a military health care initiative which seeks to improve the quality and accessibility of health care for our veterans and military retirees. It is because of men like General Pennington that this issue has been brought to the forefront of our attention as legislators. All veterans owe a debt of gratitude to him. 
General Pennington's life is testimony to the fact that we still have American heroes. Let us remember him and continue his crusade in fulfilling our commitment to our soldiers.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, for his work on behalf of small businesses. We are both members of the Small Business Committee here in the Senate. 
Mr. President, I speak this morning to introduce legislation with my colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, and fellow cosponsors, including Senators Daschle, Lautenberg, Mikulski, Abraham, D'Amato, Breaux, Dodd, Bingaman, Kohl, Landrieu, Torricelli, Leahy, Grassley, Snowe, Harkin, Bumpers, and Feinstein. That is an impressive bipartisan list of Senators. 
This legislation, simply stated, recognizes the outstanding contributions that women's business centers have made to women entrepreneurs across the Nation. In light of this outstanding achievement in the President's budget request, I am proud to offer this measure expressing the findings of Congress that funding for these centers, these women's business centers, should be increased. I note that the centers are the only organization, nationally, that focus exclusively on entrepreneurial training for women. Increased funding would allow for new centers and subcenters to be established and for continued funding for existing centers, including the on-line women's business center. Increased funding would achieve the goal of expanding centers to all 50 States. Our legislation would increase funding for women's business centers under the SBA in steps, from the current level of $8 million to $9 million for fiscal year 1999, $10.5 million for fiscal year 2000, and $12 million for fiscal year 2001. 
Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to talk about four focal points of women's business centers. The first and 
most important focus is the customer. These centers have responded to women's needs by offering training, and during accessible hours at nights and on weekends. In addition to regular training courses, special instructions on starting at-home child care businesses have also been offered. As the SBA Administrator Aida Alvarez points out, the number of clients served in the second year of the program increased by 40 percent. Approximately 44 percent of clients served were actually socially disadvantaged. More than 33 percent of the clients were economically disadvantaged, nearly 40 percent were minorities, and 18 percent were actually on public assistance at the time. 
Then there is the community focus. Women's business centers are a network of more than 60 community-based women's business centers operating in 36 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Each center offers long-term training, networking, and mentoring to potential and existing entrepreneurs, most of whom could not or would not start businesses without substantial help, and each center tailors its programs to the needs of the individual community it serves. 
Next is the economic focus. In terms of job growth, significantly high numbers of full- and part-time jobs were created at average hourly wages at least double the minimum wage. In the area of loan growth, the number of small loans received by clients has more than doubled since the first year of the program. In terms of small business growth, 78 percent of all center clients were startup businessowners or aspiring entrepreneurs. The centers taught them business basics and provided practical support and realistic encouragement. 
The last focus is that of technology. The on-line women's business center, at www.onlinewbc.org, is an interactive state-of-the-art web site that offers virtually everything an entrepreneur needs to start and build a successful business, including on-line training, mentoring, individual counseling, topic forums and news groups, market research, a comprehensive State-by-State resource and information guide, and information on all of the SBA's programs and services, plus links to countless other resources. This site was developed by the North Texas Women's Business Development Center in cooperation with more than 60 women's business centers and several corporate sponsors. This summer, information will be available in nine different languages. 
Mr. President, I want to conclude my statement by thanking the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry. I think this legislation offers small businesses and entrepreneurs in America hope, particularly women businessowners and potential women businessowners. It is the hope of a better life for oneself, one's family and community, which actually drives entrepreneurs and also drives the economic engine in this country, which is so vital to our well-being as a Nation. Women's business centers are a distributor of that hope. We in Congress need to recognize that this program works. It makes a positive difference in the lives of so many women and the countless citizens they employ. 
I hope all of my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring our bipartisan legislation. I look forward to its future and timely consideration in the Senate Committee on Small Business. I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to be here this morning to present this legislation, which I think will serve the needs of so many.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of one of our Nation's most compassionate and visionary leaders, Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated 30 years ago. He served our nation as Attorney General and United States Senator, but his impact on our nation's history cannot be measured by mere titles or the offices he held. 
Although his life was cut short thirty years ago, his legacy will live on forever. Many of today's leaders were inspired by Bobby Kennedy--he inspired me to become involved in politics more than three decades ago. I had the privilege to meet Bobby Kennedy in the summer of 1965 at Stetson University. Shaking his hand forever changed my life. Now today in the Senate my desk is very close to his old desk on the Senate floor--close enough to always remind me of why I first got involved in politics. 
Bobby Kennedy's philosophy was truly admirable. Bobby Kennedy was committed to equal opportunity for all. He displayed ceaseless devotion to the impoverished members of the American community, and pushed for decent wages and adequate healthcare for all. He knew the importance of protecting the well-being of our youth, and he fought to improve their education. Throughout his life, he worked toward a more just society. 
His tragic death shocked and saddened the hearts of America. I was recovering from my injuries from Vietnam in Walter Reed Hospital the day I heard of his tragic death. I am sure many others have a similarly clear recollection of that day. We had lost a committed, warmhearted leader who we would never forget or replace. 
Mr. President, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in remembering this admirable and courageous leader, who forever changed the history of this nation. Thirty years later, his memory and legacy live on. We continue to remember Robert F. Kennedy for his passion, courage and devotion, and will always do so.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire has spoken eloquently about young people and the lives of young people and how we ought to be concerned on their behalf. I would like to spend a moment of the Senate's time speaking about a young boy in my State, James Adams, of Fairburn, GA, who is now 5 years old. Because of the rules of his parents' HMO, what happened to him in March of 1993, when he was only 6 months old, has changed his life forever. 
The Senator from New Hampshire was speaking of right and wrong about young people. What happened to James Adams of Fairburn, GA, was not right. 
James was suffering from a fever of over 100 degrees. Like 160 million other Americans, his parents were enrolled in a managed health care plan. James' mother took him to his HMO plan pediatrician, who diagnosed only a respiratory ailment and post-nasal drip. He prescribed only saline drops, vaporizer use, and Tylenol every four hours. James' mother was told not to worry, that high fevers in young children do not necessarily mean serious illness. 
Later that night, his temperature was still rising and he was in great discomfort. James' worried mother called her HMO directly. The nurse on duty recommended bathing James in cold water. A pediatrician then placed a follow-up call, advising the parents to bring James to an HMO-participating hospital--42 miles away. 
On the way to the hospital, as his parents' car sped past multiple other hospitals in Atlanta not covered by the Adams' HMO, James suffered full cardiac and respiratory arrest, and lost consciousness. His parents decided they simply couldn't wait to get him to the HMO hospital--James needed care immediately. His parents pulled into the closest hospital they could find--still 6 miles from their target destination. Upon his arrival at that hospital, doctors were able to restore his pulse and breathing. But the circulation to his hands and feet was cut off, and never returned. 
James suffered irreparable damage to his extremities. Both his hands and feet had to be amputated. The delay of care caused by driving almost an hour to an affiliated hospital had taken its toll. 
Today, James is doing really well. He was able to get to a hospital just in time enough to save his life, and has worked hard ever since to rehabilitate himself. I am confident he will be able to lead a full and productive life. But could things have turned out better for James? Probably so. 
The question I have is, if S. 1890, the Patients Bill of Rights had been in effect, could it have helped James Adams and his family? The answer: probably so. 
First, the Patients Bill of Rights would have covered access to and payment for emergency services. That is, regardless of what the outcome looked like at the time, since James' parents reasonably believed that emergency care was needed, they would have been able to get it, accessibly, in time. I believe that an individual should be assured that if they have an emergency, those services will be covered by their plan. This bill states that individuals 
must have access to emergency care, without prior authorization, in any situation that a `prudent lay person' would regard as an emergency. 
Second, the Adams family's HMO could not have restricted their choice in service provider. They would have been able to have their own doctor--a regular doctor--convenient to where they live, and covered by their HMO plan. 
Third, the Adams' HMO would have been more clearly liable. Luckily, the lawsuit against the HMO that James' family went through was successful, but under current law such an outcome is far from guaranteed. The Patients Bill of Rights includes a provision for health plans that make medical decisions which result in harm to the patient, just as doctors and hospitals are held accountable today. 
In addition, the Patients Bill of Rights would mandate a fair and timely appeal process both within the plan and to an independent external body when health plans deny care. It would also provide for access to medical specialists, continued care when a plan or provider is terminated and protection for providers who advocate on behalf of their patients. 
Most important, the Patients Bill of Rights would help restore some of the confidence consumers have lost in their health care plans. It would ensure that Americans receive the care they were promised when they enrolled in their plan, and that they paid for with their monthly premiums. 
I believe it is imperative that as lawmakers, we work with health professionals, insurance providers and the American people, to create the most efficient, accessible and responsive health care system possible. To that end I am cosponsoring S. 1890, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998, which would reform the delivery of managed care. We have a responsibility to ensure that the best health care system in the world remains accessible and affordable to all Americans. Though managed care has changed the nature of the health care industry by providing a more coordinated approach to medical care which reduces costs and waste, many beneficiaries believe, with cause, that their quality of care has been diminished. 
As the debate over health care reform continues, I will continue to fight to refocus our health care system on patients--like James Adams--and away from the bottom line. 
The ultimate goal of any health care provider, including managed care providers, should be to provide the best possible care for the patient. Anything less is unacceptable. Although the financial aspects are important, we cannot let patient care be sacrificed just because of a bottom line issue. I believe that Congress must take swift action to address the issue of managed care reform and I believe that the Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998 is a significant step in that direction. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Ossabaw Island Foundation and the Georgia Commissioner of Natural Resources for their efforts to preserve Ossabaw Island, Georgia's first Heritage Preserve. 
Georgia's high rate of population and economic growth have created statewide expansion into previously uninhabited areas. Efforts to preserve and protect endangered natural areas is vital to the well being of Georgia's environment. 
Ossabaw Island is one of the few remaining barrier islands on the Atlantic Coast. The fragile ecosystems of the island should be preserved so that natural areas along the coast will work to protect estuaries, wildlife, marshes, and coastal shorelines. If Ossabaw Island remains in its natural state, it will provide needed protection for the mainland from Atlantic storms, permit the functioning of marshes which provide water and air purification essential to habitation of Georgia's mainland, and provide conditions not tainted by human intervention for environmental research. 
I would like to commend the Ossabaw Island Foundation, a public/private partner with the State of Georgia's Department of Natural Resources, for diligently serving as a voice for the preservation of the island. The Foundation has worked to incorporate educational and cultural programs in the island's historical buildings and to provide appropriate access and utilization of the Ossabaw Heritage Preserve. 
Through the efforts of the Board of Trustees of the Foundation, Ossabaw Island was included on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Eleven Most Endangered Properties List of 1995. The island was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior in 1996. 
The importance of preserving natural habitats is a common belief among the members of the Senate. We must not allow the natural beauty and resourcefulness of our nation to be sacrificed for lesser purposes. The benefits of protecting and preserving areas of natural habitat range from aesthetic to practical and must not be ignored. 
Mr. President, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in recognizing the partnership and hard work of the Georgia Commissioner of Natural Resources and the Board of Trustees of the Ossabaw Island Foundation. Their combined efforts have protected and will continue to protect and ensure a beautiful environment on Georgia's Ossabaw Island for many years to come.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize The University of Georgia School of Law's many years of accomplishments and achievements, and to honor former Governor of Georgia Carl Sanders, who graduated from UGA's Law School 50 years ago. 
I would like to applaud the commitment and hard work of the entire law school community: the faculty, staff, students, and alumni. The reputation of the school continues to grow and prosper each year. 
Over the years UGA has produced thousands of successful lawyers, including many leaders and policy makers. Since opening its doors in 1785, the law school has graduated five U.S. Senators, 30 Members of Congress, nine governors, including Gov. Carl Sanders, eight Speakers of the Georgia House of Representatives and 54 Appellate Judges. 
I recently had the opportunity to deliver the commencement speech to the 1998 graduating class of The University of Georgia School of Law and was reminded of the impact and value of the law. 
In order for the law to be respected, and for us to be respected as authorities on the law--whether as lawyers, law enforcement or lawmakers--there must be a sense of morality behind the law. It is a basic historical fact that people will not obey unjust law. 
As I look around Washington I see many reminders of the importance of the law. The inscription on the Supreme Court building is: `Equal justice under law.' There is an inscription over the 10th Street entrance of the U.S. Department of Justice Building in Washington which reads: `Justice in the life and conduct of the State is possible only as first it resides in the hearts and souls of its citizens.' Justice comes before the law. All of us who touch the law are bound by this justice and honor. 
With justice and morality behind the law, we strengthen it. Without it, the law is weakened. If all of us who touch the law do not abide by these terms, the law loses its credibility. Ultimately, those of us who touch the law have a responsibility to lead others to respect it. 
The men and women who have graduated from The University of Georgia with law degrees over the past two hundred years have and will continue to strengthen and uphold the law of this nation. I ask my colleagues in the Senate today to join me in saluting and congratulating The University of Georgia School of Law for instructing and graduating men and women who have shaped our nation's history during the last two centuries, including Gov. Carl Sanders and other Georgia lawmakers.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate former President Jimmy Carter on the naming of the Navy's third and final Seawolf-class submarine, the U.S.S. Jimmy Carter. 
After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946, President Carter fulfilled a dream from his childhood in southwest Georgia by serving in both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets. As a submariner, he was selected by the late Adm. Hyman Rickover to help in the development of the fledgling U.S. nuclear submarine program, a program which has realized its full potential in the Seawolf-class attack submarines. 
I had the privilege of attending the naming ceremony at the Pentagon on April 27 with President and Mrs. Rosalynn Carter. Navy Secretary John H. Dalton praised the U.S.S. Jimmy Carter as a bridge to the next generation of attack submarines. The newest Seawolf vessel, named after the only President to serve on a submarine, is currently being built and is due to join the U.S. fleet in December 2001. 
I ask my colleagues in the Senate today to join me in saluting and congratulating President Carter on his years of service in this Nation's Navy, and later as Governor of my home State of Georgia and President of the United States. President Carter is respected by all Americans for his efforts on behalf of our country both during and after he held office. The naming of the U.S.S. Jimmy Carter is a wonderful tribute to honor a great American in a manner befitting his outstanding service to this nation.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the following students from Dunwoody High School in Dunwoody, Georgia and their teacher for their excellent performance in the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution. I would like to congratulate the students who competed in this year's competition: Bakari Brock, Jennifer Campbell, Richard Cartwright, Michael Cayes, Carol Chandler, Melissa Chastney, Zack Cullens, Melissa Derrick, Kevin Franklin, Erin Green, Judy Hudgins, Rebecca Lamb, Dwayne O'Mard, Sandra Park, Andrea Pierce, Jennifer Price, Scot Prudhomme, Carlyn Sibler, Geren Stone, Dannon Taylor, David Weiner, David Yoo, and teacher Celeste Boemker. I would also like to recognize the efforts of the State Coordinator, Michele Collins and District Coordinator, John Carr, who helped these students make it to the finals. 
This bright group of young students competed against 49 other classes from around the nation, testing their knowledge of the United States Constitution and our government. Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the program is the most extensive of its kind, reaching more than 26 million students in elementary, middle and high schools. The students spent hours in role playing and testing to prepare themselves for this competition. The three-day program simulates a Congressional hearing in which students' presentations are judged on the basis of their knowledge of constitutional principles and their ability to apply them to historical and contemporary issues. 
Mr. President, it is with great pride that I offer my congratulations to these students from Dunwoody High School for their outstanding performance at the We the People competition, and wish them continuing success with their future studies.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my reservations about the merits of S. 1260. 
I served as Georgia's Secretary of State and Commissioner of Securities for many years. I was responsible for administering Georgia's securities laws and providing investor protection for Georgia residents. 
We are all aware that the securities markets are an integral part of our nation's economy and that we have experienced tremendous growth in these markets. Nearly half of all American households now invest in the stock market either directly or through mutual funds. These are not just rich people trying to become richer. These are primarily middle class Americans seeking to fund their children's education, to save up for a down payment on a home, and to provide a decent standard of living for themselves in retirement. In 1990, only 17.8 percent of all Americans invested in equities but that figure has grown dramatically, and one in three households now own securities. 
Unfortunately, these successes have led to a tremendous increase in fraud and abuse. Recently, top securities watchdogs in the United States have warned that the explosion in the stock market has led to a sharp rise in securities sales fraud and stock price manipulation. Several studies have shown that many Americans lack the financial sophistication to protect themselves from fraud. At a town meeting in Los Angeles, SEC Chairman Levitt cautioned that investors are `more vulnerable than ever to fraud.' This concern has been echoed by others who point to a disturbing rise in the level of securities fraud and there are many allegations that organized crime is seeking a foothold in certain sectors of the securities marketplace. 
It is unclear whether there is any means for defrauded investors to recover stolen money under federal law following the passage of the 1995 PSLRA, which severely limits the rights of defrauded investors. Preemption of state remedies under S. 1260 could lead investors with no ability to protect themselves against fraud. Several federal district courts have issued rulings on the 1995 law that are so restrictive that they threaten almost all private enforcement--including holding that reckless wrongdoers are no longer liable to their victims under the PSLRA. I strongly disagree with this interpretation because Congress, when it crafted the PSLRA, it did not intend to eliminate recklessness as a standard of liability. On the contrary, it is my understanding that the PSLRA did not, in any way, alter the scienter standard in federal securities fraud suits. 
Let us be clear about who suffers in the cases of securities fraud--it is retirees living on fixed incomes, young families struggling to make ends meet and save for their children's education, teachers, and factory workers. Each day, devastating cases are brought to the attention of securities regulators and law enforcement officers. Indeed, financial fraud is a serious and growing problem. No discussion about securities litigation reform is complete without serious consideration of the potential impact on small investors across the country. The elimination of state remedies against fraud could be catastrophic for millions of Americans. The fundamental purpose of securities law is to protect investors, something that S. 1260 does not adequately address. In fact, S. 1260 is designed merely to protect big business. 
The confidence in our securities markets results, in part, because of the cooperative enforcement system that has served the United States exceptionally well since the Depression. Substantive securities regulation in this country began at the state level. In 1911, the State of Kansas enacted the nation's first Blue Sky Law. Other states quickly adopted their own version of such legislation. Congress passed federal securities laws in 1933 and 1934 to complement--not replace--state laws and to stop abuses that caused the 1929 crash. 
Many states have chosen to provide more expansive investor protections than federal law currently provides--through accountability for aiders and abettors, realistic time limits for filing a fraud claim, and the ability of investors to recover fully from professionals who help perpetrate frauds when the primary wrongdoer is bankrupt, in jail, or has fled the country. 
In the late 1980s as Secretary of State, I conducted a series of public hearings to focus on securities fraud taking place in Georgia. This led me to recommend a number of changes to strengthen Georgia's securities laws. These changes established significant disclosure requirements for those dealers offering and selling certain stocks within or from the state of Georgia. These recommendations were unanimously enacted as amendments to the Georgia Securities Act, and gave my staff more tools to effectively deal with securities fraud. The Georgia legislature also installed securities fraud as a predicate offense for purposes of liability under the RICO statute. I am pleased to report that the efforts of the Georgia General Assembly are the rule rather than the exception. According to the SEC, 49 of the 50 states provide liability for aiders and abettors now unavailable under federal law, and 33 states provide longer statutes of limitations for securities fraud actions than current federal law. Mr. President, S. 1260 would undermine these important state remedies. 
Simply put, S. 1260 is an affront to the efforts of state 
governments across the country to locally protect their public investors from fraudulent securities transactions. For example, this bill reinforces the unduly short statute of limitations in federal law. In effect, federal law rewards those perpetrators of fraud who successfully conceal the fraud for more than three years. A majority of states have statutes of limitations that are longer than the federal statute. As currently written, S. 1260 would preempt those state laws. Furthermore, the definition of `class action' contained in this bill is overly broad. I have been informed that the definition of `class action' in S. 1260 would allow single suits filed in the same or different state courts to be rolled into a larger federal class action, and this was never contemplated or desired by individual plaintiffs. 
Another cause for concern is that under S. 1260, defrauded state and local pension funds are barred from recovering from corporate wrongdoers in state court. Since many remedies have already been foreclosed in federal court, the state or local government and its taxpayers may be required to make up losses in the pension fund resulting from fraudulent securities transactions. If state and local governments are creatures of state law, shouldn't they be entitled to pursue state remedies? 
State and local government representatives are unequivocal in their opposition to S. 1260. The National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the Government Finance Officers Association, and the National Association of State Retirement Administrators all reject the bill in its current form. 
Mr. President, I am not convinced that the federal preemption of state anti-fraud protections is a necessary step. Preemption supporters emphasize an `explosion' of state suits filed to circumvent the PSLRA in the two years since its enactment. Yet the number of state securities class actions filed in 1997--only 44 nationwide--represents a 33 percent decrease since 1996 and is lower than the number filed in any of the three years before the PSLRA was passed. In addition, most of the state court cases have been filed in California. No state other than California has had more than seven securities class actions filed in the two years since the enactment of the PSLRA. Mr. President, if a problem exists, then it should be addressed in Sacramento, not Washington, and I understand that California has already established a legislative commission to study its laws and make changes if necessary. Other states should be free to decide how to protect their own citizens from fraud. 
Mr. President, I support the right of investors to seek legal remedies against those persons selling fraudulent securities. I have supported an investor's right to seek redress through mediation, arbitration, and civil litigation. While I worked to streamline the regulatory process in Georgia, I opposed amendments to federal regulations that would have impaired the ability of a state to protect its investors. Here in the Senate, my focus remains the same. For this reason, I oppose S. 1260. 
Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.  
Mr. DAMATO addressed the Chair.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and the Gulfstream V industry team on winning the coveted Robert J. Collier Trophy for 1997. The Gulfstream V is the world's first ultra-long range large cabin business jet. Both the Gulfstream V and the Gulfstream IV SP are manufactured in Savannah, Georgia. 
The Collier trophy is aviation's most prestigious award. It is given annually by the National Aeronautics Association to recognize the top aeronautical achievement in the United States. Gulfstream and the G-V Industry team were presented the trophy at a ceremony on April 29 hosted by the National Aeronautical Association and the National Aviation Club in Arlington, Virginia. 
Gulfstream and the Gulfstream V industry team were recognized specifically `for successful application of advanced design and efficient manufacturing techniques, together with innovative international business partnerships, to place into service the Gulfstream V--the world's first ultra-long range business jet.' Past winners of this prestigious award include Orville Wright, Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 flight crew, Charles E. `Chuck' Yeager and my colleague from Ohio, Senator and astronaut John Glenn. 
Certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in April, 1997, the Gulfstream V business jet is the first aircraft of its kind in the world. With unmatched performance, comfort and speed, the Gulfstream V has a range that is 50% greater than any other business jet currently in service. The Gulfstream V can carry eight passengers and a crew of four for nonstop distances of up to 6,500 nautical miles at speeds of up to Mach .88. It is designed to cruise routinely at an altitude of 51,000 feet. Last year, in the first eleven months of service, the Gulfstream V set 47 world and national records, consisting of 22 city pair speed records and 25 performance records. 
The Gulfstream V has made nonstop travel between cities such as Tokyo and Washington, London and Beijing, and Los Angeles and Moscow routine business. 
The Gulfstream V was recognized as one of the `Ten Most Memorable Flights in 1997' by the National Aeronautic Association for a flight from Washington, DC to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The flight was 6,330 nautical miles and took 12 hours and 40 minutes. It flew nonstop. 
Mr. President, I want to salute and congratulate the 6,000 men and women of the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation on their outstanding work and this extraordinary achievement.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, one of my proudest honors as a United States Senator is to serve as the Ranking Member on the Personnel Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It is in this capacity that I feel I can contribute to supporting the men and women in our Armed Forces. 
Last week I introduced a military health care proposal which I referred to as KP Duty, as in `Keeping Promises Duty.' In the military, KP stands for `kitchen police' which is a term for messhall clean up which recruits are tasked to do when they go through basic training. This KP duty I am proposing is for all of us to clean up a commitment--the promises made to our servicemen and women. 
The Fiscal Year 1998 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 105-85) included a Sense of the Congress Resolution which provided a finding that `many retired military personnel believe that they were promised lifetime health care in exchange for 20 or more years of service.' Furthermore, it expressed the sense of Congress that `the United States has incurred a moral obligation' to provide health care to members and retired members of the Armed Services and that Congress and the President should take steps to address `the problems associated with the availability of health care for such retirees within two years.' I authored that resolution, and today in year one of this two-year challenge, my friend and colleague, Senator Kempthorne, Chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I are ready to take the initial steps in fulfilling this obligation to our retirees. 
In March, I hosted a military health care roundtable at Fort Gordon, Georgia. The positive and supportive working relationship between the Eisenhower Army Medical Center and the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia was highlighted by the panel speakers and audience members. These facilities have established a sharing agreement which allows each to provide certain health care services to the beneficiaries of the other. This type of joint approach has the potential to alleviate a significant portion of the accessibility problem faced by military retirees, especially given the reduction in DoD medical treatment facilities. In spite of these benchmarked efforts in cooperative care, beneficiaries who were in the audience still attested to insufficient accessibility to resources to meet their needs. One of the audience participants who was commenting on a health problem stated, `my life isn't the same as it was a year ago, and all I got was shuttled from one thing to another'. 
In a statement I submitted last week, I discussed a legislative initiative which would require the Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to work toward enhancing their cooperative efforts in the delivery of health care to the beneficiaries of these systems. This initiative includes several elements to enhance health care efficiencies. It provides for a study which would determine the demographics, geographic distribution and health care preferences and an assessment of the overall capacity of both systems to treat 
beneficiaries. The second provision would examine existing statutory, regulatory and cultural impediments that are currently precluding the optimal cooperation of DoD and VA in health care delivery. Finally, this initiative provides for the acceleration of several ongoing efforts such as the Electronic Transfer of Patient Information and the DoD/VA Federal Pharmaceutical Steering Committee. This legislative initiative was included in the Fiscal Year 1999 National Defense Authorization Act. 
The legislation I wish to discuss today addresses the retirees who are aged 65 and older. The Government Accounting Office reports that of the population eligible for military health care, approximately 52% are retirees and dependents. Seventy one percent of military retirees are under the age of 65, while 29% of military retirees are aged 65 and older. 
As we consider options for improving the DoD and VA health care systems, we need to be mindful of some basic facts. About 60% of retirees under the age of 65 live near a military treatment facility while only about 52% the retirees aged 65 and older live near such a facility. About two thirds of retirees under the age of 65 use the military health system. In comparison, only about a quarter of the retirees aged 65 and older use military medical facilities, and then only on a space available basis and primarily for pharmacy services. 
According to a 1994-95 survey of DoD beneficiaries, just over 40 percent of military retirees, regardless of age, had private health insurance coverage. About a third of retirees aged 65 and older also reported having additional insurance to supplement their Medicare benefits. This is in part, due to their belief that the military health care system would take care of their needs throughout their lifetime. 
The Military Health System has changed dramatically in recent years. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Warsaw Pact led to a major reassessment of U.S. defense policy. The DoD health care system changes have included the establishment of a managed care program, numerous facility closures, and significant downsizing of military medical staff. In the last decade, the number of military medical personnel has declined by 15 percent and the number of military hospitals has been reduced by one-third. The Fiscal Year 1994 National Defense Authorization Act directed DoD to prescribe and implement a nationwide managed health care benefit program modeled on health maintenance organization plans and in 1995, beneficiaries began enrolling in this new program called TRICARE. With over 8 million beneficiaries, it is the largest health maintenance organization plan in the Nation. 
One of the problems with TRICARE is what happens to retirees when they reach the age of 65. At that point, they are no longer eligible to participate in any TRICARE option. The law currently provides for transition from military health care to Medicare for these beneficiaries. 
Mr. President, this is not the right solution, especially given the fact that Medicare does not currently reimburse the DoD for health care services, although Congress recently authorized a test of this concept, nor does Medicare include a pharmacy benefit. In addition, as the military begins to close and downsize military treatment facilities, retirees aged 65 and older are unable to 
obtain treatment on a space available basis. These retirees are, in effect, being shut out of the medical facilities promised to them. 
The Medicare Subvention demonstration project that is scheduled to begin enrollment in the near future will only benefit retirees who live near military treatment facilities--which is only about half of all retirees. Those retirees living outside catchment areas won't even benefit from subvention. Additionally, there are ongoing efforts to initiate a Veterans Affairs Subvention test. The limiting criteria of these tests is that they require beneficiaries to live near the respective treatment facilities. To accommodate those beneficiaries who do not live near treatment facilities or within a catchment area, we must explore other alternatives, including, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) option that has received so much attention recently. 
There has been an overwhelming outpouring of support for offering FEHBP to military retirees. Although this program has achieved a successful reputation among federal employees, it is a very costly alternative which deserves close scrutiny, along with other health care options. I appreciate the fact that there are many advantages to FEHBP. Furthermore, I share the view that health care for military retirees should be at least as good as the health care we in the Congress afford ourselves. 
However, there may be other options, or a combination of options that will allow us to keep our promises with our older retirees in a fiscally responsible manner. The option I am about to discuss is included in the Fiscal Year 1999 National Defense Authorization Act. Senator Dirk Kempthorne, Chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I have worked closely on this issue over the past several months. Under his leadership, the Personnel Subcommittee held hearings on this issue which included testimony by the service Surgeons Generals, the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, and representatives from military associations. Together, we have developed a plan to assist the Nation in meeting our obligation to the military retirees. 
This legislation requires demonstrations to be conducted of three health care options: the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), TRICARE Standard (which replaced the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services or CHAMPUS), and Mail Order Pharmacy. Two different sites will be selected for each of the respective demonstrations. 
Through FEHBP, military retirees could choose from different plan options. As with active and retired federal employees, military retirees who enrolled would be required to pay a premium. The amount of the premium would vary depending on which plan was chosen and the government and beneficiary share in the cost of the selected plan. 
The TRICARE Standard option would be to extend the current coverage beyond age 64. Under this extension, the TRICARE Standard would serve as a supplemental policy to Medicare, covering most out-of-pocket costs not covered by Medicare. Even though this proposal would require retirees to enroll in Medicare part B, retirees should experience lower out-of-pocket costs. Because TRICARE Standard is an established program within DoD, the existing infrastructure 
could be used without significant increase in administrative costs. 
Finally, the Medicare program does not provide coverage for outpatient prescriptions, a major expense for older people, who tend to use more prescription drugs. Military retirees can get prescriptions filled at military treatment facility pharmacies, but these facilities are not readily accessible to all older retirees. Expanding this mail order benefit to those who do not live near military facilities and do not currently have a mail order benefit would fill an important health care coverage gap. This would be the third demonstration. 
The demonstrations will be scheduled to conclude within the same time frame as the ongoing Medicare Subvention test, approximately January 1, 2001, so all the test results can be simultaneously compared in determining the best option or combination of options to accommodate the retirees aged 65 and older. 
Mr. President, as you know, S. 1334, a bill to provide for a test of FEHBP has 60 cosponsors. We agree that FEHBP warrants further examination which is why we have included it in the Committee's legislative proposal. We are very committed to finding the right solution to this shortcoming which is why we feel that evaluating several options is critical in this decision process. The proposal included in the Defense Authorization Act is far more comprehensive than S. 1334. At the end of these demonstrations, we would have extensive data upon which we could base an informed decision regarding the best way for our Nation to provide health care to those who have earned it through the sacrifices inherent in military service.

Mr. CLELAND. 
Mr. President, I am particularly honored to serve as the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee, a charge I have embraced to its fullest. In the first session of the 105th Congress, I pledged my commitment to improving military health care. Today, I am here to discuss proposals to offer both immediate assistance and a time phased legislative strategy to fulfill this commitment. 
The Fiscal Year 1998 Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 105-85) included a Sense of the Congress Resolution which provided a finding that `many retired military personnel believe that they were promised lifetime health care in exchange for 20 or more years of service,' and expresses the sense of Congress that `the United States has incurred a moral obligation' to provide health care to members and retired members of the Armed Services and that Congress and the President should take steps to address `the problems associated with the availability of health care for such retirees within two years.' I authored that resolution, and today in year one of my two-year challenge, I stand ready to take the first of many necessary steps to fulfill this obligation. 
I call this obligation `K-P Duty'--K-P as in KEEPING PROMISES. As a disabled veteran and retiree, as former head of the Veterans Administration, and as the Ranking Member on the Personnel Subcommittee, I am seeking to draft Congress and the entire nation and put us all on K-P Duty. 
Back when I was in the Army, some saw K-P or `kitchen police' as punishment. If a soldier was derelict in his duties, or if he broke the rules, he went on KP, where he served his fellow soldiers by working in the messhall. 
The K-P Duty I'm talking about is not about punishment, however. Yes, we as a nation have been derelict in our duties to our military personnel, active duty and retired. Yes, we have broken our promises. But the K-P Duty I'm talking about is a sacred honor. It is about a grateful nation paying respect to those soldiers who made tremendous sacrifices for our Country. The soldiers who won World War II, who won the Cold War--the soldiers that have made it possible for the United States to be the world's only super power. It is our time, indeed it is past time, to serve these soldiers and fulfill our obligation. 
As with any draft in an army, the first order of business is bootcamp. As long as I have taken the liberty of drafting the entire Congress, I might as well serve as drill instructor. Let me take this time to `drill' the Senate on the basics of this challenge. 
Not only do we have to fulfill our promise, we also have to reconsider the way in which the military and veterans health care systems work. It is the change in the demographics of military health care beneficiaries that necessitates a change in the way that we administer health care. 
When I went on active duty, the military was made up of mostly single male soldiers. Looking at the all-volunteer, totally-recruited force today, the picture is much different. Now, 57 percent of all enlisted members and 73 percent of all officers are married. Not surprisingly, the number of young dependents has also risen. In terms of recruitment, quality health care is cited as a major incentive for young men and women who join the military. It is that same health care for soldiers and their families that helps retain these soldiers in the military. Recently, I heard the adage, `the military recruits a soldier, but retains a family.' 
Since the time I was a U.S. Army Captain 30 years ago, the number of active duty personnel has undergone a 58 percent reduction. Concurrently, the number of retirees has more than doubled. The Government Accounting Office reports that approximately 48 percent of the beneficiaries of the Department of Defense Military Health System are active duty members and dependents. The remaining 52 % are retirees and dependents. 71% of military retirees are under the age of 65, while 29% of military retirees are over the age of 65. 
As we consider options for improving the DoD and VA health care systems, we need to be mindful of some basic facts. About 60% of retirees under the age 65 live near a military treatment facility but only about 52% the retirees aged 65 and older live near such a facility. About two thirds of retirees under age 65 used the military health system. In comparison, only about a quarter of the retirees aged 65 and older used military medical facilities on a space available basis primarily for pharmacy services. 
According to a 1994-95 survey of DoD beneficiaries, over 40 percent of military retirees, regardless of age, had private health insurance coverage. About a third of retirees aged 65 and older also reported having additional insurance to supplement their Medicare benefits. Approximately 14% of retirees under age 65 had insurance to supplement their CHAMPUS coverage. 
In this same dynamic environment of the past 30 years, the medical portion of the DoD budget has increased dramatically from approximately two percent to six percent. In part, this can be attributed to cost growth from technology and intensity of treatment in the private and public sectors. It is interesting to note the converse relationship between the increase in health care dollars as the number of active duty personnel decreases and the number of retirees increases. 
The Military Health System (MHS) and the Veterans Health Administration are well established institutions that collectively manage over 1500 hospitals, clinics, and health care facilities world-wide, providing services to over 11 million beneficiaries. Overseeing these systems requires a well-planned and executed effort. 
The Veterans Health Administration is a system in transition. In the past two years, the VA has replaced its structure of four regions, 33 networks, and hundreds of clinics with a new system geared to decentralizing authority into 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks. The purpose of the reorganization was to improve the access, quality and efficiency of care provided to the Nation's veterans. The hallmark of the network structure is that the field has been given control over functions which were previously located in Washington. The majority of quality-related activities were transferred closer to the site of patient care. 
The Military Health System has also changed. During the Cold War, that system was designed to support full-scale, extremely violent war with the Soviet Union and its allies in Europe. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Warsaw Pact led to a major reassessment of the U.S. defense policy. The overall size of the active duty force has been reduced by one-third since the mid-1980s. 
The DoD health care system changes have included the establishment of a managed care program, numerous facility closures, and significant downsizing of military medical staff. In the last decade, the number of military medical 
personnel has declined by 15 percent and the number of military hospitals has been reduced by one-third. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 directed DoD to prescribe and implement a nationwide managed health care benefit program modeled on health maintenance organization plans and in 1995, beneficiaries began enrolling in this new program called TRICARE. With over 8 million beneficiaries, it is the largest health maintenance organization plan in the Nation. 
One of the problems with TRICARE is what happens to retirees when they reach the age of 65. They are ineligible to participate in TRICARE. The law currently provides for transition from military health care to Medicare for these beneficiaries. This is not the right solution, especially given the fact that Medicare does not currently reimburse the DoD for health care services, although Congress recently authorized a test of this concept. In addition, as the military begins to close and downsize military treatment facilities, retirees over 65 are unable to seek and obtain treatment on a space available basis. The retirees over 65 are, in effect, being shut out of the medical facilities promised to them. 
The changing health care environment has created its own set of unique challenges. To assess these varied and special requirements, I formed a Military Health Care Reform Working Group of senior officials in government and the private sector to explore innovative solutions to improve the military and veterans health care systems. During the past few months this group analyzed the array of military and veterans health care issues and recently provided a comprehensive report of their findings and recommendations to me. 
In March, I hosted a military health care roundtable at Fort Gordon, Georgia. The positive and supportive working relationship between the Eisenhower Army Medical Center and the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia was highlighted by the panel speakers and audience members. These facilities have established a sharing agreement which allows each to provide certain health care services to the beneficiaries of the other. This type of joint approach has the potential to alleviate a significant portion of the accessibility problem faced by military retirees, especially given the reduction in DoD medical treatment facilities. In spite of these benchmarked efforts in cooperative care, beneficiaries who were in the audience still attested to insufficient accessibility to resources to meet their needs. 
Public Law 97-174, `The Veterans Administration and Department of Defense Health Resources Sharing and Emergency Operations Act,' was enacted in 1982 specifically to promote cost-effective use of federal health care resources by minimizing duplication and underuse of health care resources while benefitting both VA and DoD beneficiaries. Under this law, VA and DoD pursue programs of cooperation ranging from shared services to joint venture operations of medical facilities. Sharing agreements are developed on a local basis, whereas, joint ventures are developed at the highest levels within an organization or command. 
In 1984, there were a combined total of 102 VA and DoD facilities with sharing agreements. By 1997, that number had grown to 420. In five years, between FY 1992 and FY 1997, shared services increased from slightly over 3,000 to more than 6,000 services ranging from major medical and surgical services, laundry, blood, and laboratory services to unusual speciality care services. VA and DoD currently have four joint ventures in operation in New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, Oklahoma, and four more in planning for Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, California. 
In my opening remarks, I suggested that there are things that we can do immediately and others that can be accomplished through a near term time phased legislative strategy to fulfill our moral obligation to active duty and retired service personnel. Let me first discuss some of the options. 
There has been an overwhelming outpouring of support for offering Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) to military retirees. Although this program has achieved a successful reputation among federal employees, it is a costly alternative which necessitates close scrutiny, along with other health care options. I appreciate the fact that there are many advantages to FEHBP. Furthermore, I share the view that health care for military retirees should be at least as good as the health care we in the Congress afford ourselves. I am committed to working closely on the FEHBP option. 
The Medicare Subvention demonstration project that is scheduled to begin enrollment in the near future involves TRICARE Prime. Unfortunately, it will only benefit retirees who live near military treatment facilities--which is only about half of all retirees. Those retirees living outside catchment areas won't benefit from subvention. Additionally, there are ongoing efforts to initiate a Veterans Affairs Subvention test. The limiting criteria of these tests is that they require beneficiaries to live near the respective treatment facilities. To accommodate those beneficiaries that do not live near treatment facilities or within the catchment area, we must explore other alternatives, including, as I mentioned, the FEHBP option. 
Today, I am announcing two initiatives. The first is a bill to require the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to significantly enhance their cooperative efforts in the delivery of health care to their respective beneficiaries. Several measures to enhance military health care efficiencies are already being explored, and the initiative I am proposing would complement these efforts without any direct impact on current spending. Let me just highlight some of the elements of my plan. 
The first element directs DoD and the VA to conduct a comprehensive survey to determine the demographics of their beneficiaries, their geographic distribution, and their preferences for health care. A second survey would review the range of existing DoD and VA facilities and resources and the capacity available for cooperative efforts. The purpose of these reviews is simple. We need to accurately determine who we are serving, what they want, and what resources we currently have to provide to them. 
The second element directs DoD and the VA to provide to the Congress a report on any and all impediments which preclude optimal cooperation and/or integration between DoD and VA in the area of health care delivery. We need to know what statutory restrictions, regulatory constraints, and cultural issues stand in the way of full and complete cooperation between the two departments. They would be directed to recommend to the Congress what changes should be made in the law. Furthermore, they would be directed to eliminate any regulatory and cultural impediments. 
The third element addresses several projects that have been undertaken by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs that can be accelerated for near term implementation. The Electronic Transfer of Patient Information, a collaborative effort by DoD and VA which would provide for immediate transfer of and access to patient records at the time of treatment is a project which merits Congressional support. The DoD and VA have also established the DoD/VA Federal Pharmaceutical Steering Committee. I believe this committee should perform a comprehensive examination of existing pharmaceutical benefits and programs, including current management and utilization of mail order pharmaceuticals. Finally, the initiative directs DoD to review the extent of VA participation in TRICARE networks and to take steps to ensure optimal participation by the VA. 
The second initiative I am announcing today is legislation which is being crafted to respond to the tremendous outcry to provide health care for military retirees over 65. Mr. President, as you know, S. 1334, a bill to provide for a test of the FEHBP plan has 60 cosponsors. It is my plan to work with my friend and colleague Senator Kempthorne in the Senate Armed Services Committee to include in the National Defense Authorization bill a proposal that addresses this matter this year. 
I recognize that there is a perception that our military benefits are eroding but I am here today to say that we can change this perception if we all do our share on K-P Duty. Greater cooperation among the DoD and VA will yield greater choices for the beneficiaries of these systems. Developing a viable health care alternative for our retirees over 65, a group that has been largely disenfranchised, will ensure that now all beneficiaries have access to the health care to which they are entitled because of their service to this Nation. 
We made a promise, now let's keep it. It is as simple as that.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am honored to have the opportunity to engage in this debate over the proposed expansion of the NATO treaty. It is an important occasion for this body, for our country, and for the shape of the post-cold war world. To quote Emerson, who had in turn been quoted by the great American statesman Dean Acheson about the dawning of the post-World War II era, `we are present at the sowing of the seed of creation.' 
It is a debate which has properly engaged the best minds in American foreign and national security policy. George Kennan, the architect of the successful `containment' strategy with which NATO won the cold war, has said, 
Expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era. Such a decision may be expected to inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the Cold War to East-West relations; and to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking. 
That is the quote of Mr. Kennan. My predecessor, and someone whose views on national security matters I most value, former Senator Sam Nunn, has said, `NATO expansion makes our security problems more difficult,' and Senator Nunn cowrote a recent magazine article with former Senator Howard Baker, Alton Frye and Brent Scowcroft which states that, `by premature action on new members, the Senate could condemn a vital alliance to creeping impotence.' 
On the other hand, the architect of America's detente strategy, Henry Kissinger, testified to our Senate Armed Services Committee that, 
Failure to expand NATO is likely to prove irrevocable. Russian opposition is bound to grow as its economy gains strength; the nations of Central Europe may drift out of their association with Europe. The end result would be the vacuum between Germany and Russia that has tempted so many previous conflicts. When NATO recoils from defining the only limits that make strategic sense, it is opting for progressive irrelevance. 
And Zbigniew Brzezinski, with whom I served in the Carter Administration, has testified that, 
NATO enlargement has global significance--it is central to the step-by-step construction of a secure international system in which the Euroatlantic alliance plays the major role in ensuring that a peaceful and democratic Europe is America's principal partner. 
Mr. President, these are strong and important words from some of our country's premier experts on international 
relations, and of course they point the Senate in diametrically opposite directions in the current debate. However, and I will return to this point later, in my view they all raise the right questions and ultimately can help point us in the right direction as we take up the critical questions of whether NATO and whether Europe will remain with us regardless of what we do on the pending resolution of ratification. Though I certainly acknowledge the importance of the impending decision, I would counsel that we not engage in exaggeration or hyperbole about the consequences of this single choice. It is but the first, and in my opinion probably not the most important, question we must answer as we feel our way in this unknown `new world order,' and no one, and certainly not this Senator, knows for certain how the future will unfold in Russia, or in the rest of Europe, for that matter. 
So I welcome and I appreciate the thoughtful commentary which has been submitted on both sides of this issue. I have benefited from it, and I certainly believe that neither side has a corner on wisdom or concern for our future security. In this same spirit, I would like to thank the distinguished Majority Leader for responding to two requests I made, one in a letter I co-signed with a number of other Senators on March 3, and the other in a personal note I sent to him on March 25, that he delay final Senate action on the resolution of ratification to allow for more debate, and for more information to be obtained on several important policy questions. While I thought, and think, that for a variety of reasons, it would be better to delay this vote until the beginning of June, I appreciate the postponement he did arrange because it allowed me to make my own `inspection tour' of Europe to assess the situation there in person on the ground. 
I have just completed a twelve day, 12,000 mile tour of Europe. My travels took me to London, Camp Robertson, V Corps Headquarters and Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany, and NATO Headquarters in Belgium. They also took me to Eagle Base in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On my trip, I tried to get a realistic look at our Western alliance as we approach the end of the 20th Century. Our relations with our European allies, particularly through NATO, are of special importance to the United States. As I have already indicated, the issue of NATO expansion to nations formerly a part of the Warsaw Pact, especially the pending proposal to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in NATO, is 
of paramount importance as we consider the crucial matter of the future of the Western alliance in this body. 
During my journey, I also attempted to get a feel for the disposition and readiness of our military forces in Europe, and the attitude and morale of our troops deployed on our expeditionary mission to Bosnia. 
Any attempt at gaging the temperature of our NATO alliance must begin with a sense of European history. President Kennedy once said that the thing that he cherished most in the White House was `a sense of history,' and the thing he feared most was `human miscalculation.' I had the same feeling as I toured Europe. In order for us to not miscalculate in terms of our diplomatic and military policy in these areas, we must have a sense of history of the region. Winston Churchill once observed about the value of history that, `One can not know where one is going unless one knows where one has been.' This is certainly true in Europe. 
To illustrate the lessons of history, I have in mind a trip I took to the Waterloo battlefield in Belgium made famous by Napoleon's encounter with the Duke of Wellington there in 1815. In addition to some fascinating lessons regarding battlefield tactics which created 48,000 casualties in one afternoon, I gained some other valuable insights which I think are instructive as we approach the NATO expansion debate. 
One lesson that I learned was that although Napoleon had great loyalty from his band of seasoned veterans who had marched with him through the various Napoleonic wars which had plagued Europe until 1815, by the time of Waterloo he was actually outnumbered 3 to 1. Europe had finally coalesced against him. At a crucial moment in the battle, it was a Prussian commander who brought his forces from as far away as Austria and Germany to come decisively to the aid of Wellington. The Prussian commander massed his forces to help Wellington defeat Napoleon's Grand Armee and the Napoleonic Guards. The lesson for me is clear. Europe has been swept over by one conqueror or another ever since Roman Times. But, when European nations form a strong alliance, they can defeat any enemy. 
I think this is an important lesson in history to apply to our present day 
understanding of Europe, particularly in terms of our NATO alliance. In this century from time to time, Germany, then Russia, has tried to dominate Western and Eastern Europe. Each time, alliances were formed against the hostile force. NATO, the most successful European alliance in history, will celebrate its fiftieth anniversary next year. It is not surprising to me that Western Europe, primarily because of NATO, has seen its longest extended peace in centuries. 
Another lesson of history I learned on this trip was the importance of American leadership in helping Europe form alliances that protect it from invasion without and turmoil within. It was after all a British leader across the channel, Wellington, who acted as a catalyst to lead the disparate nations of continental Europe to defeat Napoleon. That was in the last century. This century, it has been an ally across the Atlantic, America, who has led the disparate nations of Europe in an alliance to defeat those who would conquer it. Beginning in World War I, throughout World War II, during the Berlin Airlift, and, finally, through to the conclusion of the Cold War, America has been a catalyst in bringing European nations together to defend and protect our shared interests. American leadership and American guarantees of security with commitment of our forces on the ground in Europe has provided what one French diplomat called an `insurance policy' that if things go wrong on the continent `America will come.' 
As America approaches the close of this century and the dawn of the next, our nation finds itself fully engaged, committed and involved in the life of Europe. Our diplomats, politicians and military forces are stretched over the continent. They provide a level of diplomatic clout and military force projection second to none. America in this part of the world is looked upon as an honest broker in dealing with age-old European factional disputes. The security and stability in Europe since WWII principally guaranteed by NATO is the prime reason Europe is the number one trading and investment partner of the United States today. Increasingly, as the European Union develops, forms its own currency and expands its influence into Eastern European countries, it will become the largest economic trader and investment block on the planet. As America enters into the 21st Century, we will have an opportunity to expand our trans-Atlantic trading and investment partnerships to an extent hitherto unknown to us. 
Make no mistake about it, this opportunity for record economic growth, and the opportunity to spread the gospel of free market economics and the benefits of trade, travel and commerce, has come about because European states, and especially newly independent Eastern European nations, now perceive themselves at the dawn of a new era of peace and stability. They are, 
indeed, `present at the sowing of the seed of creation.' 
Russia has imploded. The Soviet Empire is no more. Where Russia goes from here is anybody's guess. Churchill once described Russia as `a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.' The mystery of where Russia is headed is still with us. We in this country and our European allies wish our Russian friends well. Through the Partnership for Peace, the Founding Act and other entities, we as a matter of policy want to pursue a future based on cooperation rather than conflict. As a democracy ourselves, we in the United States wish the Democratic movements in Russia Godspeed. As a market economy, we believe our type of economic freedom, which brings with it the blessings of growth and opportunity, will sooner or later take hold in Russia as it has in other parts of the world. Democratic notions such as the rule of law, civilian control of the military and human rights now penetrate the thickest of barriers and the strongest of curtains. We know, too, it will take time for these principles to grow naturally in Russia. Many of us feel strongly that Russia will sooner or later make it through this very difficult transitional period. No one knows, however, how long that will take. 
Whatever the future of Russia, the future of Eastern Europe is more and more clear. One of the most powerful messages I received on my trip is that there is a new era of hope and opportunity dawning in Eastern Europe. Long denied by the Cold War, a host of Eastern European countries now see an opportunity for their moment in the sun. This is particularly the case for the states who have been invited to join NATO--Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. A short time ago, the Parliament in the Czech Republic overwhelmingly voted to join NATO. As the vote was declared, the entire body stood up and applauded. As the great 19th Century French writer Victor Hugo observed, `An invasion of armies can be resisted, but not an idea whose time has come.' The nations of Eastern Europe are emerging into the light after fifty years of the Cold War. The notion that they and their people can enjoy the stability and prosperity experienced by Western Europe is an idea whose time has come. 
Certainly, one of the great challenges currently facing NATO is the issue of Bosnia. On my recent trip, I had the marvelous opportunity to fly on a helicopter to an American outpost--Camp Bedrock--in Bosnia on Easter Sunday. 
It was near Tuzla in Northeast Bosnia. While flying over the countryside, it seemed I was watching a colorized version of a World War II documentary about war-torn Europe. I saw portions of villages burned to the ground. I had not seen such devastation since I was in Vietnam thirty years ago. On my visit, I got a chance to visit American forces in Bosnia. I found them surprisingly cheerful and confident in their mission of peace-keeping in that war-weary countryside. I'm very proud of our forces. They are paying a personal price every day in risking their lives on our behalf. 
When I returned from my trip, I received an e-mail from one of the servicemen I spent Easter Sunday with in Bosnia. He wrote:  
My name is First Lieutenant Brian Brandt. We met today and shook hands in the mess hall here on Eagle Base, Bosnia. I would like to thank you for visiting and sharing in our Easter Mass . . . The greatest burden on today's soldiers is being asked to do more with less and our frequent deployments away from home. I am an OCS graduate and have 14 years of service. In this time I have seen many good and bad things within our services. As we move into the next century I hope we don't find ourselves short. No amount of peace or technology can make up for an Army of over tasked and under trained soldiers. Please carry this message with you to Congress. 
A few days after I visited Camp Bedrock, I was in Brussels. An American businessman approached me and asked me if I had `hope' about Bosnia. I had to reply, `Yes.' I have hope because I believe Europe has learned some painful lessons over the last two centuries. One of those lessons is that alliances--whether against Napoleon, Hitler or Stalin--can win. Secondly, I have hope because Americans have learned some lessons about European history as well. Particularly, I think we've learned one of the lessons about American involvement on the European continent. The lesson is this: `Pay me now, or pay me later.' In other words, we as a nation are involved in Europe--militarily, economically, culturally. Better to get in on the takeoff before it turns into a `crash landing!' Better to work through the European Alliance, in particular through NATO, to prevent a conflict than to risk that conflict turning into a greater confrontation or, even worse, war itself. 
The European community proved incapable of reaching the necessary consensus to act decisively in Bosnia. The U.N. tried to control the tensions but was neither trained nor equipped for the task, even though a limited number of European nations 
were supportive. Finally, under American leadership NATO stepped in. With its command and control systems well established, with its alliance relationships previously worked out over the years, it was able to field a stabilization force which has succeeded beyond the wildest expectations for it. In Bosnia, the NATO alliance now works with non NATO members, including Russia for a combined alliance of 37 nations. 
That's why the killing has stopped. 
That's why troops and tanks have been disarmed. 
That's why minefields are being dismantled. 
That's why refugees are returning. 
That's why elections are being held. 
That's why war criminals are being identified and hauled before an international tribunal. That's why further excesses of any warring party--as in Kosovo--bring immediate international outrage. 
That's why those who perpetrated war are now hunted down and discredited. 
That's why political moderates are coming to the fore and condemning the extremists. 
The effort in Bosnia involves the largest alliance of nations ever to coalesce against a common enemy on the continent of Europe. Maybe we've learned and acquired a sense of history after all. 
I applaud all the members of the alliance for their contributions to peace and stability in Bosnia, particularly the NATO members, and especially the Russians, for coming together in a unified effort to prevent further bloodshed, enhance stability and pave a pathway for peace. I hope it is a harbinger of good things to come in the next century in terms of enhanced cooperation and communications among our countries for the betterment of mankind. 
I especially want to applaud our American servicemen and women and their American military commanders who are working to bring peace and stability in Bosnia. They are working in a tasking and demanding environment filled with diplomatic and military minefields. Special thanks go to General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who came with his wife and joined me for Easter Sunday services with the troops in Tuzla. He joined me and Congressman Patrick Kennedy, a respected member of the U.S. House National Security Committee, for a very special Easter Mass in a Catholic Chapel. A particular responsibility rests on the shoulders of U.S. General Wes Clark, the top NATO Commander. His diplomatic and military skills 
have been tested to the maximum, and have been put in full play to hold the NATO Alliance together militarily in a challenging environment in the Balkans. A dear friend and a great Georgian, LTG Jay Hendrix, commands the U.S. Army V Corps out of Germany. He faces the daunting challenge of deploying and replacing the troops in the Bosnian expedition. General Eric Shinseki is the overall commander of all military forces on the ground in Bosnia. He has a tough task in Sarajevo. Major General Larry Ellis is the `muddy boots general' on the ground in Tuzla who musters the morale of all of his forces, and is doing a great job in the American sector. All of the men and women involved in this effort are a credit to the United States, the European Alliance and the cause of human dignity and freedom in the Balkans. I am proud of them all. I will support continued funding of their efforts to bring peace and stability to this troubled part of our world. 
A proper consideration of the issue of NATO expansion requires consideration of American, as well as European, history. As I discussed earlier, the leading voices on American foreign policy currently offer divided counsel on this issue. It is obvious that no clear consensus has yet formed as to America's post-Cold War strategy. 
This lies in stark contrast to previous eras in our history when our approach to the world has generally been guided by a unifying vision. In our earliest days, we were galvanized by seeking to gain our independence. Then Manifest Destiny took hold as we boldly expanded westward into frontier country. During the same time, the Monroe Doctrine guided our relations with Europe and Latin America. This period was interrupted by the Civil War and the painful Reconstruction Era. As the United States entered the 20th Century and Americans turned toward commerce, the industrial revolution made its biggest impact on American economic development. This Gilded Age saw the rise of the Labor movement, the Depression and set the foundation for the New Deal. 
Throughout all of this time, it would be fair to sum up our general philosophy on foreign policy as an attempt to continue to follow President Washington's recommended approach, contained in his Farewell Address of September 17, 1796: 
Observe good faith and justice toward all nations. Cultivate peace and harmony with all . . . The Nation which indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest . . . Steer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world . . . There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. 
That approach changed when, following the two great 20th Century world wars and alternating cycles of isolationism and engagement, America emerged as the major global economic and military power. We then became united around the fight against Communism which, in the form of the Soviet Union, posed the only grave threat to our physical survival we have ever faced. The Cold War guided our thinking, and NATO was the main military expression of that strategic vision. 
Now we are in a new era. No one has quite coined the term for it. Some call it the `New World Order,' but I prefer to call it The Age of Democracy. What I find different and indeed magical about this new era is the fact that while it brings with it the spread of democracy and democratic principles around the world to places that have been burdened by tyranny, it is doing so not through the threat of force, but through the promise of peace. However, thus far we are not in consensus on how we shape our national security policies to meet the challenges of the new era. 
I believe the critics of the proposed expansion of NATO are right when they focus on the need for policies which draw Russia into cooperation rather than confrontation with the United States and the West. From the control of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons proliferation to containment of Saddam Hussein, to the termination of the Cold War legacy of Mutual and Assured Destruction, the participation and cooperation of Russia is of vital importance in securing this peaceful Age of Democracy which we are entering. 
I also believe the critics are right that we are going to have to be extremely careful in when and how we approach consideration of inclusion of the Baltic states and former Soviet Republics in NATO or any other unified military command structure. 
And, over the long-term, I believe the critics are right that it is the expansion of the European Union, and its ultimate promise of what Churchill called a `United States of Europe,' which offers the strongest foundation for Eastern European economic and political development, and for Europe at long last being able to be fully responsible for its own security. 
However, after much reflection and after having seen the `ground truth' on my recent trip, I have concluded that supporters of NATO expansion are absolutely correct that other than NATO there is no entity at present which is able to step up to the plate and fill the security void that currently exists in Central Europe. The European Union is currently considering the proposed admission of six nations, including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, plus Slovenia, Cyprus and Estonia, but that process is likely to take until 2003, at the earliest. Furthermore, the Union has a number of important questions, such as its decision-making process and the division of sovereignty between it and its component nations, which must be worked out before it can offer an effective voice on foreign and defense policies. 
As for Russia, I believe we must make every effort to seek cooperative and mutually beneficial relations. Regardless of how the Senate votes with respect to the pending treaty, I believe supporters of NATO enlargement are correct that we and the Russians will have the same set of mutual interests to work for; namely, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and stability around Russia's borders in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. We should see what the future brings in Russia, with the European Union, and with all of the former members of the Warsaw Pact before we decide the next steps with respect to NATO, including both its membership and mission. 
It is in this context that I as a member of this body consider the issue before the Senate of expanding the NATO treaty to include the nations of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. For a long time I have asked myself the question, `Can we afford it?' As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I've heard witness after witness question the wisdom of expanding NATO, particularly at this time and especially in terms of the painful transition going on in Russia today. I have also heard NATO enlargement questioned from a budgetary point of view in terms of its cost to American taxpayers. In the wake of what I've learned on my trip, however, I now ask myself, `Can we afford not to do it?' 
I've concluded that Russia will do whatever it is going to do. We can encourage cooperation. We can support democratic principles and human rights. We can move forward with arms control agreements, especially Start II and move on to Start III. These are critical items on the American agenda, and critical items on the Russian agenda as well. We must 
move forcefully in expanding consultation and cooperation on all these fronts. 
But, we in this country must heed the call of the Eastern European nations for help in fulfilling their destiny. Their destiny is with the West, as is Russia's destiny one day. In my view, the expansion into the Eastern European community by the Western European community through the expansion of NATO, and a gesture of cooperation to the Russians through the Partnership for Peace and the Founding Act is a plus, not a minus, for our national security. The good news is that so many people in Eastern Europe and Russia want to identify with the West. They want the peace and prosperity offered by Western European ideas and values and Western European organizations. It is for this reason that I intend to vote for NATO expansion. I believe, as Prime Minister Tony Blair said in going to Northern Ireland after I had a brief meeting with him, `I feel the hand of history on my shoulders. I have hope. I have faith. I don't know how it will work out, but I must try.' 
No one can know for certain how NATO expansion will work out, and I certainly believe we must make our future decisions based on what experience teaches, but in this current decision I think the hand of history is on our shoulders. I think we must work in faith and hope. I think we must try. I don't know how the future of Russia will unfold, but I think it is important for the Western community of nations led by the United States, in the spirit of friendship and cooperation, to reach out in faith and hope to the Eastern European nations, and try to help them create a new future for themselves. 
On my recent trip, I visited an American battlefield cemetery. The place was the famous Flanders Fields Cemetery in Belgium. It was a Canadian, Colonel John McCrae, who wrote the famous poem about World War I, `In Flanders Fields.' Colonel McCrae was later killed in that War. But he challenged all of us for the rest of this century to live up to the hope that the soldiers in that war had that their sacrifice in bringing peace and stability in Europe would not be in vain. As I laid a wreath at the cemetery, I thought of all those in this century since World War I who have given their lives for peace and prosperity in Europe. I support the pending NATO enlargement as a further expansion of a peace process that began with American involvement in World War I at Flanders Fields, and continues until this day. Surely we have learned some lessons of history this century that will 
keep us from miscalculating. Surely we do not want to repeat the mistakes of this century in the next. 
Mr. President, I learned many lessons on this trip. The most important lesson I learned, however, is that American men and women deployed in Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the Balkans are making a positive difference in the lives of millions of people in those parts of the world. Our American diplomats, soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, guardsmen are our greatest asset. They spread American values and ideals wherever they go because they treat people with dignity. They talk the talk. They also walk the walk. 
More than anything I learned on my trip, Mr. President, is that the legacy of American involvement in Western and Eastern Europe in this century has been a courageous and positive one. It is because of our people who have given their lives and risked their reputations this century in the cause of peace, stability, freedom, human rights, the rule of law, civilian control of the military, economic justice and democratic ideals that America plays such a strong hand in diplomatic and military missions throughout Europe. That story is not lost on nations further East, including Russia and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. 
I returned from my trip to Europe and Bosnia even more proud of my country and our ideals than when I left. As a new century dawns, I'm sure Americans will learn from history and not miscalculate. At this moment in history, we are the key players in the progress of a European Alliance, especially NATO, and we should be a key player when the Alliance expands into Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. While I believe we must constantly seek emerging answers on such key questions as the security situation in the Baltic States, the evolution of the European Union, the political situation in Russia, and the impact on the readiness of American military forces, and should be prepared to guide our future policy choices based on those answers, I support the proposed first round of NATO expansion. As the only currently available alternative, I also support funding for a follow-on-force in Bosnia. As our troops and diplomats do their duty, they can count on support from this Senator. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and commend the National Order of Women Legislators and the Georgia Chapter of the National Order of Women Legislators as they celebrate today 60 years of accomplishments since the organization was founded in 1938. 
This year also marks the 150th Anniversary of the first Women's Rights Convention ever held to discuss the prohibitions then in force on women voting, holding public office, owning property, signing official documents, and receiving a formal education. 
The women who have served in the National Order of Women Legislators and the Georgia Chapter of that organization have overcome gender barriers and are true champions of the women's rights movement. I applaud these women for fighting for and delivering to the women of this nation the right to vote, and a vital voice in local, state and national government. 
The Declaration of Sentiments issued by the 1848 convention held in Seneca Falls, New York, launched a movement that unleashed and enhanced the myriad of talents and intellectual abilities already possessed by women throughout the United States. The resulting Women's Rights Movement has had a profound and undeniable impact on all aspects of American life, and has opened new and well deserved opportunities for women. 
I would especially like to commend the spirit and hard work of Rebecca Latimer Felton, the first Georgia woman elected to the United States Senate in 1992, two years after women gained the right to vote; Florence Reville Gibbs, the first Georgia woman to serve in the United States House of Representatives (1940-1941); Viola Ross Napier, the first woman to serve in the Georgia House of Representatives (1923-1926); Susie Tilman Moore, the first woman to serve in the Georgia State Senate (1933-1934 and 1939-1940); and Grace Towns Hamilton, the first African American woman elected to the Georgia House of Representatives (1966-1984). 
I am honored to serve in the United States Senate with nine remarkable female Senators--Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL), Patty Murray (D-WA), and Olympia Snowe (R-ME). I also commend the 55 female members of the U.S. House of Representatives and female members in the Georgia State Legislature. 
Members of National Order of Women Legislators serve as role models for women throughout this nation and the entire world. I ask my colleagues to join me today in saluting and congratulating the National Order of Women Legislators and the Georgia Chapter of the National Order of Women Legislators for setting a positive example to all Americans.

Mr. CLELAND. Thank you, very much. 
Mr. President, I would like to commend the senior Senator from Georgia, my dear colleague and friend, Senator Coverdell, for his stick-to-itiveness in bringing this issue to the floor of the U.S. Senate. He has worked hard on the Parent and Student Savings Account Act. This bill is the product of many long hours of hard work and compromise and collaboration, and Senator Torricelli and other members of the Finance Committee deserve praise for bringing this issue to the floor. 
I would like to state for the record that I had planned to support final passage of the Parent and Student Savings Account (PLUS) Act as reported out of Committee. In addition to the education savings account provision in the bill, H.R. 2646 contains a number of measures that further increase education opportunities for students, including the expansion of employer-provided education assistance to cover graduate courses, an allowance for individuals to make withdrawals from State tuition program accounts on a tax-free basis, and a provision providing an increase in the small issuer rebate exception for bonds used to finance school construction, all of which I strongly support. 
And I also support the education savings account provisions, especially the expansion of the credit for savings for college education, which have caused most of the controversy on the bill. While the Parent and Student Savings Account (PLUS) Act as reported by Committee was a modest and moderate bill and certainly was not the final answer to the education problems currently facing our country, I believe that by making additional resources available for education this bill represented a step forward and I had every intention of supporting it. 
Unfortunately, yesterday the Senate voted, by a one vote margin, to attach an amendment to this bill which I can not support, and which is neither modest nor moderate in impact. Senator Gorton's block grant amendment greatly concerns me and I believe that it is a risky experiment that will undermine the legitimate, but limited, federal role in support of public education. 
Senator Gorton's amendment would block grant funds for about one-third of the programs administered by the Education Department including those for bilingual education, Title I programs which are targeted to poor, disadvantaged school districts, Safe and Drug-free Schools, and education technology. Some of these programs date back to the Eisenhower Administration. We cannot turn back the clock on programs such as these. The Gorton amendment will undermine the federal commitment to improve the nation's schools and opens the doors for abandonment of national commitments to disadvantaged and disabled students and other priorities established over the years by a bipartisan consensus in Congress. 
In spite of the fact that this idea was first advanced many months ago when the Senate took up last year's education appropriations bill, no hearings have been held on this block grant proposal nor has there been any committee review of its impact. As I stated earlier, this amendment affects one- 
third of the federal education programs and would, in effect, radically restructure the administration of over $10 billion of federal education dollars. I believe that it is premature and irresponsible for this body to pass legislation that would make such sweeping changes to the federal role in education based on thirty minutes of debate. 
As a strong supporter of state and local decision-making I fully support our current educational system which vests most authority for education at the level of government closest to students and parents, usually local school boards, with the federal role largely limited to the provision of supplemental financial assistance. However, I also believe that federal involvement, while limited, is necessary and that the Department of Education provides an appropriate oversight function to ensure basic educational standards, civil rights protections, program quality safeguards as well as overall accountability. 
I realize that there are many problems with today's schools. Our schools and our children, unfortunately, mirror many of the problems of our times. Drugs, gangs and weapons have infiltrated many of our schools and are adversely affecting our children. Student educational attainment is too low in far too many of our school systems. Combating these problems will take the best efforts of parents, teachers, administrators and governments at the local, state and federal level. 
In addition to Senator Gorton's amendment I also am very concerned about Senator Ashcroft's amendment which will prohibit spending Federal education funds on national testing. I believe that voluntary national achievement tests will empower parents and local school districts to assess how well their students are performing. Such measures will give parents insight into how their children are doing and how well their children's school is doing. From the voluntary tests, we will be able to determine if a child needs help, if a class needs help and if a school needs help. In direct conflict with the bipartisan compromise on national testing so painstakingly crafted last year, the Ashcroft Amendment will deny states and localities the right to utilize voluntary national tests to measure student learning and improve education so that all students will meet high academic standards, particularly in math and reading. 
Again, I would like to reiterate that I would have voted for the Committee-approved version of H.R. 2646, which was a modest and moderate pro-education bill. However, due to the adoption of the block grant and national testing amendments, in my view the current version of this legislation does more harm than good and I cannot in good conscience vote for it. 
I say to Senator Coverdell, who has put in many, many hours on behalf of this legislation, if these objectionable amendments are removed in conference, and I hope they will be, I will be pleased to vote for the conference report. 
I thank the Chair.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it is an honor today to celebrate the 47th Wedding Anniversary of Dr. Lloyd John and Mary Jane Ogilvie. It gives me great pleasure to congratulate them on their momentous and joyful day. 
March 25, 1951, our Senate Chaplain and love of his life took their vows to become man and wife. This month marks 47 years of sharing their lives, dreams, work, struggles, laughs and tears, and commitment to each other. The Ogilvies were blessed with three children, Heather, Scott and Andrew, and are also the proud grandparents of four wonderful grandchildren, Erin, Airley, Bonnier and Scotter. 
In an era where marriages are too often short lived, it is wonderful to see a couple who has endured the trials and tribulations that plague so many of today's marriage. The love and commitment they have demonstrated over the years should serve as an inspiration to us all. 
Mr. President, I ask that you join me, our colleagues, and the entire Ogilvie family in recognizing the wonderful sense of achievement and happiness that marks the occasion of 47 years of marriage. I congratulate and offer best wishes on many more years of matrimonial bliss to my dear friends, the Ogilvies.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps. 
In March 1933, there were approximately 13,689,000 Americans unemployed. Millions were standing in bread lines, or desperately pleading with community volunteer organizations for help. Thousands were making homes out of abandoned farm buildings, or just roaming around the land with no home at all. 
At this time, my home state of Georgia had already known `depression' for some time. An economic recession had begun in Georgia 10 years before the stock market crashed in 1929. Farmers had already faced a century of troubles including erosion problems, and a boll weevil epidemic that wiped out cotton crops across the state. 
Who would have thought that Georgians' great hope would come in the form of a New Yorker, stricken by polio, who had sought out the healing Warm Springs of Georgia nearly ten years earlier. It was the frequent Georgia visitor President Franklin D. Roosevelt who looked out on America and said he saw `one third of a nation ill-clad, ill-housed and ill-nourished.' In response, he offered the people of a suffering nation a sweeping bundle of proposals--a New Deal. 
A cornerstone of FDR's initiative was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which was signed into law on April 5, 1933. 
Conceived as an employment catalyst for young men, Roosevelt said his idea was `to create a civilian conservation corps, to be used in simple work, not interfering with normal employment, but confining itself to forestry, the prevention of soil erosion, flood control and similar projects.' 
By the summer of 1933, the CCC had more than 300,000 young men, ages 18 to 24, in camps across the country prepared to embark on what would be the largest public works and job creation project this country has ever known. In a radio address that summer, President Roosevelt called on the CCC to be the vanguard of the new spirit of the American future--a spirit of responsibility and opportunity. 
My father was one of the young men who heard that call. A year later, in the summer of 1934, my father was a `CCC boy' based in a Clayton County camp as a truck driver, running supplies to camps in North Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. The CCC boys earned $30 per month running supplies like my father, planting trees, building roads and trails, making dams and walls and shelters. 
Roosevelt's Corps was dedicated to several purposes. First, FDR created the CCC to relieve the massive unemployment problem our nation was facing. Second, FDR recognized the real work the CCC could do--rebuilding the country's depleted resources of forest and soil--would be at least as vital a purpose as job creation. 
The third objective of the CCC, whose significance has perhaps become even more apparent as years have passed, was generally envisioned by FDR in his 1933 message to Congress:  
More important, however, than material gains, will be the moral and spiritual value of such work. We can take a vast army of the unemployed out into healthful surroundings. We can eliminate to some extent at least the threat that enforced idleness brings to spiritual and moral stability. 
In other words, in a nearly inadvertent way, the CCC had the effect of not only rebuilding roads, trees and dams, but also of rebuilding men. While the challenges our country faces today are vastly different than those of 1933, and the makeup of our corps of volunteers has become much more diverse than the young `CCC boys,' the spirit of national service remains strong. 
For example, the work of the more than 40,000 citizens now serving as part of the Corporation for National Service's AmeriCorps program is powerful proof that national service is as important now as it was for my father's generation. 
A group of Georgians who recognize FDR's legacy of hope, opportunity and spirit of service are working to erect a statue honoring the Civilian Conservation Corps in Warm Springs, GA. How appropriate such a recognition would be. Roosevelt's CCC is an important piece of our nation's and our state's history, and something that should serve as an example for generations to come.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important legislation which will remove a significant tax filing burden currently imposed on employers of domestic workers. 
In 1994, Congress adopted legislation reforming the imposition of Social Security and Medicare taxes on domestic employees. These new rules introduced more rationality into the tax system, and relieved reporting requirements of domestic employers. 
Unfortunately, the legislation did not go as far as needed. By not fully reforming the federal unemployment tax (FUTA), Congress left in place a significant burden on domestic employers which previously existed. Today I urge you to consider my legislation which would amend FUTA as well by removing the burden of filing quarterly state employment tax returns for employers of domestic workers. 
The Social Security Domestic Employment Reform Act of 1994, Public Law 103-387, changed the Social Security and Medicare tax rules. The new law provides that domestic employers (employing maids, gardeners, babysitters, and the like) no longer owe these taxes for any domestic employee who earned less than $1,000 per year from the employer. 
In addition, the Act aimed to ease reporting requirements. Under the act, domestic employers need no longer file quarterly returns regarding Social Security and Medicare taxes nor the annual FUTA return. Rather, all federal reporting is now consolidated on an annual Schedule H filed at the same time as the employer's personal income tax return. 
Nevertheless, the goal of the 1994 act--to substantially reduce reporting requirements for domestic employers--has not been fully accomplished for employers who endeavor to comply with all aspects of the law. Under FUTA, employers must make quarterly reports and payments to state unemployment agencies, then pay an additional sum of federal tax (now once a year, as part of schedule H). In addition, The Social Security Act continues to require that employers report wages quarterly to the states regarding all employees. In other words, despite the 1994 act, a domestic employer who abides by the law must still keep track of all domestic employees, and must still fill out forms and send tax payments on a quarterly basis to his or her state employment agency. 
Congress was not unaware of the relationship of FUTA to Social Security taxes at the time it passed the 1994 act. Besides eliminating the separate FUTA return for domestic employers, the act also added a provision which permits the Secretary of the Treasury to enter agreements with States to permit the federal government to collect unemployment taxes on behalf of the States, along with all other domestic employee taxes, once a year. That statute, if used, would eliminate the need for domestic employers to report to state unemployment agencies. However, to date no state has entered such an agreement. Undoubtedly, that is because the Social Security Act continues to require quarterly reports anyway. 
The primary justification cited for the quarterly reporting requirement is that it makes information more accessible to state agencies that investigate unemployment claims. However the burden of this provision far outweighs its benefit. The number of household employer tax filings is relatively small. Representatives from the Georgia Department of Labor and their counterparts in other states are confident that the investigation of unemployment claims will not be hindered by annual rather than quarterly reporting requirements. 
I suppose one could argue that the change this legislation proposes is unnecessary, since few people even bother to comply with the FUTA requirements for domestic employees. I believe that avoiding a change for that reason is an insult to citizens who endeavor to comply with all tax laws. For example, one Pennsylvania resident paid a 12 year old girl $4 per hour during one quarter for her babysitting services. This resident was then required by law to record, then pay eight cents in tax on her behalf. Needless to say, this is ridiculous. The young babysitter would never claim unemployment compensation.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, this amendment would permit SBA to use up to $15 million of existing disaster funds to establish a pilot program to provide small businesses with low-interest, long-term disaster loans to finance preventive measures before a disaster hits. 
I just got back from Georgia where we had an incredible tornado that came through and killed 14 Georgians. It is obvious to me we need to prevent people from becoming disaster victims, especially small business people. We cannot prevent disasters, but we can prevent, in many ways, disaster victims. 
In response to the problem of the increasing costs and personal devastation caused by disasters, the administration has launched an approach to emergency management that moves away from the current reliance on response and recovery to one that emphasizes preparedness and prevention. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has established its Project Impact Program to assist disaster-prone communities in developing strategies to avoid the crippling effects of natural disasters. 
This amendment supports this approach by allowing the SBA to begin a pilot program that would be limited to small businesses within those communities that will be eligible to receive disaster loans after a disaster has been declared. 
Currently, SBA disaster loans may only be used to repair or replace existing protective devices that are destroyed or damaged by a disaster. This pilot program would allow funds to also be used to install new mitigation devices that will prevent future damage. 
New legislation is necessary to authorize the SBA to establish this pilot program. I believe that my legislation would address two areas of need for small businesses--reducing the costs of recovery from a disaster and reducing the costs of future disasters. 
Furthermore, by cutting those future costs, it presents an excellent investment for taxpayers by decreasing the Federal and State funding required to meet future disaster relief costs. The ability of the small business to borrow money through the Disaster Loan Program to help them make their facility disaster resistant could mean the difference as to whether that small business owner is able to reopen or forced to go out of business altogether after a disaster hits. 
I urge my colleagues to support this effort to facilitate disaster prevention measures so that when nature strikes in the future, the costs in terms of property and lives, and taxpayer dollars, will be reduced. However, in the interest of time, and with a commitment by the chairman of the Small Business Committee, the distinguished Senator from Missouri, to have our committee expeditiously consider this proposal, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and commend the Stetson Model Senate program and the nearly one hundred college students who participated in this year's three-day session. Students from Stetson University, Goucher College, University of Central Florida, Clemson University, Lake Sumter Community College, Jacksonville University, The Citadel, and Longwood College conducted committee meetings, party caucuses, and sessions of the full Senate, portraying Senators of the 105th Congress. 
This year's program marked my second year attending and speaking at the Model Senate's annual dinner. I was very impressed both with the level of student awareness of public affairs, and with the number of students and schools which participate every year. 
I congratulate Stetson University, my alma mater, for encouraging these college students to learn more about this nation's political processes and history. 
Mr. President, I would like to especially honor and commend Dr. T. Wayne Bailey, professor of Political Science at Stetson University and organizer of the proceedings, and Kevin Kayes, Senate Parliamentarian, who guided the students during the sessions of the mock Senate. I truly enjoyed meeting these young men and women participating in the 1998 Stetson Model Senate and ask my colleagues to join me in saluting and congratulating these college students and the organizers of this inspirational program.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, just a short time ago, the Senate was prepared to consider, and likely to adopt, a resolution granting the President largely unlimited authority `to take all necessary and appropriate actions' to respond to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs. After some of us raised concerns about the echoes of Tonkin Gulf in that original wording, we were then prepared to endorse a measure which constrained that authority by requiring that it be `in consultation with Congress and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws.' 
Some of us were prepared to stand behind this language, and its endorsement of the President's policy determinations which we generally believed would culminate in air strikes by American forces against Iraq, though no one, including the President, believed that such strikes would necessarily accomplish our principle objective of removing Saddam Hussein's arsenal of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. 
We then were presented with a diplomatic solution of the crisis negotiated by U.N. Secretary-General Annan that offered the prospect of achieving our principle goal in a way which strikes from the air could not possibly have done. It empowered UN inspectors on the ground in Iraq to more fully investigate and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The President has, in my view, taken the correct approach. He welcomes the agreement as representing a solution to the current problem, while immediately seeking to test and verify Iraqi compliance. He reserves our ability to take such other action as may be necessary if the agreement proves inadequate. Let me say clearly that this outcome is a good deal for the United States, the people of Iraq, the entire region and for international security. It is especially a good deal for the thousands of American families who have loved ones on guard right now for us in the Persian Gulf. 
There is no more awesome responsibility facing us as members of the United States Senate than the decision to authorize the use of American military power. Such action puts America's finest, its servicemen and women, in harm's way. This basic fact was driven home to me as I reviewed the following press reports from my home state of Georgia over the past few weeks: 
From the February 12 Valdosta Daily Times: 
Troops from south Georgia's Moody Air Force Base departed for the Persian Gulf today. Up to 3,000 soldiers from Ft. Stewart are expected to follow soon. About 80 Air Force rescue personnel from the base near Valdosta departed just after 7 AM along with two HC-130s, which refuel rescue helicopters, drop para-rescue jumpers to assist in operations and deploy equipment for rescue operations. . . 
From the February 12 Augusta Chronicle: 
As tensions mount in Iraq, some Fort Gordon troops are preparing for possible deployment in the Middle East, and the 513th Military Intelligence Brigade is poised to provide intelligence support for military operations there. . . 
From the February 13 Macon Telegraph: 
Base workers loaded a C-5 cargo plane with communications equipment Thursday afternoon as 30 members of the 5th Combat Communications Group prepared to fly to the Persian Gulf area about 6 a.m. today. The communications group, commonly known as the 5th MOB, primarily is responsible for establishing communications and air-traffic-control systems for military operations. . . 
From the February 18 Savannah Morning News: 
3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized) soldiers like Spc. Shane Rollins of the 3rd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, had little time to relax as they prepared for a deployment to the Middle East. In less than a week, Rollins and nearly 3,000 other Fort Stewart soldiers will be in Kuwait. 
And from the February 22 Columbus Ledger-Enquirer: 
As about 200 Fort Benning troops left Saturday for a possible confrontation with Iraq, Acting Army Secretary Robert Walker said the decision to send more troops from the post hinges on what Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein does next. 
Such scenes have been repeated all over America in recent weeks, and underscore the human consequences of our policy deliberations in this chamber. Before discussing those important questions with which this body must grapple in fulfilling its Constitutional role, we must always be mindful of the young men and women who will risk more than their reputations in carrying out the policies we approve.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to call my colleagues' attention to an article which appeared in the Washington Post on January 27, 1998 entitled `Web Venture Links Lobbies, Legislation.' The article discusses INCONGRESS (www.incongress.com), an exciting new Web site that promises to open up our legislative process and make it possible for our constituents to have access to the same documents that we receive from lobbyists. 
INCONGRESS enables interest groups that lobby the Congress to put their policy statements and press releases--on issues and legislation before the Congress--on one single Web site in an organized and targeted manner. This information is maintained in the INCONGRESS data base so that it can be retrieved at any time by our staffs or any other user of the site, including our constituents. 
Personal subscriptions to INCONGRESS are free for Members of Congress and their staffs, as well as for all other government employees, the media and members of the general public. The INCONGRESS Web site is supported entirely by the private sector lobbyists who pay an annual fee to transmit their data from personal computers in their offices right into the site. 
INCONGRESS enables all of us, both here in Washington as well as our constituents back home, to see the position papers of lobbyists and interest groups at the same time. The information is retrievable seven days a week, 24 hours a day to any subscriber. This is a major step toward our goal of making the legislative process a more open and informed one. 
My reasons for calling this matter to the attention of my colleagues are twofold. First, INCONGRESS promises to make a great contribution in our access to information and differing viewpoints of pending legislation. It will enable all of us to see the same information at the same time--assuming the interest groups use it, and as the article mentions, several of them have apparently already begun to do so. 
Secondly, I am proud to point out to my colleagues something which the Washington Post article did not mention. The INCONGRESS Web site was designed and constructed in my home state of Georgia by IBM Interactive Media in Atlanta. As many of you know, IBM is quickly emerging as the leader in electronic business--or e-business as some refer to it--and I am proud that the men and women at IBM Interactive Media in Atlanta are playing such a major role in this effort. 
In addition, I want to observe that two great Georgia companies, AFLAC, Inc. of Columbus and Bell South of Atlanta, were among the first companies to sign up as INCONGRESS Advocates and agree to put their public policy positions on this Web site for all to see. I commend both of these fine companies for being good corporate citizens and for setting an example which I hope all interest groups--including corporations, trade associations, and unions--will soon follow.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to take a minute to address a Senate action which took place yesterday on March 11, 1998, specifically the passage of my amendment number 1977 to the bill S.1173 which involves the addition of Elbert and Hart Counties, Georgia to the Appalachian Regional Commission. 
First, I would like to thank my distinguished colleagues, the Chairman Senator Chaffee and Ranking Member Senator Baucus for their superb leadership on this bill as well as Senators Warner and Byrd for their input and guidance to insure that my efforts on behalf of Elbert and Hart Counties in Georgia were able to come to fruition. I also wish to commend Georgia Governor Zell Miller for his role in bringing this matter to my attention. 
As you know, my amendment will allow Elbert and Hart counties to gain membership in the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). I am extremely proud to be able to help the fine Georgians who reside in Elbert and Hart Counties to join the region served by the ARC. Back when the Appalachian Regional Commission was established in 1965, these two counties were geographically eligible to be included, but the local leadership at the time declined to do so. 
Well, here we are, over 30 years later, and the people of Elbert and Hart Counties have been given what we all need in life, `a second chance.' The economic and educational assistance provided by the valuable programs of the Appalachian Regional Commission will be extremely valuable for the fourty-thousand or so people who reside in Elbert and Hart Counties in their efforts to better their economies and their communities. 
I, along with those Georgians of Elbert and Hart Counties, would like to thank my Senate colleagues for their wisdom and generosity in providing for successful passage of this amendment.

They opted out of the original act creating the Appalachia Regional Development Corridor in 1965. They now desire to enter on behalf of their counties. This amendment directs itself to two counties in Georgia that qualify in every respect and meet the standards of the law. I urge the amendment be agreed to.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Hugh Thompson, Lawrence Colburn, and Glenn Andreotta, who helped save the lives of 11 Vietnamese civilians during the My Lai massacre in Vietnam thirty years ago. Hugh Thompson and Lawrence Colburn received the Soldier's Medal for bravery on March 6, 1998 for their gallant efforts during the My Lai massacre. Their comrade Glenn Andreotta, who passed away three weeks after the My Lai massacre, was honored as well, and his family will receive his medal at a later date. The Soldier's Medal is presented by the Army to those who show `the highest standards of personal courage and ethical conduct.' 
After their helicopter landed amongst firing U.S. troops and fleeing Vietnamese civilians, Thompson, protected by Colburn and Andreotta, went to confront U.S. forces. The efforts of these three men led to the eventual cease-fire at My Lai and an end to the killing. 
Hugh Thompson and Lawrence Colburn are both natives of Georgia. Hugh Thompson, a veterans counselor, hails from Stone Mountain, Georgia, and currently resides in Lafayette, Louisiana. Lawrence Colburn, now a salesman, lives in Woodstock, Georgia. 
Mr. President, I would like to honor Hugh Thompson, Lawrence Colburn and Glenn Andreotta for their heroic efforts during the My Lai massacre, and for their outstanding commitment to American values. These three men are true examples of American patriotism at its finest.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, as we near the end of Black History Month, I wanted to take this opportunity to recognize the bravery, patriotism and service of one of Georgia's Revolutionary war heroes. Austin Dabney served in the Revolutionary War and was wounded in 1779, in the Battle of Kettle Creek, one of the most difficult and bloodiest battles fought in Georgia. Austin Dabney was a slave brought to Wilkes County, Georgia by a man named Richard Aycock. Dabney was granted freedom in order to serve in the war in his master's place, as an artilleryman in Colonel Elijah Clark's corps. 
In the Battle of Kettle Creek, Dabney was seriously wounded by a shot through his thigh. His life was saved by a white soldier named Giles Harris, who took the soldier to his home and nursed him back to health. To show his gratitude to the Harris family, Dabney worked for them for the rest of his life, living with them in Madison, Newton and Pike Counties. Dabney's devotion to the Harris family didn't stop there. Dabney used money from his own pocket to send Harris's son through college, and even made arrangements for the son's legal training. 
In 1786, the Georgia Legislature emancipated Dabney to prevent his former master from seizing him as a slave to benefit from the soldier's fame. Despite Dabney's veteran status with pension, because he was black, he was denied the opportunity to enter the land lottery for Revolutionary veterans in 1819. The Georgia legislature voted in 1821 to grant 112 acres of land for Dabney's `bravery and fortitude,' but that grant was bitterly contested with law suits. A land lot was finally granted to Dabney in 1824. 
Austin Dabney and Giles Harris both illustrate an important lesson in American History. Divided racially but brought together as soldiers, neighbors and devoted friends, they are examples of the great patriotic and democratic spirit that is the foundation our society. They are fitting examples of why it is important to learn and remember our complete American History.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I recently had the privilege of attending worship services at the Riverside Baptist Church here in Washington, D.C. I was inspired by the warmth and spirit of the congregation, but I was especially touched by the message of inter-racial understanding in the sermon by Riverside's minister, the Reverend Michael Bledsoe. 
Reverend Bledsoe's message was particularly compelling in light of the fact that Riverside Church is a church where they `practice what they preach'--a church in which all groups of people and races are represented and welcomed with open arms. 
As was stated in Reverend Bledsoe's sermon, Black History Month is a celebration of all of this nation's African American men and women and their contributions and accomplishments that have informed us, educated us, inspired us, challenged us and have made us all proud. This sermon reminded me of these men and women who have had such a profound impact on American culture.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, the year 1996 witnessed both a record high in the amount of money spent in pursuit of federal office--a staggering $1 billion, an increase of 73 percent just since 1992--and the second worst turnout in American history. In 1996, some $220 million was spent on Senate races alone--an average of $4.5 million per campaign. Members of Congress combined currently raise an average of about $1 million a day. It has been estimated that if these trends continue, by the year 2025 it will take $145 million to finance an average Senate campaign. This is truly a ridiculous situation. 
When I came to the Senate last year, I volunteered to serve on the Governmental Affairs Committee. Sitting in the Committee's hearings on campaign finance abuses and listening to the sordid tale of the 1996 money chase was a most unsettling experience. What I witnessed, heard and read made me even more convinced that we must strengthen our campaign financing laws, now, and provide strong enforcement through the Federal Election Commission of these laws, now, or risk seeing our election process be swept away in a tidal wave of money. 
At the conclusion of the Governmental Affairs hearings, I wrote to the Committee Chairman to make four basic recommendations as appropriate follow-ons to the investigation:

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, my personal friend and dear colleague, for his character and especially his courage in putting forward this resolution and in taking the leadership in making sure that this resolution is enacted. I am honored to be a cosponsor of the National Character Council Week resolution. 
Mr. President, the stories and statistics are painfully familiar; we have all heard them--children having children, young boys joining gangs out of a need to belong, children as young as 9 years old smoking marijuana or shooting up heroin or inhaling freon from the living room air conditioner just to find a high. 
Now the latest figures are in from the Department of Justice: 25,000 juveniles murdered between 1985 and 1995. Half of all high school students who carry a weapon take that weapon to school. Juvenile arrestees are now more likely, according to the Department of Justice, than adult arrestees to have used a gun in committing a crime. 
James Agee once said, `In every child who is born, under no matter what circumstances * * * the potentiality of the human race is born again.' 
Mr. President, how many times have we heard that our children are the future of our country? I believe that our highest obligation is, and our biggest challenge is, with the children of America. We can work together to help ensure that all children will start school ready to learn. We can pool our efforts--parents, teachers, community leaders, and elected officials--to enable our students to be first in the world of scientific and academic achievement. But I believe the greatest gift and most effective tool we can give to our children is to instill in them, from the beginning, the values and beliefs which mold their character. Character is the essential building block in each youngster's journey to become a responsible, moral adult. 
George Matthew Adams once said:  
There is no such thing as a `self-made' man. We are made up of thousands of others. Everyone who has ever done a kind deed for us, or spoken one word of encouragement to us, has entered into the makeup of our character, and of our thoughts, as well as our success. 
Robert Kennedy credited his father with shaping his beliefs about what the definition of true character is. He said: 
He has called on the best that was in us. There was no such thing as half-trying. Whether it was running a race or catching a football, or competing in school, we were to try. We might not be the best, and none of us were, but we were to make the best effort to be the best. 
For Ronald Reagan, it was his mother, Nelle, who was his source of inspiration. He said about his mother: 
My mother, God rest her soul, had an unshakable faith in God's goodness. And while I may not have realized it in my youth, I know now that she planted that faith very deeply in me. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. It calls on our citizens and communities to teach and promote the core elements of character: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship. 
Decades ago, during the war in Korea, one of our generals was captured by the Communists. He was taken to an isolated prison camp and told that he had but a few minutes to write a letter to his family. The implication was that he was to be executed shortly. The general's letter was brief and to the point: `Tell Bill,' he wrote, `the word is integrity.' 
The word is indeed integrity, Mr. President. As our resolution states, `the character of a nation is only as strong as the character of its individual citizens.' If this is so, Mr. President--and I hope it is and I think it will be--the future of this country will be in very good hands.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to speak today in support of the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act, better known as ISTEA. More importantly, I am here today to add my voice to that of the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, who has made an eloquent and persuasive case for bringing this legislation to the floor for consideration at the earliest possible opportunity. 
That I believe was the commitment the Senate made to the American people prior to our early adjournment last year. In the last several days, I paid close attention to that said by my colleagues, many of whom in the Senate have commented on this matter. I would like to make just a few observations. 
One of the most striking aspects of the debate which is apparently delaying the Senate's consideration of ISTEA is that it is taking place at all. It is not all that uncommon, I suppose, based on my limited time here, that we argue how to utilize supposedly dedicated trust fund moneys. I am here today to say that these trust fund dollars, whether for Social Security or transportation, are not ours to allocate as we see fit. They are collected from the American people based on specific usage, and we have been entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that in the case of transportation the taxpayers' gas tax dollars are used for our great country's critical infrastructure needs. 
Unlike the Senator from West Virginia, I am not an expert on the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, but I am a student of history, and I believe that ancient Rome was one the world's earliest and most successful civilizations. Some scholars would say it was good government that allowed the empire to survive as long as it did. 
Others believe that it was the strength of the Roman army. In my opinion, one of the most enduring legacies of the Empire, carried on in our American civilization today, is the practice of building roads to facilitate commerce and defense. America's transportation system is the envy of the world and so is the commerce it facilitates. I'll add that the Roman Empire was once the envy of the world too. Where is it now? With apologies to Gibbon, maybe their government failed to pass its transportation funding in a timely fashion. 
By delaying the reauthorization of this multibillion-dollar ISTEA funding we put at jeopardy not only commerce and defense but the very lives and livelihoods of those who send us here. Recently I was contacted by a Georgia hospital on a different matter, but it did concern a road project in Georgia. They made the case for the need for a particular transportation corridor and stressed the difficulty their emergency service vehicles were having in this area. When we put off, day after day, action on this legislation, we impede, and sometimes, stop action on projects which may be critical to an area's economy, or vital for highway safety. 
Many Senators, Democrat and Republican, North and South, East and West, have all made the case that we need to take up ISTEA legislation, and I respectfully join those colleagues in urging prompt action. We must take up this legislation now. That was the promise that was made to the American people. 
When we make commitments, Mr. President, we must stick to them. We simply cannot be a body of continuing resolutions. That is not good government and it does not serve the people well. I know the leadership has heard about this a great deal the last 2 weeks, but I must respectfully request that we take up this legislation now; let's bring this matter to the floor now. 
Mr. President, ISTEA legislation is important to our largest cities and our smallest communities alike. It's about jobs, safety, commerce, defense, and it's about the future. It's too important to put off until an uncertain future date. We have a responsibility to act now. Let us do the work required of us. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I yield any remaining time to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.

Mr. CLELAND. I thank the President, and I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding to me time to speak. 
Mr. President, I am here today to convey my enthusiastic support for the nomination of Dr. David Satcher for the positions of U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health. 
The job of Surgeon General is to serve as a defender of public health and safety and bring important health issues to the forefront of public awareness. I regret the long vacancy that has existed in the position of U.S. Surgeon General and I implore the Senate to support the nomination of Dr. David Satcher and fill this long vacated seat as expeditiously as possible. 
Dr. Satcher's background reflects a strong emphasis on preventive medicine and an intense care for our nation's youth and underserved communities. His expertise covers a wide range of medical fields, and I believe Dr. Satcher will certainly be a strong voice for public health and medical education. 
For the past four years, Dr. Satcher has directed the world renowned Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency located in my home state of Georgia, which has 11 major branches and worldwide responsibility. While at the CDC Dr. Satcher has championed stepped-up immunization drives, spearheading initiatives that have increased childhood immunization rates from 55% in 1992 to 78% in 1996 while simultaneously reducing vaccine-preventable disease to the lowest rates in U.S. history. In addition, Dr. Satcher has boosted programs to screen for cancer, upgraded the nation's capability to respond to emerging infectious diseases and laid the groundwork for a new Early Warning System to detect and prevent food-borne illnesses. 
Throughout his career Dr. Satcher has worked in patient care, health care policy development and planning, education, research, health professions education, and family medicine. He is a physician, scholar and a public health leader of national stature and has received broad support from the medical community. In 1986, Dr. Satcher was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences in recognition of his leadership skills. In 1996, he received the prestigious Dr. Nathan B. Davis Award from the American Medical Association for outstanding service to advance the public health. Dr. Satcher has also received the American College of Physicians' James D. Bruce Memorial Award for distinguished contributions in preventive medicine, the New York Academy of Medicine's John Stearns Award for Lifetime Achievement in Medicine, and the National Conference of Christians and Jews' Human Relations Award. These are awards given by Dr. Satcher's colleagues, experts in the fields of medicine and health, who have decided among themselves to praise Dr. Satcher and acknowledge his outstanding service and significant contributions to the health field. 
As Americans we look toward the Supreme Court justices as a strong national voice for the cause of justice. We look toward our priests, rabbis and ministers for spiritual guidance. The people of this great nation deserve a strong and respected voice on the issue of health, an issue that affects every single American without exception. 
I believe that Dr. David Satcher's strong background in public health matters, his dedication and unquestionable commitment to the practice of medicine, and his strong and sensible opinions on health issues make him the ideal choice for the positions of Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health. Dr. Satcher will be a strong and forceful voice of the highest quality whom every American can look to with respect and admiration. 
I ask of my colleagues, what attributes could we possibly look for in a Surgeon General that Dr. Satcher does not possess? He has dedicated himself to bettering the human condition and has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of people throughout this country and the world. Through his work, Dr. Satcher has touched millions of people, and has made their lives better. We would be doing every American a great disservice by denying the nation Dr. Satcher's service as Surgeon General. To quote an editorial from the Atlanta Constitution, Dr. Satcher `is the right man at the right time for these two positions, and the Senate, which must confirm him, should recognize that.' 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. CLELAND. 
Mr. President, today we are introducing legislation which would authorize presentation of a Congressional Gold Medal to Len `Roy Rogers' Slye and Octavia `Dale Evans' Smith. `Heroes are made every little while,' Will Rogers once said, `but only one in a million conduct themselves afterwards so that it makes us proud that we honored them at the time.' The gold medal we propose would honor two American heroes for the wholesome entertainment they have given the world for six decades and for the shining example they have set as role models for America's youth. I am pleased to be joined by the distinguished cosponsors, Senators Coverdell, Helms, and Glenn. 
For generations of Americans, Roy Rogers has been the symbol of the Western hero--a man who combines courage with honesty and impeccable integrity--who always righted wrong through straight talk and square-dealing. When asked about the roles he played on-screen, Roy once answered that he did `what I was supposed to do. I played myself. * * * When I talk about my image, there isn't anything that isn't really me. I always try to be the best that I can be.' In all that we have seen or heard or read about Roy Rogers, on screen or off, the persona and the man are indeed one and the same--and in Roy Rogers we see what is best about America. 
Dale Evans counts among her highest honors the Cardinal Terrence Cook Humanities Award and the California Mother of the Year. Both are tributes to two of her greatest gifts--her generosity of spirit and her strong family values. Together she and Roy have raised nine children, and they have sixteen grandchildren and 30 great-grandchildren. And the fact that most of them live near Roy and Dale's ranch outside of Victorville, California, is a testament to their devotion and strong family ties. Dale is the author of 25 books. Her most famous, `Angel Unaware', chronicles the life and death of Dale and Roy's daughter, Robin, who died from complications of Down's syndrome. The book is about loss, but it is also about the capacity to love--a quality which both Dale and Roy have in abundant measure. 
Roy and Dale are an American institution--and their fans span the globe. Together they have achieved the pinnacle of success in the entertainment industry. Their movies were No. 1 at the box office. Their television series was the highest rated of its time. The episodes have been translated into every major language, and they can still be seen here in America and in markets abroad. Between the two of them they have set appearance records in every major arena in the world, including Madison Square Garden, the Los Angeles Coliseum, the Chicago Stadium, the Harringay Arena in London, and Toronto's Canadian National Exhibition. Roy once sold out Madison Square Garden 29 straight nights, and he still holds the record for the largest crowd ever to see an indoor rodeo. 
It has been said that we make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give. Both Roy and Dale's careers have been an unqualified success, as their world-wide appeal attests. But this tells only half the story. Their appeal--which reaches to all four corners of the globe--is also the result of the values, the ethics, and the uncompromising principles by which they have lived their lives. It is our hope that we honor their worthy contributions with the Congressional Gold Medal. Should we do so, we will have honored in their time true American heroes, and our choice--to use Will Rogers' yardstick--will be validated by the ages to come.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the distinguished Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. I applaud his stalwart leadership on this important matter. 
Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of a Constitutional amendment to prohibit the physical desecration of the United States flag. 
Like many Americans, I was troubled when the Supreme Court ruled in two cases, Texas v. Johnson, and United States v. Eichman, that statutes protecting the United States flag were unconstitutional violations of the First Amendment right to free speech. I respected the wisdom of the Justices of the Supreme Court, yet I was saddened that we no longer were able to rely upon statutory authority to protect the flag. 
I was especially saddened in light of the views expressed by such distinguished past and present Supreme Court Justices as Justices Harlan, Warren, Fortas, Black, White, Rehnquist, Blackmun, Stevens, and O'Connor. These Justices have each supported the view that nothing in the Constitution prohibits the states or the federal government from protecting the flag. Nonetheless, the current Supreme Court view stands. That is what brings us here today. 
The flag is not a mere symbol. It is not just a symbol of America. It IS America. It is what we stand for. It is what we believe in. It is sacred. 
I do not have to tell the Senate what the flag means. 
Just ask the soldier who proudly marches behind the flag what it means to salute the flag of the United States. 
Ask the newly sworn citizen what it means to claim the flag of the United States for his or her own. 
Ask the grieving widow or mother of a slain soldier who is presented with the flag that draped the soldier's casket. 
Being from the South and being a history major in college, it was only natural that I become a student of the Civil War. For those who do not believe in the flag, I would point to the literally hundreds of citations given to men in battle during the Civil War for acts of valor associated with the flag. 
Soldiers were routinely awarded the Medal of Honor, America's highest military award, for defending the United States flag and carrying it forward into battle. Many of these awards were awarded posthumously. These brave men knew the meaning of the flag. 
The flag unites Americans as no symbol can. Only God and the United States Constitution itself stand above the flag. 
Everywhere history has been made in this country, the flag has been present. 
It was the United States flag that inspired our National Anthem. 
It was an American flag that was raised when Jesse Owens stunned Nazi Germany. 
It was a United States flag that was hoisted in Iwo Jima. 
It was the United States flag that was planted on the Moon. 
Those who would desecrate the flag would desecrate America. I cannot stand by that. Therefore, I stand for a Constitutional amendment. 
This amendment is simple. It vests only Congress with the authority to protect the flag through statute. We need not fear that the states will create a hodge-podge of flag protection statutes. Instead, Congress can create one uniform statute for the entire nation. 
According to opinion surveys, 3 out of every 4 Americans support protecting the flag from desecration. Forty-nine states have enacted resolutions to calling on Congress to pass a flag protection amendment. I believe we ought to let the American people decide this important matter. Therefore, I lend my support to efforts to send this initiative to the American people for ratification. 
Unfortunately, it has been the Senate that has blocked these efforts. The House has twice passed resolutions that would begin the formal process of amending the Constitution to protect the flag. The Senate has failed to respond to the overwhelming majority view of the American people. 
I believe now is an especially important time to reinforce our support for the American flag. The United States is unquestionably the world's only remaining superpower. Our leadership around the world is unrivaled. The principles of democracy and freedom that guided our forefathers in establishing our great nation are seen as shining examples for the world. 
Everywhere that communism has failed, where dictators have been overthrown, where tyranny has been rooted out, people look to America. And it is an American flag that leads our ambassadors, our troops, our citizens, and our hope as we lend our support and leadership to those nations struggling to overcome their past. 
People who seek asylum from religious, political, and ethnic persecution look for an American flag flying over our embassies abroad to guide them to the place where their human rights will be respected and protected. 
Let us now send a strong signal to the world that we truly cherish this great symbol. Let us now use this opportunity to show the world that we reaffirm our commitment to the ideals the flag stands for. 
Indeed, as Supreme Court Justice Stevens said in his dissent from Texas v. Johnson: 
The freedom and ideals of liberty, equality, and tolerance that the flag symbolizes and embodies have motivated our nation's leaders, soldiers, and activists to pledge their lives, liberty, and their honor in defense of their country. Because our history has demonstrated that these values and ideals are worth fighting for, the flag which uniquely symbolizes their power is itself worthy of protection from physical desecration. 
These are powerful, wise words. Words we should all heed. 
Let us now stand in support of the Flag of the United States of America. I urge my colleagues to join with us in support of this resolution.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr President, I rise today to honor Herschel Creasman, who after more than four decades of dedicated service to spreading the gospel to various organizations and in performing community services retired on Sunday, January 18, 1998. He is an outstanding example to his family and friends, and has been an asset to the many communities that he has touched over the years including Coral Springs, Florida, where he currently resides; Athens, Tennessee where he was born; and numerous others across the South and abroad. 
Herschel chose to follow in his father's footsteps by becoming a minister. He first graduated from Carson Newman College and then went on to the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, which marked the onset of more than 45 years of faithful leadership in Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia, Florida and even five years in Brazil. Herschel has preached in more than 20 countries and has served as an instructor at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. He fostered an environment within his churches that welcomed many new faces, from differing religions and communities, who come to hear his wonderfully inspiring sermons. 
Many would think that with this busy schedule and his devotion to his wife Joanne, their two daughters and one son, and four grandchildren, Herschel would not have time for much more, but this is definitely not the case with this extraordinary individual. Over the years he has received several honorary doctorates, including a Doctorate of Theology and Doctorate of Philosophy from the Great Commission Seminary in Kentucky and a Doctorate of Divinity from Freedom Seminary in Jacksonville, Florida. He has also represented his community by serving on the Ethics Board and Community Relations Committee for the Coral Springs Medical Center and on the District Review Board for the North Broward Hospital District. 
As many people who know him well are aware, he is an avid golfer, and as he enters this next stage in his life, I wish him the best of luck on the greens, which I'm sure he'll finally have the time to truly enjoy and perhaps master! 
Mr. President, I would like to honor and commend Herschel Creasman for his outstanding and innumerable contributions over the years to the many communities and churches that he has dedicated his life to inspiring and improving, and ask my colleagues to join me in saluting and congratulating Herschel Creasman on his retirement.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a very, dear friend of mine, Mort Silberman. He has recently been elected into the National Academies of Practitioners as a Distinguished Practitioner for his contributions to the cattle industry and laboratory animal medicine. It is one of the greatest professional honors, and I am delighted that he was awarded in such a way. 
Mort's achievements are endless. In the academic field, Mort currently serves as an adjunct professor at several universities including the University of Georgia and Auburn University. He is the assistant director and the university veterinarian of the Robert W. Woodfuff Health Sciences Center at Emory University. He is also consulting veterinarian at the New York Zoological Park, and the White Oak Plantation in Yulee, Florida. 
For over 20 years, Mort has hosted a variety of seminars, lectures and workshops. He is the author of numerous published medical writings. In addition, he has been directly involved with the design and construction of many animal facilities in Georgia and elsewhere in the country--from the animal facilities of the Atlanta Humane Society to the clinical space and animal holding areas at Georgia's Stone Mountain Park. 
Mort Silberman is not only a leader in the veterinary field, but also an active community member and dedicated husband and father. Mr. President, I ask that you and all of my colleagues join in paying tribute to my dear friend. Mort Solberman, for his recent honor.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of my favorite heroes, Clayton Moore, better known to most as the Long Ranger. Clayton Moore, the world's most popular masked man, has inspired and entertained millions of Americans during the span of his career. 
Before assuming the role of the Lone Ranger, Clayton began his performing career as a trapeze artist. Unsatisfied with this career choice he moved to Los Angeles to fulfill his dream of becoming a cowboy actor. This year marks the 65th anniversary of the first time the Lone Ranger rode into our homes over our airwaves. `The Lone Ranger' was created for radio in 1933, and in 1949 Clayton was chosen to be the first Lone Ranger for the new television series which began airing that year. He continued to be the man behind the mask through 1952 and then again in 1954, until the series ended in 1957. Over the years, Clayton has appeared in over 45 films and 10 major serials. He also starred in two feature films, `The Lone Ranger' and `The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold,' and is the author of `I Was That Masked Man,' his autobiography which was published in 1996. 
The 169 television episodes showed faithful fans that characters and plots in the world of the Lone Ranger were simple--good guys vs. bad guys. We all eagerly watched as the exclaimed the four simple words of `Hi Yo Silver, Away,' and role off into the sunset with Tonto, his faithful Indian companion. In every thought, word and deed, the Lone Ranger provided a practical guide to living in a difficult and challenging world. He embodied a code that has served as a standard of moral development--combining honesty, fairness, caring, respect, loyalty, tolerance, duty, and moral courage. 
Born on September 14, 1914, in Chicago, IL, Clayton has lived a fine and exciting life, filled with adventure, glamour, danger and hard work. He was an athlete, a trapeze artist with the Flying Behrs Trapeze Act at the 1934 Chicago Worlds Fair, a model while living in Chicago and New York, and a soldier in the Air Force during World War II. 
In whatever venture he has pursued, Clayton has served as a wonderful and positive example to us all. He has entertained us throughout his acting career, has exemplified courage and patriotism as he fought for this Nation during World War II, and has been a wonderful husband to his wife, Clarita, and father to his daughter, Dawn. It is with great admiration and respect that I congratulate and applaud this fellow veteran, Clayton Moore, on an outstanding career and prosperous life. I thank Clayton for teaching us that the good guys do win.

Mr. CLELAND. I thank the chairman very much. 
Mr. President, I would also like to commend the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, for being our leader on national defense issues, and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin. They have made a great team. In terms of great teams, I think one of the greatest captains of a team I have ever come across is Senator Kempthorne, our distinguished Senator from Idaho. He and I have worked together on personnel matters and personnel issues. 
Mr. President, it is my pleasure to support the defense authorization bill for several reasons. 
One of the reasons is, as the Senator from Idaho has indicated, as my colleagues have read in the newspapers, the Air Force and Navy are experiencing real difficulties encouraging experienced pilots to stay in the service. Our Nation has invested, in some cases, up to some $6 million apiece to train these pilots, and the airlines are now benefiting from that. They are hiring scores of pilots away from the military services every month. 
As part of our effort to retain these highly skilled pilots, the pending bill increases the pilot bonus from the current $12,000 to $25,000, which is paid out over a 5-year 
period of time. This is a modest increase. It comes from existing Air Force and Navy funds and was requested by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the Chief of Naval Operations. 
Without the legislative authority to increase the aviation officer retention bonus, we will fail to give the services the tools they need to keep highly skilled pilots in the cockpit.

Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator very much. 
Mr. President, without the legislative authorization to increase military pay approved in this bill, the pay raise would be limited to 2.3 percent at the same time you have Federal workers who receive a pay raise of at least 2.8 percent. In other words, without the enactment of this bill, we will give civilians working for the Federal Government a larger pay increase, larger pay raise than we give to men and women who are out there risking their lives to defend the interests of this country. 
Mr. President, I once ran a wonderful agency, the Veterans' Administration, and I think our employees, our civilian employees, do a wonderful job. But this Defense authorization bill will allow us to give the full 2.8 percent increase that certainly our military people richly deserve.

Mr. CLELAND. The Senator is eminently correct. Without the bill, the services will be prohibited from actually reducing personnel, which is called for in the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the services will be forced to add personnel that they have actually determined, Mr. President, they can live without. We do have an era of tight resources, and I think it is unwise of us as a Congress to force the services to keep people they cannot afford.

Mr. CLELAND. The Senator is absolutely right. The bill, in light of the criminal behavior uncovered at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland, responds to strong sentiments in the Congress. Some of those strong sentiments would like to legislate the end of gender-integrated training. 
There are equally strong voices against that type of legislation. During our Personnel Subcommittee hearings on this particular issue, the point was raised that a commission created by the Department of Defense might raise credibility issues in some quarters. 
Responding to such legitimate concerns, the Senate Armed Services Committee adopted the Kempthorne-Byrd amendment to create a congressional commission to report directly to the Congress on this very important issue. 
Mr. President, here again the Senate conferees had to fight in conference to ensure that the commission remained objective.

Mr. CLELAND. This is one of the issues that I personally have a strong commitment to and that is improving the quality of care in our military facilities for our military active duty and retired personnel. 
The conference report authorizes active duty personnel serving in remote locations to receive health care through the Tricare system at no expense to that military person or that military family. It will allow military personnel and their families to receive quality health care where they live. This provision has real implications for active duty personnel and their families. It represents another quality of life improvement contained in the defense authorization conference report.

The Persian Gulf illness question is one that continues to baffle those of us who try to deal and struggle with it, but it certainly baffles the members of the military family that served in the Persian Gulf. Those personnel deserve justice. They deserve treatment when they are ill and they certainly want us to get to the bottom of this question. This is one of the most serious issues facing active duty and retired military personnel, especially those who served in the Persian Gulf. 
I want to say on behalf of our committee and our great leader, Senator Kempthorne, that we take this challenge seriously, and this defense authorization bill will certainly help.

Mr. CLELAND. Let me say I appreciate Senator Kempthorne's remarks regarding the Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who were belatedly recognized. Recognition on this issue is much appreciated for those who have gone above and beyond the call of duty in the services of this country. 
Mr. President, in terms of going above and beyond the call of duty that is exactly what the distinguished chairman of this Personnel Subcommittee from the great State of Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, has done in regard to bringing me on board as a freshman Senator in making me feel welcome, keeping me posted and informed, and including me in all of the legislative hearings and in all legislative debates and all legislative matters before our committee. It has made me feel very much welcome and very much a part of things. This was my first year on the committee and I couldn't have been more fortunate to have gotten a better chairman than Senator Dirk Kempthorne. I understand he intends to return to the great State of Idaho after completing his term in the Senate. He will be missed as a dear friend, as a colleague, and as a great leader. He has one more year to serve and I look forward to working with him next year to make it a very productive year for us both. 
I also extend my gratitude to the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senators Thurmond and Levin welcomed me as a brother and a colleague into the committee, following in the footsteps of Senator Russell and Nunn in this Senate seat. It has been fun to try to tackle the chores that we tackled this year. It wouldn't have been possible without the help that I received from both of them. 
I also thank both the majority and minority staff of the committee under the leadership of Les Brownlee and David Lyles. They have all been of great assistance to me as I have served on the committee. I certainly appreciate the courtesies and hospitalities that their staffs have given me. 
Mr. President, this is a very important bill for all of the reasons Senator Kempthorne and I have discussed. It sets forth the priorities for our national defense in the next year. The very title of the bill suggests its importance--National Defense Authorization Act. It has taken 9 long months to get to where we are today, yet one issue remains controversial. In spite of numerous concessions made by the Depot Caucus, this bill faces the threat of a veto. I do not understand this. Much has been said on this topic so I will be brief. 
There are at least two significant concessions. First, we agree to the Department of Defense request to continue free and open public-private competitions for the workloads at Kelly Air Force Base, TX, and McClellan in California, rather than directing the departments to transfer this workload to the main depot which we believe is the intent of BRAC. To those who do not believe this is a major concession, this would ratify the mechanism that overrides the BRAC recommendation. 
I yield to the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it has taken 9 long months to get to where we are today. Yet one issue remains controversial. In spite of numerous profound concessions made by the Depot Caucus, this bill faces the threat of a veto. I do not understand this. Much has been said on this topic, so I will be very brief. 
There were at least two significant concessions. 
First, we agreed to the Department of Defense request to continue free and open public-private competitions for the workloads at Kelly Air Force Base, TX, and McClellan Air Force Base, CA, rather than directing the Department to transfer this workload to the remaining depots, which we believe was the intent of the BRAC. I would urge those who do not believe this is a major concession to consider that this measure would essentially ratify a mechanism that overides a major BRAC recommendation. 
Second, we agreed to the Department of Defense request to lower the 60-40 rule to 50-50. The administration requested 50-50. The Congress responded with 50-50, over the objection of many in the Depot Caucus. 
What I find ironic is that on the two most significant priorities the administration had, we conceded to the administration position. Yet there is still talk of a veto here. I do not understand that, especially when I have to explain to people why we agreed to give up so much in return for so little. 
I am not completely satisfied with the depot provision in the conference report, but it is a provision I can live with. The Department of Defense shares this view, and I would note that the provision has the unanimous support of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
The provision does not include everything that either side really wanted, but it is undoubtedly a fair and unbiased bill that places bidders on an equal footing. 
When Robins Air Force Base won the contract to perform maintenance on the C-5, it had to go the extra mile to prove to the Air Force that it could do the job. It had to endure additional audits, above what is normally expected in such cases. Robins' bid was adjusted after it was submitted to account for factors which the private bidder was not subjected to. In spite of this unlevel playing field, Robins was able to win the award because of its outstanding record and the quality of its people. 
I support fair competition, and I agree it can result in lower costs to the Federal Government. This bill provides for fair competition. I urge my colleagues to adopt it, and I urge the President to sign it into law.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I recently had the privilege of attending a reunion of Carter administration officials in Atlanta. In an interview he gave to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, President Carter, whose personal integrity has never been questioned, summed up the current state of affairs very candidly, and all too well. The President's comments, which appeared in the October 19, 1997 edition of the Journal-Constitution, were as follows: 
The intense competition now almost forces Democrats and Republicans to cut corners on basic principles of politics in order to raise enormous amounts of soft money. I think it's an embarrassment to our nation. It's a travesty of proper political life. And I think it debilitates democracy itself in our country. As (Vice President Mondale) and I have agreed, it's a form of legal bribery. People can raise hundreds of thousands of dollars and contribute that money to candidates in both parties. They don't do this from a sense of altruism or benevolence or generosity. They do it in expectation of access to leaders, to present their point of view personally to someone in the Senate or someone in the White House when the people who might suffer from that sort of decision don't have an equal opportunity to present their point of view. So it distorts the whole political system and I hope it will be changed. 
At that same Atlanta gathering, former Vice President Mondale paraphrased Abraham Lincoln to the effect that, `With public trust, everything is possible. Without public trust, nothing is possible.' He added, compellingly: `Public trust cannot be bought. It must be earned.' 
Indeed, this is an indictment of our political system from individuals who have reached the pinnacle of success in that system. I believe the single most important step we can take in this Congress in rebuilding public confidence and faith in our democracy is to enact, on a bipartisan basis, meaningful campaign finance reform to clean up a system which has gotten completely out of control and which undermines both the operation and reputation of our entire national government. I think President Carter and Vice President Mondale would certainly agree, and I commend their observations to my colleagues.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleagues today in search of any rhyme or reason behind the veto of the $6.8 million project that the President vetoed at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia. It is known as the HH-60 OPS/pararescue project. It is a critical project that supports combat search and rescue training and pararescue training operations. This project should have been included in the budget. It benefits the quality of life for our service members, and has been operating at Moody since April, 1997. There is no apparent rationale for this veto action. I believe that the Moody project was vetoed because it failed to meet all the criteria for approval set by the administration. Thus, the claim was made that: first, the Moody project was not requested in the President's 1998 budget; second, the project would not improve the quality of life of military service members and their families; three, the project almost certainly would not begin construction in 1998. 
Responsible consideration of veto targets would have taken into account and weighed all the facts. The facts are these. My information is based on the fact that, in 1996, the Pentagon announced its plans to move two squadrons, the 41st and 71st, from Patrick Air Force Base, FL, to Moody Air Force Base, GA. In connection with the move, the Air Force began quartering a small number of people at Moody as early as October 1996 and subsequently moved the squadrons there in April 1997. The relocation is now complete and the unit is operating out of a temporary trailer. 
Having made a formal announcement, the Pentagon certainly had a genuine interest in the success of this project. The Air Force, having begun the transition in October 1996, obviously intended to implement the plan. Unfortunately, the decisions came too late for the Pentagon to include this project in the President's fiscal year 1998 budget, though, again, I believe there can be no doubt that our defense leadership fully supports the new mission for Moody. 
My distinguished colleagues, let us not forget that this Congress is duly responsible for ensuring that our legislation considers appropriate measures where the administration's submission may actually be lacking. It is not unusual, Mr. President, but in fact very common, that in the course of congressional review, we make additions or deletions that are in the best interest of national defense. 
In my opinion, this is one of the most critical projects that I have come across. I sit on the Armed Services Committee. I think it is my job, not only as a Senator from Georgia but as a U.S. Senator to bring up other concerns that the administration does not raise. I would like to say that the Moody squadron does employ the Blackhawk helicopter to implement its mission, and the project supports essential combat search and rescue training and pararescue training operations. What could be more important to the quality of life of military service members and their families than facilities that can operate to preserve those lives? 
Apparently, the administration erred in assuming that the squadrons had not yet located to Moody. Actually, the move began in 1996 and is now complete. I think if this veto is not overridden, the mission capability of the squadron will be seriously impacted. A combined function facility is required to provide both an adequate squadron operations space and pararescue space. No facility currently exists at Moody to support the HH-60 pararescue squadron. Without this facility, new mission functions will be almost impossible to perform and may not be able to operate as designed. Whether the veto was arbitrary or ill-advised, the bottom line is that the Moody veto makes no sense.

Mr. CLELAND. Senator Coverdell and I are both supporters of the line-item veto to reduce wasteful spending. But the basis for the veto, as the Senator from Arizona indicated, must be prescribed and must rely on the facts, not on false assumptions. Clearly, in the case of the Moody facility, the facts did not justify the decision, and the project did not warrant a veto. 
Mr. President, this project has been and remains a top priority for Moody Air Force Base and for both Georgia Senators. The mission has been and remains in place at this time. I look to this bill to make right the wrong of the veto. In so doing, I hope to be able to support the needs of the additional 680 military personnel and approximately 1,500 spouses and dependent children that the mission has brought with it to Moody. 
I yield to my colleague, the senior Senator from Georgia, for his remarks. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Georgia who spoke eloquently on this matter. It is clear that the people are already there, and the need exists for this operation facility. There was a misunderstanding, a miscommunication, about this matter at the Executive level, and that we were not properly consulted. Otherwise, we would have been able to share vital information with them at the time, and it might have changed the outcome. 
But I hope, along with my distinguished colleague, Senator Coverdell from Georgia, that the Senate will override the President on this matter and make sure that this vital operational facility is present at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia to accommodate some 2,000 personnel that are already in place, as the Senator has so accurately indicated.

Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I certainly understand the position of the Senators from Texas and California. They have worked long and hard on this issue. I understand where they are coming from. I congratulate the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, and others, who have worked just as hard to make sure this is a fair bill. The bill is consistent with the targets of the bipartisan budget agreement. 
On the major issues such as Bosnia, the B-2 bomber, and cooperative threat reduction, the bill is much closer to the Senate position than the House position. The most difficult issue to resolve in the conference was the depot maintenance provision. These provisions are the product of intense communication, diligent coordination and diplomatic negotiations of the issues to the fullest extent possible. We have actually been working on these issues some 9 months. We made numerous significant concessions in order to reach an agreement. 
In the final analysis, the major concessions were: 
We agreed to the Department of Defense request to continue free and open public-private competitions for the workloads at Kelly Air Force Base, TX, and McClellan Air Force Base, CA, with public-private partnerships. 
We agreed to the Department of Defense request to lower the 60-40 rule to 50-50. 
We agreed to the Department of Defense request to solicit a single contract for multiple workloads having been certified by the Secretary of Defense. 
And we agreed that it is critical to maintain a core capability at the public facilities with a surge capacity that supports our mobilization needs at a moment's notice. 
In spite of all the concessions made in this agreement, the opposition believes this should be an all-or-nothing deal. To do so, I think, would truly negate the rules of fairness and the competitive market, and it undermines the credibility of DOD's stated financial priorities. It also risks the future of legitimate privatization efforts by the Department of Defense. 
I am satisfied with the depot provision in the conference report. The Department of Defense is satisfied with the provision. And the provision has the unanimous support of the Senate Armed Services Committee on which I serve. 
The provision does not include everything that either side really wanted, but it is undoubtedly a fair and unbiased bill that places bidders on an equal footing. 
I find it hard to argue against fairness. So, Madam President, I suggest this body finally act on the defense authorization bill, and it has my support. Thank you very much. I yield the floor.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a dear friend of mine, Patrick Curtis, who is being honored next week with the 100th star on The Palm Springs Walk of Stars in Palm Springs, CA. 
Patrick first set off on the road to stardom when he played Baby Beau Wilkes in Gone with the Wind. As a young actor working his way through film school, he worked on dozens of westerns, the Ma and Pa Kettle comedies, nearly every Tony Curtis film made in the 1950's, and even on the Leave it to Beaver set. 
Upon graduating from film school, Patrick received a naval ROTC commission. He later served his country in Vietnam in 1967 and 1968. 
Patrick has risen to become a highly successful film director and producer. He has had the opportunity to work with many legends and personal heroes of mine. Recently, he produced Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch, a documentary western about John Wayne, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Hoppy, and other six-gun legends. 
Even with his busy film schedule, Patrick has found time to give back to his community. He was asked by President Ronald Reagan to serve as president of the Vietnam Veterans Leadership Program, an organization of successful veterans with the purpose of helping veterans who have not been able to mainstream. For his continued support of Vietnam veterans, Patrick has been awarded the prestigious Air Force Association Humanitarian Award. He has also been presented lifetime membership in The Marine Corps League, The Navy League, and The Air Force League. 
In addition to his work with veterans, Patrick has worked to gather together talent in the entertainment industry to create public service announcements for groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving, DARE, and Activities for Retarded Children--all paid for by funds raised from the entertainment industry. 
Mr. President, I would like to honor Patrick Curtis for his outstanding and numerous contributions to the entertainment industry, to America's veterans, and to his community. Patrick's selfless service to his country and community are a great example of what it means to be a great, patriotic American.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join my colleagues in recognizing September 15 through October 15 as Hispanic Heritage Month. It is important that we reflect on the great contributions that Hispanic-Americans have made to our Nation. 
Hispanic-Americans embrace the American society and culture, while at the same time perpetuating a unique cultural heritage of their own. In so doing, they are contributing to our Nation's diversity--a quality Americans take great and justifiable pride in maintaining. 
As one of the fastest growing segments of our society, Hispanic-Americans are an increasingly vital part of our economy. Hispanic-owned firms contribute significantly to our economic growth, and their ranks are increasing every day. In my own State of Georgia, which once served as the boundary between Spanish and English America, the number of Hispanic-owned businesses has risen 184.9 percent over the past 10 years. 
But the contributions of Hispanic-Americans go well beyond the economic arena. Their strong commitment to family, community, and country sets an example for all our people. For example, many have demonstrated their commitment to our Nation through dedicated military service. And Hispanic culture continues to enrich American art, music, and literature. 
Hispanic Heritage Month seeks to increase national awareness and understanding of and respect for Hispanics and their tradition of achievement in this country. Across the Nation, events are taking place which demonstrate our rich Hispanic heritage. Through these festivities, every American will be given the chance to experience Hispanic culture. I urge every citizen to do so. You will be educating yourself and giving the Hispanic-American community in your area the recognition it deserves.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I enjoyed the remarks of my colleague from the great State of Oklahoma. 
Mr. President, this is a day I have been waiting for since I had the great honor and privilege of taking my oath of office as a U.S. Senator back in January: a day when we are debating pending campaign finance reform legislation on the Senate floor. It has been a long and tortuous road since January, and on more than one occasion, we have all heard pronouncements that campaign finance reform was dead for this session, if not for all time. 
That we are here today is a great tribute to the perseverence an effectiveness of my friends and colleagues, Senators McCain and Feingold, as well as the relentless commitment of the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, to the cause of campaign finance reform. 
I wish also to thank the distinguished majority leader for affording us the opportunity to debate, and cast meaningful votes, on this vital issue. 
This is also a testimony to the groundswell of public opinion that is compelling us to act on a very embarrassing matter, the way we raise political money. 
Will Rogers said it best: `It takes a lot of money now days to even get beat with.' That was said over 70 years ago. It is certainly even more true today. 
But, in describing the current unremitting, unforgiving money chase which has overtaken our democratic process, especially, at the Federal level, in such a manner as to have a `for sale sign' on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, I like the quote by W.C. Fields to the extent, `We must take the bull by the tail and face the situation.' 
As we begin this Senate debate on whether or not we should enact far-reaching restrictions on the current way money is raised and spent for Federal office in America, we must face the situation that this current system is fatally flawed. It has enough loopholes in it to drive a fleet of 18 wheelers through it and is rendering our democratic process and our Government, which flows from that process, vulnerable to influence peddling, the inordinate impact of special interest pressure groups, foreign influence and outright corruption. 
It's time to take the bull by the tail. 
I for one have been fighting this battle for campaign financing reform for many years. 
In 1974, in the wake of the Watergate scandal, I introduced legislation in the Georgia Senate when I was a State senator limiting campaign expenditures and contributions. As Georgia's secretary of state in the 1980's and early 1990's, I fought for tighter limits on campaign giving, and full disclosure of lobbying expenditures. 
As a U.S. Senator sworn in this year on January 7, the first legislation I signed as a cosponsor was the McCain-Feingold 
campaign financing reform bill. I am 1 of 45 of my Democratic colleagues and 4 of my Republican colleagues pledged to support the McCain-Feingold bill in its present form when it comes to the floor of the Senate. 
Also, as a new Member of the Senate, I volunteered for service on the Governmental Affairs Committee, which has been conducting a far-reaching investigation into the multitude of alleged illegal and improper activities associated with the 1996 campaign. Just last week, the committee turned to consideration of suggested remedies for such abuses. All year long, I have listened to numerous witnesses, sifted through countless pages of testimony, read scores of media reports, and otherwise immersed myself in the nitty-gritty of the financing of Federal campaigns last year. I also had the personal experience of enduring the current process in my own race for the U.S. Senate in 1996. 
Sitting in these hearings and seeing the sordid tale of the money chase in 1996, has turned my stomach. I also think the American public has viewed all this with increasing disgust. What I have witnessed, heard, and read has made me even more convinced than ever that we must strengthen our campaign financing laws, now, and provide strong enforcement through the Federal Election Commission of these laws, or risk seeing our elections process, which is supposed to be conducted between the candidates, the press, and the voters, be swept away in a tidal wave of big bucks. Unless we act now, we will only see the power of special interest groups, corporations, and unions to pedal influence grow. We will only see our system more and more vulnerable to foreign governments and unscrupulous individuals. Unless we tighten our laws, we will see our system more and more operating against the public interest. 
I don't think our Founding Fathers, especially Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, had that in mind when they helped create this Government. 
Mr. President, the other day I was over in the Library of Congress and received a marvelous book by James Madison, titled `The Search for Nationhood.' Mr. President, I am afraid that more and more candidates for Federal office are not so much in search of fulfilling our search for nationhood as they are for fulfilling the search for money. 
I certainly don't think they had that in mind when they led the effort to create the U.S. Senate. Jefferson and Madison led the way to create the Senate to look at the long view of American government, and provide a balanced approach for the future of our country. 
Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence stated in that magnificent document that the Founding Fathers had pledged their lives, fortunes and sacred honor. They didn't say that in order to set up a democratic form of government that one had to spend their lives to pursue a fortune to run for public office and jeopardize their honor in the process. 
Opponents of McCain-Feingold tend to concentrate their spoken criticisms on its alleged violations of free speech. Those criticisms mistakenly equate money with speech. It is an equation which inevitably leads to the conclusion that the paid speech of the millionaire will have greater weight and influence than the opinions and expressions of the common man and woman. 
Certainly there can be little doubt about the commitment of James Madison, Father of the Constitution, an architect of the Bill of Rights, and President of the United States, to the great cause of free speech. But listen to what Madison wrote in The Federalist Papers:  
But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. 
While he was certainly both a revolutionary and a visionary, Madison never allowed himself to stray too far from the practical realities of the world in which he lived. To him, the lack of human perfection was thus the basis for government, and a factor which must be taken into account in providing a government with sufficient powers to accomplish its necessary functions, while at the same time holding it fully accountable to the governed. We must hold those who run for Federal elective office fully accountable to tight regulations and complete disclosure in the raising and spending of campaign dollars. 
Last week on the Senate floor, Senator Thompson delivered a very fine statement on campaign finance reform and free speech in which he pointed out that, in the real world, this current debate about campaign finance reform and free speech is not one of absolutes, as some would have it. This is not a choice between a system of unfettered free speech and government regulation, for our current system recognizes many, many instances in which there is a legitimate, and constitutional, public interest in regulating speech, from slander laws, to prohibitions on the disclosure of the identities of American intelligence agents, to the campaign arena itself, with a longstanding ban on corporate contributions, and quarter-century and older limits on other forms of contributions and disclosure requirements. 
So the debate really isn't about free speech. TV isn't free, yet it's the main vehicle by which Federal candidates connect to their voters, and the single most important factor driving up campaign costs. In the words of Dr. Norm Ornstein, a noted political scientist and recent witness in the Governmental Affairs hearing, the question is not free speech, but whether we will erect some fences to prevent the worst abuses of campaign financing to occur. I'm for tighter fences, to prevent the horse from getting out of the barn next time. 
Campaign finance reform opponents also sometimes claim to be concerned that such efforts will further increase the advantage currently enjoyed by incumbents. Even on its face, I have a hard time taking this argument seriously. I am aware of very, very few cases in the real world of contemporary American politics, whether at the Federal, State, or local level, where incumbents do not enjoy a substantial advantage over challengers under the current system. And, it is difficult to imagine any situation under which any form of campaign limits, whether or contributions or spending, will not constrain far more the incumbents rather than the challengers. 
For example, earlier this year, the group Public Citizen presented one of the first detailed analyses of the 
likely impact of the expenditure limits contained in the original version of McCain-Feingold, based not on theoretical conjecture, but on the actual results had S. 25 been in effect in the most recent elections for each of the 100 U.S. Senate seats, based on the 1992, 1994, and 1996 Senate elections. The findings of the Public Citizen study clearly demonstrate that had the provisions of McCain-Feingold been in effect since 1992, Senate campaign spending would have been reduced by $259 million--that's $259 million--with far more of this reduction coming among incumbents than challengers. While fully 90 percent of all the Senate incumbents were able to exceed McCain-Feingold's spending limits, just 24 percent of all the challengers did so. In other words, 9 out of 10 Senate incumbents would have been forced to spend less by McCain-Feingold, while only one in four challengers would have seen their spending constrained. This should put to rest any legitimate argument that spending limits are an incumbent's protection measure. The record does not bear this out, and as the figures demonstrate, this is not even a close call. 
Some also charge that McCain-Feingold, in whatever version, would somehow advantage Democrats more than Republicans. First of all, one of the prime sponsors of S. 25 is my good friend and fellow Vietnam veteran, the distinguished senior Senator from Arizona. Senator McCain is many things. He is a wonderful human being, and a fine Senator. But, he is also a very faithful Republican. He would never put forward a proposal which would harm is party. 
Once again, the Public Citizen report bears out this commonsense wisdom. 
Since 1992, almost identical portions of Democratic and Republican Senate candidates would have exceeded McCain-Feingold spending limits: 54 percent of Democrats, 59 percent of Republicans. You can't get much more of a level playing field than that. 
And, while the revised version of McCain-Feingold does not contain spending limits, the principles of greater constraint on incumbents than challengers, and of relatively even partisan impact, applies to soft money and issue advocacy advertising as well. 
As I have told anyone who has asked, I like being a U.S. Senator. Having the privilege of representing my State in this body, where such giants as Clay, Webster, Calhoun, Norris, LaFollette, Dirksen, and Russell have served with distinction is the greatest honor of my life. But, sitting here day by day, with evidence continually mounting in the Governmental Affairs Committee hearings of campaign abuses, and public opinion surveys chronicling the loss of public trust in the political process, not to mention the ongoing massive fundraising which takes place all the time in the Nation's Capital, I cannot but conclude that the current campaign finance system is broken and cries out for reform. 
We have heard a lot of talk, and we will hear more talk this week and next, about these abuses, and about the general topic of campaign finance reform. But, the time is coming when we must take action. Certainly, the revised McCain-Feingold package is not perfect; it is not all that I think needs to be done to remedy our problem, but it is an essential first step aimed at dealing with the worst of these abuses which currently plague our campaign system. 
The revised bipartisan campaign finance reform proposal does not contain spending limits, does not contain limits on PAC's, and does not provide free or discounted broadcast air time for Federal candidates, all of which I personally favor. It places no limits on what groups or organizations say in their campaign-related communications. 
What the proposal does do is this: It bans soft money contributions to and spending by the national political parties--something that has been the bane of those that care about campaign finance reform, and who have witnessed the testimony before the Government Affairs Committee. It should be noted that the pursuit of soft money is at the root of almost all of the questionable fundraising activities identified to date by the Governmental Affairs Committee 
upon which I sit. 
I might say also that if you ban soft money then all contributions, whether you are a union member, a citizen, stockholder, would be voluntary because you would have only two ways you could contribute: Independently on your own, or through a political action committee registered with the Federal Elections Commission. That is voluntarily as well. 
The bill modifies the definition of `express advocacy.' These are ads, unfortunately, that don't provide a clear distinction between communications used to advocate issues from those used to back or oppose candidates. This bill would require that clear distinction. 
Under the proposal, independent groups will be free to air either kind of ad, but to qualify for the `issue ad' designation and thereby to avoid the disclosure and financing requirements applied to candidates and party committees, they merely have to not use a candidate's name or else run more than 60 days before the election. This hardly represents an infringement on free speech. 
It improves the enforcement of existing laws by expanding disclosure and Federal Election Commission monitoring capability. It strengthens current law in such areas as fundraising from Federal property, and the use of the Congressional franking privilege. 
It strictly codifies the Beck decision concerning the right of nonunion members to have a refund of any union fees used for political purposes to which they object. 
It bars political parties from making coordinated expenditures on behalf of candidates who do not agree to limit their own personal spending on their own behalf. 
It bans all campaign contributions and expenditures by foreign sources. 
In addition to this core package, Senators McCain and Feingold will offer an amendment, which I strongly support, to establish a voluntary system in which those candidates who raise a majority of their contributions in their home State, accept no more than 25 percent of total contributions from political action committees, and spend no more than $50,000 of their own money in the election would receive a 50-percent discount on television costs. 
We must have controls--rigid, well-enforced controls--on campaign financing because campaigns are the embryo of democratic government itself. Men are not angels, yet we must find ways to govern ourselves in a fair and democratic manner. Therefore, we must enact laws to control the financing of campaigns for Federal office in a fair and democratic manner. 
My colleagues, the country is watching what we do on campaign finance reform. Make no mistake about this. They are understandably skeptical that we will take action to reform the system under which we all were elected. Their expectations for our action are quite low. Let's surprise the public as well as ourselves. Let's prove that physicians can heal themselves. Let's take the bull by the tail. 
I urge my colleagues to support the distinguished efforts of two courageous Senators, John McCain and Russell Feingold, who through their diligence, persistence, and strong belief in upholding the finest traditions of our democratic process have brought us to this hour. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.  
Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute to my good friend Wally Amos. `Famous Amos' known to many Americans as the founder of Famous Amos Cookies and the father of the gourmet chocolate chip cookie industry, is an example to all of us. He is an example because of his dedication to our country as a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, and for what he has accomplished as an entrepreneur and businessman. He is a citizen of this country who has reaped great success but has not neglected his responsibilities to the community. And even more than that, Mr. President, Wally Amos brings a powerful and inspirational message to people in all walks of life. 
I have said over and over that I believe that small businesses and entrepreneurship are the foundation of the economic engine of this country. Wally Amos has for some time now written a monthly column subtitled `Grow Your Business,' and I would like to take just a few moments to highlight several principals that he has offered as a result of good and bad experiences he has lived though: First, effort doesn't always equal results. You grow a business by assessing your personal strengths and contributing them to the efforts of the team. Second, some of the greatest personal growth comes as a result of some of the most challenging experiences. What you give attention to grows. Rather than give attention to what you don't have, focus on what you do have. Third, fear creates anger, resentment, anxiety, frustration, and worry, none of which will help you succeed in business. Fourth, be passionate about your business. Demonstrate that you care for your employees and business associates. People are your most important asset. Fifth, your employees have a vested interest in your success. Sixth, dogmatic behavior and stubbornness have created long-term success. The quickest way to failure is to believe that your way is the only way. 
Mr. President, in every job Wally Amos has had, he always started at the bottom and worked his way to the top. I hope that others will look to the example of citizenship and entrepreneurship of Wally Amos and be inspired as I am.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am proud to offer my support for the Small Business Administration reauthorization. I am extremely proud to be a part of the Small Business Committee and, I appreciate the work of my chairman and the ranking member for their hard work and for working together to resolve all of the outstanding differences on the details of the bill. I also thank so many of the staff for their hard work. 
Mr. President, there are several things I want to highlight in this legislation. First, I want to offer my strong support for the Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot Program. Many times, good men and women have come to this floor in support of programs and opportunities that aspired to do great things for those who needed it most. Some of those initiatives have gone on to become great public endeavors. I am proud to support such an endeavor, one that I believe will inspire and offer hope to Americans that truly want to break the cycle of poverty and build a business of their own. This program puts our money where our mouths are. It provides upfront technical assistance for business planning, loan application assistance, and development of sound business skills for people who we can provide a ladder of opportunity rather than just the same old welfare system. If we want to stand strong behind the notion that public assistance should be a hand up, not a hand out, we must pro-actively seek out ways to provide meaningful job opportunities for welfare recipients. This program is a step in the right direction. 
This program targets traditionally under-served Americans and gives them tools they can use to, not only take themselves off of the welfare rolls, but provide job opportunities in areas of the country that are desperate for job growth. This legislation has been tried and shown great promise. With 2.8 million Americans moving off of welfare, the potential for this program is obvious. It's the kind of investment that can return much, much more than what we put in. Let me add just a few more points. The average microloan to an individual is $10,800, not a lot of money by Washington standards, but to the man or woman who just wants an opportunity to change the direction of their life and that of their loved ones, it may make all the difference in the world. 
I also offer my support for the SBA's Small Business Technology Transfer Pilot Program. This important program builds on past successes of further advancing increased commercialization of federally funded research projects. 
Finally, Mr. President, I want to say how proud I am of the National Women's Business Council and the work that they have done. I am honored to have worked with Senator Coverdell and thank him for helping to obtain funding for this important organization and the work that they do on behalf of women. I further add that Anita Drummond on the minority staff and Suey Howe on the majority side were particularly helpful in this effort and should be commended for a job well done. 
All in all, there are many provisions in this legislation that I am proud to have had a part in crafting. I look forward to even more success on a bipartisan basis from within the committee, from the SBA and from the small business community in tackling the problems facing small businesses. I look forward to the work ahead. I thank my colleagues and I thank the chair.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, during my tenure as Administrator of the Veterans, Administration a `fall back and rescue' plan was formulated to be of assistance to those veterans with VA guaranteed mortgages which might be burdensome. 
The proposal which later became a VA regulation is now, as then, referred to as IRRRL which stands for interest rate reduction refinancing loan. 
Many thousands of eligible veterans have already benefited from this legislation during the past 17 years of its existence and the VA personnel involved deserve many thanks for their dedicated interest and help. 
My concern is not with the legislation or the Department of Veterans Affairs, but rather with the seeming reluctance of many in the mortgage industry to take a more active posture with regard to its implementation. 
I have been told by those who are in the know that the numbers of interested lenders is very small in comparison to the need. 
I call upon those companies who service GI mortgage loans to be more receptive and to make known throughout the veterans community the existence of these mortgage `lifelines.' 
The main features of the IRRRL are the following: First, in most cases the interest rate will be lower, and the payment will be lower. Documentation is at a minimum and no credit evaluation is done; second, refinancing can be done if the mortgagee is less than 2 1/2 months behind in their payments; and third, the veteran can add up to $6,000.00 to the mortgage for energy efficient improvements, for example, air conditioning, heating systems, insulation, storm door and windows. 
In closing, I also encourage Secretary designate Hershel Gober to intensify the VA's efforts to communicate to veterans information on this very vital and viable tool which is available to them. Further, I hope to enlist in the same effort the extremely valuable services of my good friend, former VA Secretary Jesse Brown, whose knowledge and dedication to veterans is unquestioned.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, hearing the discussion in this Chamber today gets my juices flowing. I appreciate the comments of everyone here. It reminds me that back in my great State of Georgia there is a little town called Waycross that has adopted as its mascot a little comic strip character called Pogo. Pogo was a little possum that lived on the edge of the Okefenokee Swamp, and he was famous for one statement, which is, `We have met the enemy and he is us.' 
There is no question, Mr. President, that the enemy of campaign finance reform is us, and yet the friends of campaign finance reform are us. We have to resolve this issue. It is not going to be left up to anyone else, any one other body. We have to do it and no one else is going to do it. 
I am extremely pleased to join with my distinguished colleagues from Arizona and Wisconsin and Maine and Michigan to discuss this critical issue that I think is one of the most important issues we face certainly this year. 
Now, my friends, Senators McCain and Feingold, have indicated we will be voting on this issue in this Chamber this September. I certainly hope so. Three of us here also have the distinction, and I guess it is an honor, of serving on the Governmental Affairs Committee which is investigating a series of illegal and improper activities in connection with the Federal elections of 1996. All three of us--myself, Senator Collins, and Senator Levin--are recently veterans of the campaign finance wars, each of us having won election or reelection in the 1996 elections. I think that is one of the reasons why we have a burning desire to change the very system 
under which we ran. 
While the Governmental Affairs Committee has more work to do in uncovering the full story of the 1996 elections, it is already abundantly clear that the atrocious current system of Federal campaign finance laws has made our country vulnerable to efforts by foreign as well as domestic sources to improperly influence our electoral process. As Georgia's secretary of state and certainly as a U.S. Senator, I have been aware for a long time of the domestic abuses of big money and special interests, and that concern has helped fuel my longstanding interest in significant campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, these Governmental Affairs proceedings have been an eye-opener for me. They have indicated to me the incredible vulnerability that this country and our political system experience in terms of foreign special interests. As the preceding speakers have indicated, we as a group are not wedded to any one plan. We will be working with other Senators to come up with the best legislation we can possibly put together. But we will insist that the final legislative language we will support and force a vote on in September be truly bipartisan, must be real reform and not a sham, and in my view to constitute real reform at a minimum we must reduce the role of big money in our political process, help level the playing field for less-financed candidates and must ban soft money altogether at the Federal level. One of the unifying threads of the Governmental Affairs investigation to date has been the very concentration virtually of all the fundraising abuses in both parties in the realm of soft money. 
So I look forward to taking our case back home to our constituents in August and in forging a bipartisan compromise which does incorporate the necessary elements of real reform. We are not going to terminate our effort. We intend to terminate these abuses.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to speak today about the work the National Women's Business Council [NWBC] is doing in my State and the work they do for the country in the interest of women-owned businesses. I want to make special note of the efforts of one of Georgia's shining examples of entrepreneurship. Mr. President, Carolyn Stradley started out filling in potholes with asphalt and from that has grown a small business that is now responsible for work done in both the Olympic Stadium and the Georgia Dome. In addition to successfully competing in a male dominated business world, she is literally paving the way for other women to find opportunities into the work force through the creation of small businesses. 
Yesterday morning Carolyn moderated a workshop that provided a forum to discuss, develop, and find consensus on policy recommendations which enhance women business owners access to capital and credit at every stage of business growth. This forum was part of 10 workshops being held at Federal Reserve Banks and branches across the nation. The top 10 recommendations from each of the 10 workshops will be compiled into a report and presented to Congress and the President by the NWBC. The participants of these workshops include women business owners, bankers and other lenders, government representatives and other experts who work daily to develop financial strategies that are so essential in getting small businesses off the ground. 
Mr. President, I want to commend the NWBC for their work and their continued efforts as an independent source of advice and counsel to the Congress, the President and the Small Business Administration. Their mission is to promote bold initiatives, policies and programs designed to foster women's business enterprise as well as an economic environment conducive to business growth and development for women-owned businesses. The council has focused on four key areas: (1) expanding public and private market opportunities for women-owned businesses; (2) promoting the development of a research agenda and data collection on the women's business sector and public awareness of its contributions; (3) strengthening the networking capabilities of women entrepreneurs and the technical assistance and training infrastructure; and (4) expanding the financial resources available to women business owners and ensuring their access to them. 
I believe that it is particularly fitting that the NWBC does have this focus and I would point to a few important figures, just in Georgia alone, that would support this. Mr. President, as of 1996 there are nearly 204,000 women-owned businesses in Georgia employing over 622,000 people and generating over $87 billion in sales. During the period of time from 1987 and 1992, the National Foundation for Women Business Owners estimates that the number of women-owned firms in Georgia has increased by 112 percent, employment has grown by 334 percent and sales have risen 508 percent. In 1996, women-owned firms accounted for 36 percent of all Georgia firms, and provided employment for 34 percent of Georgia workers, and generated 24 percent of the State's business sales. Finally, I am proud to point out that Georgia ranks fifth in growth in the number of minority women-owned firms as of 1996--a 227 percent increase between 1987 and 1996. 
Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support and fund organizations like the National Women's Business Council. Small Businesses are the foundation of our Nation's economic engine and small businesses are the future continued economic growth and success.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the accomplishments of the Olympic Solidarity Program and its partnership with the Savannah International Training Center, the only recognized athletic training venue in the United States whose athletes are funded by the International Olympic Committee. This scholarship program has brought athletes from Africa and South America to Georgia, continuing the spirit of the 1996 International Olympic games by giving opportunities to athletes from developing countries. 
The Savannah International Training Center is the largest Solidarity Training Center in the world. The Solidarity Program provides athletes with funds for room and board, education, visas, transportation and training costs. In June 1996, 25 Olympic Solidarity Athletes arrived in Georgia from countries such as Zimbabwe, Rwanda, and Colombia to participate in the outstanding track and field program. The facility hopes to be able to expand its programs to include weightlifting, swimming, and soccer. Essentially, the Solidarity Program provides athletes with a unique experience like no other in the United States or in the world. 
This program not only enhances the quality of life for the athletes; the Olympic Solidarity Program has provided the community of Savannah and the State of Georgia with an international experience comparable to the 1996 Olympic games. Exposure to the variety of cultures existing among the participating countries allows the citizens of Savannah to develop stronger ties with these nations and improve foreign relationships. 
The Savannah International Training Center continues to thrive and grow, exemplifying Georgia's commitment to the success of international athletics and the spirit of the Olympics. It is with great pride that I congratulate the Savannah International Training Center, the city of Savannah, the International Olympic Committee and the athletes involved for contributing to the unparalleled success of this distinguished program in the United States and for continuing the Olympic legacy in the State of Georgia.

Mr. CLELAND. I thank the chairman. I wholeheartedly agree with my colleague from Georgia. Hartsfield is operating beyond its capacity during peak departure and arrival times. This produces excessive delays, inconveniences passengers, disrupts flight schedules, and increases operational cost for Hartsfield's carriers. 
Commuter, typically turboprop, and other prop aircraft operations compose approximately 18 percent of the airport's activity. These aircraft weigh much less than air carrier jets. During final approach, additional intrail separation must be used when a turboprop is behind an air carrier jet due to wake turbulence. This additional separation imposes delay to aircraft behind the turboprop, delaying passengers and increasing costs resulting from the downwind portion of flight. By removing the vast majority of commuter aircraft from both the downwind and final approach segments of flight, delay is reduced for both air carrier and commuter aircraft. Thus, an additional runway to handle turboprops and light commuter jets would provide many benefits to all Hartsfield carriers. 
I support priority consideration by the FAA and urge the FAA to issue an LOI for Atlanta. Would the chairman and the ranking member agree with me and the senior Senator from Georgia that this project should receive priority consideration by the FAA?

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I had planned to offer an amendment which addresses a matter that is critical to the future of America. Drug use by the nation's youth is rising at alarming levels. The Office of National Drug Control Policy's budget request included $175 million for a youth oriented media anti-drug campaign aimed at reducing drug use by our nation's children. I strongly support this campaign. 
Drug use among America's youth has doubled over the past five years, tripling among eighth graders. These trends are devastating and threaten to destroy the fabric of American society. We have an obligation to reverse these trends by motivating America's youth to reject drugs. As you know, the media exerts tremendous influence on children. Through the power of the media we are equipped to influence children via outlets that include television, radio, computer software, and the Internet. 
While drug use has been glamorized, normalized and linked with popularity, this media campaign will employ a strategy to change youth attitudes about the perceived risk of drug use and to encourage parents to talk to their children about drugs. Coupled with support from the private sector, the program would finance anti-drug messages to reach 90 percent of all children ages 9 through 17 at least four times per week. The media campaign will supplement existing public service campaigns carried out by groups such as the Partnership for a Drug Free America and the Ad Council, both of whom will participate in the Office of National Drug Policy campaign. 
Unfortunately, this program was not fully funded by the Appropriations Committee. I share its view that the funds used for this program must be carefully monitored to assure its effectiveness and non-partisan status, and I support the requirements the Committee has included that address these matters. 
However, I believe that denial of full funding sends the wrong message here. The Appropriations Committee questioned whether full funding for this new program at this time was premature. I fail to see the rationale. The numbers of children using drugs are going up. If anything, I would say that funding for such a campaign is too late, not premature. 
Let's put this funding in the context of the media. We all know that Hollywood is a multibillion dollar industry. Each year, billions of dollars are put into producing movies that glamorize drugs and alcohol. Then there is the advertising industry. I am told that the amount requested for this program is of the same magnitude of what is typically spent on one line of commercials for a fast food restaurant. And how much money every year is spent on beer commercials? If you imagine what our children are inundated with on a daily basis, and then if you think about how limited this campaign actually is, I believe one would begin to understand how much more we should be doing to prevent our children from being influenced to view drugs and alcohol in a positive light. 
My amendment would have added $65 million to help counter the messages our children receive each day. Given the expressions of opposition I have received from the Committee on this amendment, I will not offer it. Nonetheless I cannot think of a sound reason to oppose this critically important campaign. We must invest in the future of America's 68 million children. We cannot allow another generation children to be lost to the culture of drug use. 
I hope that in the future the Senate will have the opportunity to revisit this matter and increase funding for this most important anti-drug campaign.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to compliment the distinguished Senator from Nebraska on his tremendous work and the work of his staff in putting together this legislation. He and his team have worked closely with me and my staff. This legislation is a result of their efforts. 
It is my pleasure to join my distinguished colleague, Senator Hagel, in cosponsorship of this important bill to improve our veterans preference system. As the former head of the Veterans Administration myself, I certainly see the need for it. 
During World War II, America decided to pay special recognition to the men and women who have defended our freedom by serving in the armed forces. The Veterans Preference Act has been the law of the land since 1944. The premise of this law is simple. When veterans return to civilian life after serving in combat, they are given a preference if all other factors are equal when they seek to work for the Federal Government. I do not think anyone could argue with offering such a preference to the men and women of who risked their lives in service to this Nation. 
That simple premise still holds true today. While we live in a time of relative peace, the sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform who serve in or near combat are just as great. We must remain steadfast in our commitment to our veterans. 
Unfortunately, after over 50 years of operation, the preference is not working as intended. Today, many veterans do not receive the hiring preference guaranteed to them. It brings to my mind a quote from one of Wellington's troops: 
In time of war and not before, God and the soldier men adore. But in time of peace with all things righted, God is forgotten and the soldier slighted. 
We are slighting our soldiers by not honoring a commitment made to them in recognition of their sacrifice. There is compelling anecdotal evidence that leads us to believe that the current law is not working. Furthermore, the General Accounting Office has concluded through its review of the veterans preference program that in many instances, veterans are less likely than other applicants to be hired for Federal jobs. 
We believe this is wrong. We need to put more teeth in our veterans preference law. 
Our bill has seven simple parts to it. 
First, it will create an effective redress system for men and women whose veterans preference rights are violated. 
Second, it will remove artificial barriers that bar qualified veterans from competing for Federal jobs. 
Third, it will prohibit unfair personnel practices which rig the system against job protection rights of veterans. 
Fourth, it will provide enhanced opportunity for veterans to find other Federal jobs during reductions in force. 
Fifth, it will extend the veterans preference to nonpolitical jobs in the legislative and judicial branches and the White House. 
Sixth, our bill will make a violation of veterans preference laws a prohibited personnel practice, providing enhanced for disciplinary measure for those who wilfully violate the law. 
Finally, the measure extends the preference to those men and women now serving in Bosnia. 
Our bill is supported by all of the major veterans service organizations including The American Legion, AMVETS, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Retired Enlisted Association, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the Blinded American Veterans Foundation, the Blinded Veterans Association, the Disabled Veterans, the Fleet Reserve Association, the Jewish War Veterans of the USA, the Korean War Veterans Association, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the National Association for Uniformed Services, the National Military and Veterans Alliance, the Naval Reserve Association, the Noncommissioned Officers Association, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Vietnam Veterans of America. 
As a Vietnam Veteran, I look forward to working with my fellow Vietnam Veteran, Senator Hagel, on passing this critical legislation to strengthen the veterans preference program. I urge the support of my colleagues and this bill's swift passage. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I wanted to express my support for the amendment offered by the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee which would extend a chiropractic health care demonstration program currently underway by the Department of Defense. 
Congress authorized for fiscal year 1995 a demonstration program to evaluate the feasibility and desirability of furnishing chiropractic care for the military health service system. The demonstration was intended to be carried out over a 3-year period. Under the program, major military treatment facilities were permitted to contract for chiropractic health care. I would add that this follows in the wake of Congressional support for allowing chiropractors to be commissioned in the armed services. This amendment extends the demonstration program for 2 more years and would expand it to at least three additional military treatment facilities. 
I believe we should expand the range of health care options available to soldiers, not restrict them. A few years ago, the distinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle, noted on the Senate floor that the United States has traditionally kept alternative forms of medicine on the fringes of society. He went on to note that, while we must protect patients from harmful treatment, we should allow them to choose the method and practitioner they prefer, especially when evidence indicates that a group of practitioners provides high quality, cost-effective care. 
While I am not a doctor, I do believe that chiropractic health care presents an important health care option for our soldiers, especially given the types of health problems associated with the rigorous physical activity that our soldiers routinely engage in. Lower back pain is a frequent ailment that many soldiers understandably suffer from time to time. Many beneficiaries of the military health care system support the option to seek chiropractic treatment. I believe we should support that option. 
The demonstration program will allow the Department of Defense to gather the necessary information to determine the impact and desirability of chiropractic care. I believe this is an important step toward assuring that we fully meet the health care needs of our men and women in uniform. They support the option of using chiropractic care. Let's gather the necessary information in order to make an informed decision on the matter. I am pleased that the Senate has adopted this amendment.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, the Contracted Training Flight Services Program was instituted 10 years ago because the Air Force and Air National Guard determined that civilian companies could provide a high level of electronic warfare training at a much lower price than the military itself. 
The track record of this program has indeed shown that civilians can provide this training at a significantly lower price. The mathematics are clear. This program serves a vital training need: modern sophisticated, and high quality electronic countermeasures training. It is far cheaper to provide this training using cheaper-to-operate commercial jet aircraft than our military fighters. 
The Senate Armed Services Committee has a history of supporting this program and believes that it has resulted in significant savings to the Air Force and Air National Guard. I am pleased that Senator Coverdell join me in offering this amendment, and I urge its adoption.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. The United States is the leader of the free world. As the world's foremost democracy, it is our duty to take the lead in support of democratic efforts around the world. This amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should work with the U.N. Security Council and the ASEAN nations in an effort to return Cambodia to the path towards democracy that it was on. 
The First Prime Minister of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, has asked the U.N. Security Council for help. Cambodian Co-Premier Hun Sen seized power on Saturday. In light of the terrible tragedies the Cambodian people have seen over the past several decades, it would be a complete shame to allow outstanding progress toward democracy to be destroyed in one weekend of violence. 
It is very important to restore the constitutional government to Cambodia. Cambodia is scheduled to have elections in May of 1998. It is fear of the democratic process which I believe has led to this coup. Opponents of the coup have already been killed. We cannot allow democracy to fail to take root in this nation. The United States must take the lead in this matter. 
I urge, in the strongest terms, the Senate adopt this amendment. I yield the floor. 
Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, one of the reasons I sought membership on the Senate Armed Services Committee is my commitment to supporting our men and women in the Armed Forces. I am particularly pleased to be the ranking Democratic member of the Personnel Subcommittee. 
My focus on that committee has been and will be to improve the overall quality of life of our military personnel. Where possible, the level of the compensation they receive, improve military health care, and expand access to educational benefits. 
One of the areas that I am most concerned about is the availability and adequacy of military health care. In particular, I believe this Nation has incurred a fundamental responsibility to provide for the health care of military retirees. We must adhere to this commitment. 
I am especially concerned about what happens to retirees when they reach the age of 65. They are ineligible to participate in TRICARE. In addition, as the military begins to close and downsize its military treatment facilities, retirees over 65 are unable to seek and obtain treatment on a space available basis. Medicare does not currently reimburse the Department of Defense for health care services. The retirees over 65 are, in effect, being shut out of the medical facilities promised to them. 
I am reminded of the quote from one of Wellington's troops: `In time of war and not before, God and soldier men a adore. But in time of peace with all things righted, God is forgotten and the soldier slighted.' 
I know we live in an environment in which resources are constrained. We are going to have to make some tough choices between people, modernization, and procurement while maintaining readiness. We are going to have to strike a balance between these competing priorities. But we must not allow budget constraints to force us to slight our soldiers. This is morally wrong. We have a sacred responsibility to take care of those who took care of us. We have incurred a moral obligation to attempt to provide health care to military retirees who believed they were promised lifetime health care in exchange for a lifetime of military service. 
One alternative is Medicare subvention. It would appear that subvention would be fiscally beneficial to Medicare and would improve the ability of the Department to provide health care to military retirees over 65. However, I have several questions regarding possible shortcomings of subvention: 
First, does subvention meet the needs of military retirees over 65 who do not live near military treatment facilities? 
Second, as the Department continues to reduce its health care infrastructure, will maintaining access to all beneficiaries increase in difficulty? 
I understand the Department has expressed concern that, under certain circumstances, Medicare subvention could result in diminished access to military treatment facilities for other DOD health care beneficiaries. That raises my third question. Will subvention increase access to some beneficiaries at the expense of others? If so, is this what we really want? 
Another option that has been discussed is the idea of allowing retirees over 65 the option of enrolling in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program [FEHBP]. 
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the cost of enrolling Medicare-eligible military retirees in the FEHBP is between $3.7 and $4.2 billion. The primary advantage to FEHBP enrollment is the ability of beneficiaries to seek and obtain healthcare anywhere in the Nation that insurers in the FEHBP provide service. I am concerned about additional cost this program would incur especially if offered in addition to the benefits currently available to retirees over 65. My question: Is there a better way to provide similar levels of service while not adding significantly high levels of cost to the Department of Defense? 
A third option would be to allow military retirees over 65 to enroll in TRICARE. This would require additional resources to be made available to military treatment facilities to ensure that all TRICARE beneficiaries were guaranteed access. The Armed Services Committee was presented with an estimated $274 million shortfall in the budget request to fund the Military Health Service System. Frankly, without corresponding changes in the TRICARE system, continued enrollment in TRICARE will only exacerbate the current difficulties TRICARE faces in meeting all the needs of Military Health Service System beneficiaries. Under this option, we might also face the prospect of providing new access to some at the expense of those presently in the system. 
Mr. President, I know there are significant difficulties involved with choosing the optimal approach to addressing military health care concerns. We have to deal with this problem. It is one of the highest priorities listed by the men and women in the armed forces. It is also the highest priority of those who represent the retired military population in this nation. 
I believe that a comprehensive approach to reforming the DOD health care system is required. In addition to ensuring access to health care coverage, it is also necessary to ensure that health care is available to beneficiaries wherever they serve or retire. 
In 1995, the Congressional Budget Office prepared a report entitled `Restructuring Military Medical Care.' The report estimated that the total cost to the Department of Defense of providing the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program for all non-active duty beneficiaries ranged between $5.9 billion and $10.7 billion annually depending upon the percentage the Government pays for the average premium. The report also estimated the total cost of maintaining a wartime combat medicine capability for active duty personnel at $6.5 billion. Some have asked if it would be feasible to replace the bulk of the Department of Defense Health service system with FEHBP while maintaining a combat medicine capability given that the Department of Defense spends approximately $16 billion per year for health care. 
I sponsored language in the Senate Armed Services Committee report that directed the Department of Defense to conduct a study of this issue. I believe this is an important step toward gathering the necessary information we need to make an intelligent decision which honors our commitment to the personnel in the military. We need to know what impact this would have on the entire medical infrastructure in the military. I hope we can begin to find the answers that will allow us to resolve this matter. Our men and women in uniform and those who have served deserve nothing less. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues here in the Senate, especially my good friend Senator Kempthorne, who is the chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, on this most important matter. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to share with you and all of our colleagues a disturbing report released Tuesday. According to this report, produced by a panel of public and private university officials and corporate executives, the cost of a college education is rising dramatically. This figure must be contained or an increasing number of low-income students will be shut out from the opportunity to earn a degree. 
According to this report, tuition is expected to double by 2015, effectively shutting off higher education to half of those who would want to pursue it. We cannot allow this door to close on these low-income students. We should be opening these doors for our young people, not closing them. 
These rising tuition costs must be addressed. An investment in education is an investment in the future of this country. Adequate governmental support for higher education is essential in order to arm our children with the proper resources so that they are able to live and compete in a global market. I firmly believe in providing all feasible financial support for students receiving a higher education. That's why I am a cosponsor of S. 12, the Education for the 21st Century Act, which would help to increase the educational opportunities for America's youth.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a man whose name has become synonymous with gospel music, Mr. Hovie Lister. On July 19, 1997, a group of Georgians will recognize his contributions to the music field at the Civic Center in Atlanta. 
Hovie was born into music. At the age of 6, he began studying the piano and later attended the Stamps Baxter School of Music. He often accompanied his family group, the Lister Brothers Quartet, around the piano. 
His professional career began when he joined the famous Rangers Quartet and later the popular LeFevre Trio. In 1945, he came to Georgia and was the pianist for the Homeland Harmony Quartet heard over WAGA and WGST Radio in Atlanta. 
In 1948, he organized the world famous Statesmen Quartet. The Statesmen steadily rose in popularity and became the premier gospel group in the nation. Hovie, as the group's manager and pianist, soon emerged as the chief spokesman and head of the rapidly growing gospel music industry. 
Hovie was also an accomplished director and producer of radio and television shows. He became the first gospel artist to sign a national television contract and successfully directed and produced syndicated television shows for Nabisco, as well as scripted and starred in the company's commercials. 
In the early 1980's, Hovie brought together five performers who came from the top four groups in gospel music to form the Masters V. In 1982, this group won the prestigious Grammy Award and in 1986, Hovie was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. 
Mr. President, I ask that you and all our colleagues recognize Hovie Lister, not just for the contributions he has made to the music industry and my own State of Georgia, but for bringing gospel music to the attention of all Americans.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I missed some of the discussion of the Senator from Oklahoma. I would like to just highlight some points that I will mention about this discussion. 
I say to the Senator, I am a newcomer to this basic issue here, but you have been involved from the beginning of the BRAC process, all the way through. 
Was it your understanding when this process was set up to close bases, that that was exactly the intent of the entire process, to indeed close bases, and that this issue of privatization in place came along some time afterward as possibly something that was new to the process and has actually thrown that process off track? Is that your understanding?

Mr. CLELAND. I ask the Senator, is it your understanding, if this privatization in place policy stands--of course, the bill reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee does 
not prohibit privatization. It just prohibits this policy which has thrown the BRAC process off track in terms of their logistics centers.

Mr. CLELAND. I ask the Senator, isn't it true that if the action follows, that is, the privatization-in-place policy, that we have heard testimony--you and I were in the subcommittee listening to the testimony from the Air Force--that if you followed the privatization-in-place policy, rather than just sheer privatization, it begins to thwart not only the BRAC decision, but it begins to obscure the whole concept of privatizing to begin with, and that when the Air Force talks about competition, say, competing for the C-5-A workload, they put qualifications on it in order to adjust to the privatization-in-place requirement and require that work to be done for the C-5-A workload at Kelly, and that absolutely compromises, I think, the whole sense of competition between an air base, say, like in Warner Robins--it is going after that workload--and a private contractor? 
Isn't it your opinion that if we do not get rid of this privatization-in-place policy, we will end up with five air logistics centers, which is not the desire of the BRAC Commission, but three will be publicly run by the Air Force and two will be private, costing the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars? Is that not right?

Mr. CLELAND. I say to the Senator, you and I both sit on the subcommittee. That point is well-taken, that regardless of some of the aspects of this issue, which can be kind of arcane, when you start talking about air logistics centers, the bottom line is, are we going to fulfill the goal of the BRAC Commission, and that is have three air logistics centers, lean and mean and working at full capacity and ready to go in terms of the readiness of our forces? That is the bottom line. If we compromise the BRAC decision, then we will not have three air logistics centers lean and mean operating at full capacity really ready to do their job in a time of conflict and combat. That is one of the things that really concerns me about this whole issue.

Mr. CLELAND. I appreciate the Senator from Oklahoma and his leadership on this point and his concern for readiness of our forces, readiness of our air logistics centers to do the job, the ability of those centers to do the job economically and effectively, which in my reading of the BRAC process was part of the reason for the process even occurring, and that he marshaled great facts and arguments for the committee bill here, which I support, which does not eliminate privatization, it just eliminates an absurd policy that is costing the taxpayers of this country hundreds of millions of dollars and is inefficient, ineffective, and ultimately weighs down and compromises three outstanding air logistics centers. 
I just want to thank the Senator for his leadership and his scholarship on this issue. I will be supporting him on a vote. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. CLELAND. The Senator from Oklahoma is absolutely correct. I support him 100 percent on that point. And the great chairman of our committee is absolutely correct; if there is anyone who disagrees with portions of this authorization bill, offer an amendment to delete it. But to hold up the whole bill is wrong. 
Second, I am the ranking Democrat on the committee that deals with personnel in the military, particularly with quality-of-life issues. There are many things in this piece of legislation that we are about to discuss, like the 2.8 percent pay rate increase in barracks housing and housing for families on many bases and an increase in aviator pay, to recruit and retain the best pilots and service men and women. 
There are many things in this bill that our soldiers and sailors, airmen, marines, coastguardsmen out there really need. I hate to see this bill run aground on this particular point that we have been debating. 
So the Senator is absolutely correct. I support him 100 percent on that point.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the following students of Dunwoody High School in Dunwoody, GA, and their teacher for their excellent performance in the We the People . . . The Citizens and the Constitution: Deno Adkins, Leslie Alterman, Chuck Askew, Querida Brisbane, John Brown, Alice Bui, Kevin Campbell, Carrie Chu, Jeff Guggenheim, Susie Ham, Adam Hassler, Judy Hong, Michael Landis, Rachel Moore, Regan O'Boyle, Youn Park, Kim Pham, Ahmer Siddiq, David Stewart, Adam Tate, Brad Thomas, David Tran, Christin Voytko, Morhan Willis, Brent Wolkin, and teacher Celeste Boemker. I would also like to recognize the efforts of the State coordinator, Michele Collins and district coordinator, John Carr, who helped these students make it to the finals. 
This bright young group of students competed against 50 other classes from around the Nation, testing their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution and our Government. They spent hours roleplaying and testing to prepare themselves for this competition. This 3-day program simulates a congressional hearing in which students' presentations are judged on the basis of their knowledge of constitutional principles and their ability to apply them to historical and contemporary issues. 
Mr. President, it is with great pride that I offer my congratulations to these students from Dunwoody High School for their outstanding performance at the We the People competition, and wish them continuing success with their future studies.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Isador Louis Kunian, a long-time friend who passed away on March 5, 1997. Born in Atlanta, GA as Isador Louis Kunianski, he shortened his last name, but everyone who knew him called him Sonny. We are honoring Sonny not only because he was successful, but because he used the fruits of his success to help others. One of Sonny's greatest personal drives was to help people who wanted to help themselves. His participation in the education of hundreds of persons will provide a legacy to Sonny. In Sonny's own words, `Providing for a person's education is the greatest investment that I have ever made.' 
In 1980, he established the Mildred and I.L. Kunian Scholarship Fund at Georgia Tech that has helped more than a hundred students pay their college bills. In addition, he founded the Georgia Tech Satellite Literacy Program, which broadcasts, via satellite television, adult basic education classes to over 100 classrooms in rural Georgia. Sonny was instrumental in securing funding for the program from Federal, State and foundation sources. 
Sonny was a graduate of Atlanta's Boy's High School and then Georgia Tech, receiving his degree in textile engineering in 1934. Sonny played freshman football for Georgia Tech, was on the student council and was a member of several honor societies. Following college, he went to work in the textile industry until needed by the Navy from 1943 to 1945. Following this, he distinguished himself in the business world as a past president and partner with Atlanta's Kay Developers and later his own real estate development company, Kunian Enterprises. 
In civic affairs, Mr. Kunian was active and held office in a number of organizations, including the Center for Rehabilitative Technology, Inc., the Georgia Chapter of the Arthritis Foundation, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Association, the Southeastern Regional Board of the Anti-Defamation League, Families First, the American Jewish Committee, the Georgia Council on Adult Literacy, the Southern Regional Education Board and the National Jewish Welfare Board. 
Mr. President, I ask that you join me in recognizing the impact Sonny made on the world in which we live. He will be sorely missed.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise this morning, to join my good colleague from Arkansas in support of the Small Business Capital Gains Enhancement Act of 1997. 
Today, our country's economy is more robust and is growing faster than it has in the last decade and maybe even the last several decades. Fostering this growth is crucial to sustain the great and important strides that our economy has made in these past years and I believe that this legislation will go a long way to improving incentives for investment in small businesses. Cutting the capital gains tax in this targeted fashion is something that small businesses have time and again asked for because they know, as we all do, that investing in small businesses and providing capital for that investment creates growth and, more importantly, jobs. 
Small businesses have had a striking impact on Georgia's economy. They are vital as job creators, and their diversity and composition provide a work force with endless opportunities and are easily the envy of the country. 
Mr. President, according to the SBA, 97.6 percent of the business firms in Georgia are small businesses. Women-owned businesses have increased 62.7 percent since 1987. African American owned firms have increased 79.8 percent between 1987 and 1992. Hispanic firms, including part-time businesses, grew 184.9 percent in the same period of time. So the impact of this legislation is huge. These figures are numbers that corporate investors cannot--cannot--ignore, but if section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code doesn't allow them to invest in these small businesses, then I believe we are missing out on far more than the taxes that we collect as the law is now. We must make certain that these investors have every opportunity to become involved in the growing of small businesses. These are the ideal investors, they recognize that, and so should we, Mr. President. 
I wish to add support to my colleague's comments that 
across-the-board cuts, while they may sound wonderful, can in fact have a negative impact toward small businesses as they compete with big businesses for investment dollars. It is important to maintain the differences between small business and big business capital gains taxes. Making adjustment in the present law and fine tuning where needed is smarter, in my opinion, than the alternatives of wide ranging or all encompassing legislative action. 
This is an affordable tax cut and one that puts important capital dollars in the coffers of the men and women of this country who are creating jobs, creating economic opportunity, and giving hope to the country and I believe hope to our great future. I believe many of our colleagues will join us in our commitment to the small businesses of this country. I thank my friend from the wonderful State of Arkansas for his leadership and the opportunity to participate here with him this morning. This is a great opportunity that I look forward to supporting. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and any time that may remain.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to two of my heroes, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans and to congratulate them on their year-long 50th wedding anniversary celebration. Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, the world's most popular cowboy and cowgirl ever, have inspired and entertained millions of Americans during the span of their careers. 
Roy Rogers has appeared in more than 100 films since his debut in 1935, starring in most of them. During the peak of his career, from the early 1940's to the mid-1950's, he drew film audiences of about 80 million Americans per year and inspired fans around the world to organize record-size clubs. Roy moved on to other media in the 1950's, starring with his wife, Dale, in `The Roy Rogers Show' on television and in several long-running radio variety shows. 
In whatever venture they have pursued, Roy and Dale have served as wonderful, positive examples to all of us. It is with great admiration and respect that I congratulate Roy Rogers and Dale Evans on their 50th anniversary year. I thank Roy and Dale for teaching us that the good guys do win.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to UGA V, the mascot for the University of Georgia, who, this month, was honored by Sports Illustrated magazine as `America's No. 1 college mascot.' The English Bulldog carries almost 100 years of tradition as the mascot for the university's athletic program and is one of the most recognizable figures in all of college sports. The current line of bulldogs can be traced back over 50 years to when the first UGA's grandfather guarded the sidelines for the football team during the 1943 Rose Bowl in Pasadena, CA. UGA V and his forefathers have helped lead the University of Georgia to build one of the most respected and successful athletic programs in the country. The UGA line has witnessed national championships in football, baseball, and gymnastics; final fours in men's and women's basketball; and countless Southeastern Conference championships in a variety of sports. UGA IV was even invited to be the first mascot to attend the presentation of the Heisman trophy to Hershel Walker in 1982. 
I would also like to recognize the outstanding efforts and dedication of the Seiler family of Savannah, GA. Since 1956, Frank (Sonny) Seiler and his family have raised UGA and his descendants. They have also traveled across the country attending all of the University of Georgia football games. Their hard work has molded a tradition like no other in this country. 
As did the mascots before him, UGA V gives frequently of his time to charitable organizations. UGA has appeared and raised money for such groups as the Humane Society, March of Dimes, Easter Seals, and the Heart Fund. In 1984 UGA IV was named `Honorary Chairman for the Great American Smokeout' campaign on behalf of the American Cancer Society. When not appearing in his official capacity as mascot, UGA has represented the State of Georgia at a number of State functions. 
It is with great pride that I congratulate the University of Georgia for all of its academic and athletic accomplishments, and UGA, `America's No. 1 mascot.'

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the recent loss of two constituents and good friends. Mrs. Frances Chapman and Mr. Bill Kelly were more than just constituents and good friends from my home town of Lithonia, GA. They were outstanding examples to their families and friends, and assets to their community. 
Frances Chapman's accomplishments were many. She was dedicated to her community and its institutions. She was a member of the First Baptist Church of Lithonia. There she served as superintendent of the children's department, taught Sunday school and was a member of the choir. She taught for several years in the DeKalb County School System, and was a past president of the Lithonia High School Parent Teachers Association. Through her participation in community organizations she made Lithonia a place of pride in Georgia. She was a longtime member of the Lithonia Women's Club, and served twice as its president. Through her energies and activities she set an example for all of us. 
William (Bill) Kelly served his country and his community all his life. During World War II, he served in the Combat Engineers and saw action in the North Africa campaign. During his life, Mr. Kelly was always involved in one activity or another in his community. He ran a successful paving contracting company, and also helped develop the Lithonia Industrial Park. He served with great distinction for 12 years as the mayor of Lithonia, and his leadership sought to bring a better quality of life to all of its citizens. He was a longtime member of the Lithonia Presbyterian Church, Masonic Lodge No. 84 and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. He was dedicated to his wife of 55 years, Anne, and very involved with his two daughters, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. 
Mr. President, today I commend the lives and lessons of my friends, Frances Chapman and Bill Kelly, and ask my colleagues to join me in saluting their memory and accomplishments.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and commend the State of Georgia's HOPE Scholarship program. The HOPE Scholarship, which stands for helping outstanding pupils educationally, has served as a model of excellence in education for a number of other States, and indeed the entire Nation. I am honored to represent a State, which in my opinion, has one of the most innovative educational programs in the country. 
The HOPE Scholarship provides eligible students wishing to attend a Georgia Pubic College or University with tuition, mandatory fees and a $100 book allowance. The HOPE Scholarship also provides eligible students wishing to attend a Georgia Private College or University with $3000 per academic school year and an additional $1000 in Georgia Tuition Equalization Grants per academic year. To be eligible, students must be a Georgia resident, graduated from high school after a certain date and have completed high school with a `B' average. Students must continue to perform well academically and maintain a `B' average while in college to continue to receive the HOPE Scholarship. 
Students wishing to attend a Georgia Public Technical Institute are also eligible for the HOPE Scholarship. The HOPE scholarship provides tuition, mandatory fees and a $100 book allowance for students attending these technical institutions. 
Since the program began in September of 1993, more than 238,500 Georgia students have been awarded HOPE Scholarships. Because of the HOPE Scholarship college enrollment is up 1.2 percent, full-time private college enrollment is up 32 percent and technical school enrollment is up 24 percent in Georgia. At the University of Georgia, 97 percent of the entering in-state freshman were on HOPE Scholarships for the Fall 1996 quarter. At the Georgia Institute of Technology, 96 percent of in-state entering students in 1996 were on HOPE Scholarships. 
The HOPE Scholarship has given, and will continue to give, thousands of Georgia students the financial encouragement both to attend college and to persist and gain a degree. Students in Georgia know that if they work hard and do well academically, despite the rising cost of higher education, they will be provided the resources needed to further their education. Not only does the HOPE Scholarship reward those students who are willing to work hard with tuition money, but it also serves as incentive to keep Georgia's best and brightest in the great state of Georgia. 
A lack of financial resources should not prevent any American from pursuing a college education and thanks to the Georgia HOPE Scholarship, in Georgia, it doesn't. Unfortunately, however, the lack of financial resources remains the number one obstacle to higher education for many American students and their families. This is why it is so important that the necessary financial resources are provided to all students pursuing a higher education and why the importance of current education legislation, such as S. 12, that addresses this crucial need cannot be overlooked. 
I believe that federal support for education is one of the best investments our nation can make to ensure future security and prosperity. In keeping with this commitment to education I am a proud co-sponsor of S.12. The goal of S. 12 is to make higher education more accessible and affordable for all students. S. 12, `The Education for the 21st Century Act,' includes two new forms of assistance to help families meet the costs of higher education. The first form of assistance, also called the HOPE Scholarship, is a $1500 per year refundable tax credit for the first two years of post-secondary education. To qualify for the credit, students must have a `B' average and be drug-free. S. 12 also includes a tax deduction of up to $10,000 per year for qualified education expenses. 
In these days of budget cuts, we must not forget that the future of our country depends on the youth of today. If we deny our youth the necessary tools to grow and learn we deny ourselves a better tomorrow. The Georgia HOPE Scholarship is a shining example of how the people and the government can come together to create an efficient, highly successful program that benefits everyone. 
The Georgia HOPE Scholarship has been an overwhelming success and Georgians have been very fortunate to have reaped such a wealth of benefits from this innovative program. S. 12 is an attempt to provide similar opportunities for all Americans. We must work together as a nation to ensure that barriers to higher education continue to fall for all Americans. It is my sincere hope that the entire nation will follow Georgia's lead and make education a top priority. The future of our country depends on it.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight National Arson Awareness Week, a massive community based arson prevention program sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], which began Sunday, May 4, and continues through Saturday, May 10. 
This program is of particular importance to me because a city in my own State--Macon, GA--has been chosen as one of the three pilot cities. The program will focus on a week of special events aimed at educating high-risk neighborhoods on how to prevent arson and on the importance of getting community members involved. The success of this program is vital not only in Macon but in the other two pilot cities, Charlotte, NC, and Utica, NY, because they will serve as models for future American cities. 
National Arson Awareness Week was inspired by the national arson prevention initiative, which was announced by President Clinton on June 19, 1996, in response to the rash of church burnings, most of which occurred in the South. The President asked James Lee Witt, Director of FEMA, to coordinate, in partnership with the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, available Federal, State, local, and private resources for arson prevention. 
Arson is a growing national problem. One out of every four fires in this country is intentionally set. Over 500,000 arson fires occur each year, causing an estimated 750 fatalities and over $2 billion in property damage. 
These acts of violence can destroy the very base of a community, but they can be prevented. Mr. President, I ask that you and all of my colleagues recognize this week and the three cities for taking firm hold of this problem and proudly pulling their communities together to prevent future arson fires.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jackie Robinson, a true American hero. Born in Cairo, GA and raised by a single mother in Pasadena, CA, Jackie Robinson integrated major league baseball 50 years ago today. It was not an easy task. He faced outright prejudice from fans, other teams, as well as his own teammates. He was cursed and spit upon. It is hard to imagine how one man could endure such circumstances. But, he persevered and paved the way for young blacks who had long dreamed of wearing a major league baseball uniform. His courageous actions forced all Americans to face the issue of integration, and he helped to jump start the civil rights movement. 
Jackie Robinson was deservedly elected to the Hall of Fame in 1962, his first year of eligibility. He had a career batting average of .311 with the Dodgers; won the 1949 batting title with a .342; was selected as National League MVP in 1949; and named National League Rookie of the Year in 1947. 
As my dear friend, Hank Aaron, wrote in an op-ed piece which ran in the New York Times on Sunday, April 13, 1997, `Jackie showed me and my generation what we could do, he also showed us how to do it. By watching him, we knew that we would have to swallow an awful lot of pride to make it in the big leagues.' Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron not only made it in the big leagues, but they also succeeded with their lives.

Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the floor of the U.S. Senate for the first time. I do so with mixed emotions. Following in the great tradition of this seat once held by such notables as Dick Russell and Sam Nunn, I am poignantly aware that freshman Senators should be seen and not heard. However, there is an issue building in this country which I feel obligated to comment on and regarding which I can no longer remain silent. This is the issue of reforming the way we finance our political campaigns at the Federal level, particulary seats in the U.S. Congress, and especially seats in the U.S. Senate. 
There are many other issues facing our Nation to which we are all compelled to pay time and attention: issues such as eliminating the Federal deficit, taking care of those who have served this Nation in the Armed Forces, caring for our elderly and our young, improving our environment, and recommitting our educational system to excellence. However, as important as these issues are, in my opinion, they are all secondary to the basic issue before us--the need to recapture the public's faith in our democratic processes and our democratic institutions. Without that faith, all of these other endeavors will be undermined. 
Confucius, the noted Chinese sage, once wrote that there were three things that make up a great nation: First, a strong defense; second a vigorous economy; and third, the faith of people in their government. Confucius noted that a great nation might do without a strong defense, or that a great nation might be able to do without a vigorous economy, but, Confucius 
noted that a great nation could not remain great without the faith of the people in their government. 
Mr. President, I am committed to supporting programs and plans for a strong defense for our Nation. I serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee with great pride and a sense of awesome responsibility in this regard. I also am committed to a vigorous economy, and to upgrading the quality of education in America, in particular to creating hope for all of our qualified youngsters that they will have an opportunity to go to college or to receive vocational training. In furtherance of this objective, I am a cosponsor of S. 12, a program designed to provide a $1,500 tax credit and a $10,000 tax deduction to working families so they can see their children achieve the American dream. But I am especially committed to doing those things which we need to do to enhance the faith of people in this country in their own Government by cleaning up the campaign finance mess. 
When I first came to Washington as a young college student in the fall of 1963, I was inspired by President Kennedy to get involved in public service. I especially enjoyed meeting and learning from Members of the Senate. I can vividly recall personal meetings with Senators Russell and Talmadge from Georgia, and a young Senator from West Virginia named Robert C. Byrd. In those days, my heart was stirred to devote my life to politics. 
Many of us in this Chamber today got our first taste of politics in the early sixties. For me, that introduction was a positive one. 
However, when I was sworn in here on the Senate floor on January 7 of this year, I could not help but think how differently our current leaders and our current institutions are perceived by today's public, especially our young people. I do not believe that our leaders or our institutions are of lesser caliber that those of my youth, but something has obviously gone wrong. We in public office today face a hostile and cynical public, quite willing to 
take the worst possible reports about us and believe them instantly. One of the reasons for this attitude toward our public officials, I think, is the constant money chase that U.S. House and U.S. Senate campaigns have become. Additionally, when this money is spent on 30-second character assassination ads which have become the staple of American politics, can we expect our public to truly speak highly of us? 
I believe the single most important step we can take in the Congress this year in restoring public confidence and faith in our democracy is to enact meaningful campaign finance reform. This is not a problem for Democrats. This is not a problem for Republicans. It is a problem for us all. We must act together in a bipartisan manner to clean up a system which has gotten completely out of control and which undermines both the operation and reputation of our entire national Government. 
Throughout my early days in this body, I and all of my colleagues have been under a constant barrage of reports of campaign financing improprieties in the 1996 elections. I feel very strongly that our current campaign system has become a national embarrassment. 
Will Rogers said back in the 1930's that, `Politics has got so expensive that it takes lots of money to even get beat with.' How true that is, especially today. In the 1960's a Georgia politician remarked, `The only thing tainted about political money is that it 'taint mine and 'taint enough.' 
The American public isn't laughing anymore. They are demanding a change in the attitudes of politicians on the question of campaign fundraising. We currently have a political system which is drowning in money and rife with real and potential conflicts of interest. Simply stated, we have too many dollars chasing and being chased by too many politicians too much of the time. 
This unseemly money chase has taken its toll in terms of public confidence. The election year of 1996 witnessed both a record high in the amount of money spent 
in pursuit of Federal office--a staggering $800 million--and the second worst voter turnout in American history! In 1996, 10 million fewer voters went to the polls to cast their ballots in that Presidential year than went to the polls 2 years earlier. What's wrong with this picture? Some $220 million was spent on Senate races alone. In my Senate race in Georgia, I raised and spent some $3.5 million, but was outspent by a multimillionaire who spent over $10 million running for the Senate seat--$7 million of which was his own money. Is it any wonder that more and more of our citizens see that there is a for sale sign on more and more public offices in America? If we don't bring about reform of this process, limit expenditures, and establish rules for everyone to play by, the average citizen will have less and less chance to serve in this body or run for public office. Senator Daschle predicts that at the current pace of the money chase, in only 29 years the average Senate race will cost $143 million. 
This is insanity. 
We cannot allow the Congress of the United States, especially the U.S. Senate, to become a millionaires' club dominated by the rich and run by the powerful special interests. This system continues to take its toll on this body as the money chase continues. The exodus of distinguished, veteran legislators who have voluntarily departed from the U.S. Senate in the last 2 years is at an historic level. Even in my first 2 months in the Senate, I have seen noted Republican and Democratic legislators like Dan Coats, John Glenn, and Wendell Ford announce their retirement from this body partially because of the frustration of spending the next 2 years doing nothing but raising money for their upcoming campaign. Senator Ford spoke the thoughts of many when he said on his retirement:  
The job of being a U.S. Senator today has unfortunately become a job of raising money to be reelected instead of a job doing the people's business. Traveling to New York, California, Texas, or basically any State in the country, weekend after weekend for the next 2 years is what candidates must do if they hope to raise the money necessary to compete in a Senatorial election. Democracy as we know it will be lost if we continue to allow government to become one bought by the highest bidder, for the highest bidder. Candidates will simply become bit players and pawns in a campaign managed and manipulated by paid consultants and hired guns. 
The essential first step in repairing the current system is passage this year of S. 25, the bipartisan McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. I am very proud to be an original cosponsor of this proposal. It was the very first piece of legislation I attached my name to as a U.S. Senator. Briefly outlined, the bill would: ban soft money contributions to national political parties; ban contributions by political action committees to Federal candidates; establish voluntary spending limits, including limits on personal spending, and require that at least 60 percent of funds be raised from home State individuals for Senate candidates; provide candidates who abide by these spending limits with limited free and discounted television time and a discount on postage rates; require greater disclosure of independent expenditures; and prohibit contributions from those who are ineligible to vote in Federal elections, including non-American citizens. 
Mr. President, the best endorsement I can think of for this measure is that had McCain-Feingold been in effect for the 1996 elections, we would not now need to divert our attention away from the many serious problems facing our country in order to devote time and energy toward the investigation of campaign finance abuses. I serve on the Governmental Affairs Committee which will be conducting this investigation. I fully support the purposes for which this investigation is intended, but I'm saddened it has to be 
undertaken in the first place. I only hope that this effort will result in meaningful campaign finance reform this year. 
 After we pass McCain-Feingold, we will need to turn to additional reforms in order to further improve our electoral process. I am working on legislation which would strengthen the Federal Election Commission. The proposal would do several things: Alter the Commission structure to remove the possibility of partisan gridlock; eliminate current restrictions on the Commission's ability to launch criminal investigations, and to impose timely, and effective penalties against violations of campaign law; and mandate electronic filing of all reports. 
In addition, my proposal would expand the free air time provisions of McCain-Feingold in order to help level the playing field for challengers, and attack the single biggest factor in driving up campaign expenditures--expensive television costs. Finally, I am looking for methods to effectively enforce a shorter timeframe for the conduct of campaign-related activities. 
Strengthening enforcement, expanding public access to information about candidates and their ideas, and reducing the length of the campaign season will, in my judgment, build upon the solid foundation which I hope we will create when we enact S. 25. 
We have important work ahead, and often times there will be legitimate partisan, philosophical, and regional differences of opinion which should be voiced and acted upon. However, we have a shared interest, as Senators, but more importantly, as American citizens, in always acting to enhance the respect our citizens have for our great country and our democratic institutions, especially this body. 
In that spirit, and with that commitment, I urge my colleagues to join in the cause of mending our broken campaign finance system. Let us create a new campaign finance system which instills public confidence rather than undermines it, and aids the governing process rather than hinders it. 
President Grover Cleveland was right: `A public office is a public trust.' The current money chase we all engage in is severely eroding that trust. We must act to change a campaign finance system that is broken, or continue to see good men and women from all walks of life and from all political persuasions broken by it. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am delighted to have this opportunity to congratulate the University of Georgia men's and women's basketball teams on their outstanding seasons. Georgia fans all over the country have had the pleasure of watching these two teams play great basketball in a conference known for its competitiveness. Tubby Smith's Bulldogs and Andy Landers' Lady Bulldogs earned No. 3 and No. 2 regional seeds, respectively, in the NCAA Tournament, making Georgia one of only three schools in the Nation to claim two top four seeds in the tournament. 
Coach Tubby Smith, came to Georgia from the University of Tulsa in 1995. He led the 1996 Bulldogs to a 21-10 record and their first NCAA Tournament bid in 5 years. The team won their first NCAA Tournament game in 9 years and made it to the Sweet 16. This year, Coach Smith took a team with no returning starters and tied for the most wins in Georgia men's basketball's 91-year history. As a result of their 24-8 record, they received the No. 3 seed in the NCAA southeast regional. 
Coach Andy Landers has been coaching the Lady Bulldogs since 1979. During his 17 seasons at Georgia, Landers has become one of our Nation's elite women's basketball coaches. The Lady Bulldogs have appeared in 13 NCAA Tournaments, 4 NCAA final fours, and won 5 SEC titles during Coach Landers' tenure. These achievements have earned him the honors of National Coach of the Year for 3 years and SEC Coach of the Year for 3 years. The Lady Bulldogs were the SEC regular season champions and have a record of 22-5. 
The University of Georgia is fortunate to have individuals of the caliber of Tubby Smith and Andy Landers coaching their basketball teams. Not only are these fine coaches teaching their players basketball skills, but important lessons for life--courage, stamina, tenacity, and grace under pressure. Although they have enjoyed great success throughout their coaching careers, their achievements go far beyond their great talents in coaching. They have given back to their community in countless ways. Coach Landers contributes his time and energy to the United Way of Northeast Georgia, and Coach Smith is also involved in the United Way of Northeast Georgia, as well as the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association. I would be hard pressed to enumerate all of their contributions to the University of Georgia, the Athens community and to all of the athletes whose lives they have touched. 
All of the athletes and coaches of University of Georgia Bulldogs and Lady Bulldogs have displayed their skills and dedication to excellence in basketball throughout this entire season. I extend my best wishes to the Bulldogs' and Lady Bulldogs' basketball teams as they begin play in the NCAA Tournament, and to the University of Georgia Athletic Department for its continued success.

 Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today, I honor Senator Sam Nunn, my friend, and one of America's most outstanding public servants. In recognition of the exceptional service Senator Sam Nunn has given to Georgia, the Senate, and the United States, I believe it would be fitting that the new Federal building in Atlanta be designated the `Sam Nunn Federal Center.' 
Senator Nunn has provided exemplary bipartisan leadership over the past 24 years, serving in a variety of leadership positions including both chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the chairman and ranking member on the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. In his years in the U.S. Senate, Senator Nunn earned the reputation as an internationally recognized expert on economic policy, defense, and national security. 
Respected and honored by both his colleagues and constituents, it has been said of Senator Nunn, `Unlike some who gained prominence in the nation's capital, Nunn has not done so at the expense of his home base * * * Public events shift and change, but Sam Nunn keeps right on being Sam Nunn.' First elected to the Senate in 1972, Sam Nunn has been one of the most admired and respected Members of the U.S. Senate and has consistently been ranked among the most effective Senators in surveys of journalists and congressional staffers. 
Senator Nunn has recently ended his many years of service as a U.S. Senator and I am deeply honored to now occupy his seat. I believe that naming the Federal building in Atlanta after Senator Nunn would be a permanent way in which we can appropriately recognize Senator Nunn's contributions to the Nation. I urge my fellow colleagues to join me in honoring my friend, and one of America's most admired public servants, and support the passage of the bill to designate the `Sam Nunn Federal Center.' In conclusion, I would like to have Senator Byrd's September 27 floor statement made in tribute to Senator Nunn re-entered in the Record.
