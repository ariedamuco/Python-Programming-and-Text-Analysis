   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes to comment on one of our friends who is leaving the Senate. 
   We all, of course, feel strongly about the changes that take place in this  body and the people with whom we work closely, and even those with whom we do not work closely, and certainly appreciate all the things they have done while they have been here. Frankly, it is always a sad thing to have people with whom you work leave. 
   Of course, all Members have an impact in this body. All Members leave an imprint here and certainly in the areas they represent. Each of us has different ideas. That is the basis for our system. We bring those ideas here and seek to implement them, to the extent we can, by working with others to cause them to be implemented. We have disagreements, as we properly should have, and then we come to some decisions. 
   So I want to comment for a moment about my good friend ROD GRAMS who has well represented the State of Minnesota in the Senate for 6 years during the same period I have been here. He served in the House prior to that, during the same time I was there. 
   I think ROD has been one of the real good guys in terms of his dedication to doing the things he thought were best for the country, things he believed were best for the people of Minnesota. He has been a great legislator and an important friend to many of us. 
   As I mentioned, ROD GRAMS was elected to the House in 1992. He served there for one term and then was elected to the Senate in 1994. I certainly have benefited from our association ever since. ROD is a proud conservative. 
   ROD is one who is dedicated to the notion that there ought to be budget relief. He is dedicated to the notion that there ought to be Social Security reform. He is a champion of the $500-per-child tax credit and is the author of many successful tax measures. I think he has made a real contribution to the direction we have taken. 
   Above all, however, I think that idea of having a philosophy, believing in some things that are good, and working for those things, but working for them in a way where others can also work on them with you, is really the greatest contribution any of us can make. I feel sure this institution will be poorer in the future because he is not here. But he will continue to contribute to our country. 
   One of his legacies has been his determination; one of his legacies has been getting results. That is really what it is all about--to cause things to happen, to have legitimate debates and concerns about important issues. 
   I think ROD will be sorely missed in the Senate, not only as a friend but as a driven legislator who has been a critical party to this idea of less government and more personal freedoms, which is a very important thing to most everyone. 
   He will continue, of course, to make contributions to our country. Prior to coming here, he worked in the media through TV and newspapers. I suspect we will hear much more from him. 
   I will not go on further, but I simply want to say I wish ROD great luck in whatever he does. I thank him for what he has done here. I just wanted to at least briefly recognize the contributions that have been made by Senator ROD GRAMS to this institution and to this country. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will be in a period for morning business until 10:30 a.m. It is expected the House will vote this morning on a continuing resolution that funds the Government through Monday, December 11. The Senate will have a voice vote on the resolution as soon as it is received from the House. Therefore, no votes will occur during today's session of the Senate. On Monday, an additional CR will be necessary. However, it is hoped that a vote will not be needed on that resolution on Monday. I thank my colleagues for their attention.

    Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to join the Secretary of Defense in recognizing General Peter Schoomaker, a man whose lifetime of service commemorates the very spirit on which our great country was founded. General Schoomaker's distinguished military career will draw to a close on October 27, 2000, when he steps down from his position as Commander in Chief of the United States Special Operations Command. 
   General Schoomaker has always demonstrated a commitment to excellence and service. Since being commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1969, upon graduation from the University of Wyoming, his commitment to serve has provided him with the foundation of a lifetime of success. He has served at all levels in conventional and special operations and participated in numerous contingency operations, ranging from Desert One in Iran through Uphold Democracy in Haiti. He currently shoulders the responsibility for all special operations of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, both active and reserve. 
   Clearly, General Schoomaker has been a pivotal and talented player on the national security stage, but his measure as a man goes beyond the profession at which he excels. General Schoomaker's quest for excellence began early when he was a defensive lineman for the University of Wyoming football team which won the 1967 Sugar Bowl. These memories rank high on his list of notable achievements, primarily because of the teamwork it took to succeed. Fostering a spirit of teamwork continues to be the guiding force in General Schoomaker's leadership philosophy, and his enduring legacy for the service epitomizes the concepts he learned long ago on the gridiron. 
   Mr. President, the people of Wyoming have been blessed with a long list of servicemen and women who are willing to put the needs of other in front of their own. Today, I have the opportunity to celebrate an adopted son of my home state, General Peter Schoomaker, a man who embodies the qualities of determination, self-sacrifice, and leadership.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, if I could clarify, it is no big deal. What we had was the morning business time divided between Republicans and Democrats. The leader's time took some of that, so we didn't have enough. We ought to share equally what remains. Whatever that division is, it ought to be divided between the two of us.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 5 p.m. today. As a reminder, the Senate is expected to take action on the conference report to accompany the foreign operations appropriations bill as soon as it becomes available. However, votes are not expected to occur during today's session of the Senate. Votes will occur tomorrow and, as usual, Senators will be notified as those votes are scheduled. It is the leadership's intention to complete all business by the end of the week. I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I, too, am anxious that we complete the work we have before us. We still have three important appropriations bills to put together. I hope we can deal with respect to the issues and move away from some of what has happened, where we have sought, in some cases, to make an issue more than to reach a solution. 
   In fairness to the Congress and to our associates, since Labor Day there has been a substantial amount of progress made. I will review some of it to assure you that we have been doing some very helpful and useful work. 
   For example, repeal of the telephone excise tax: This was a tax that was implemented during the Spanish-American War on telephones. I suspect it had exhausted itself by this time and finally was repealed. 
   The Safe Drug Reimportation Act, which, of course, is a part of a solution to pharmaceutical costs: In the case of Canada, for example, pharmaceuticals that are exported there are under price controls by the Government and therefore are less expensive than they are in the United States. This authorizes those drugs to be reimported and hopefully to be resold at a price less than what we have had in the United States. One of the issues is to ensure that those drugs are indeed bona fide and are indeed safe and will be the kinds of drugs that we would receive absent the reimportation. 
   Permanent normal trade relations with China: An interesting issue, one that is sometimes thought to be a big gift for China. The fact is, in terms of our trade with China, the restrictions they have had against our goods have been much greater than the restrictions we have had against theirs; in agriculture, for example, a 40-percent tariff on beef. 
   If this is implemented, we will have a reduction in the barriers for us to be shipping goods to China. We have had a good deal of discussion in some campaigns about trade and whether or not the effects of trade are valuable to the United States. Of course, about 40 percent of agricultural products are sold overseas. Obviously, those markets are very important to us, but we need to ensure that it is done as fairly as can be and that we are treated well in this exchange. That, of course, is the reason for organizations such as WTO. 
   Legislation on H-1B visas was passed which allows for more high-tech people to enter this country to take jobs we are not able to fill. I think one of the very important things that goes with that is it emphasizes and funds some additional training for students in this country so that rather than hiring foreign people to fill these jobs, we will also be training people here to be hired for those jobs. I think that is terribly important. 
   We have done some things with the Children's Health Act; for instance, the Cancer Prevention Treatment Act, which is one bill that is particularly important to me. My wife is very involved in the Race For A Cure and doing things as to breast cancer. 
   The Rural Schools and Communities Health Determination Act is one that I think is very important. The real issue we have had on education in this Chamber has not been the amount of money the Federal Government spends but, rather, how it can be spent, and one of the obstacles has been that this administration has insisted that as the Federal money goes out, there are certain things tied to it that are required to be done. We on this side of the aisle have said, yes, we want to strengthen education, but we believe local educators, school boards, and State school departments should have the authority  to make those kinds of decisions. Certainly, the needs in Wyoming are different from those in New York. So we certainly needed to do that, and we have indeed done that. 
   The Violence Against Women Act was an act we passed again so that it stays in effect, which is one of the most important aspects. We have done some things with the Water Resource Development Act, which is still in play but has been passed through this Congress. It has water development projects in it, the emphasis being on the Everglades. A good deal of authorization money is made available to the Everglades, which is one of our very important ecological activities. 
   NASA authorization and DOD authorization are continued, and we have done the Interior appropriations, which took into account some of the discussion involved with the CARA Act, but it didn't make it in defined spending--not with 15 years of mandatory spending, but it did provide additional funds for activities such as stateside parks and maintenance of Federal parks. 
   It was kind of disappointing to me when we received the budget from the administration. I happen to be chairman of the Parks Subcommittee. Despite our acknowledgment of the need for infrastructure for parks, the budget provided more money for acquisition of new parks than for the maintenance of the parks we have now. So we need to make sure we deal with those issues. 
   We have had energy and water and Treasury-Postal. 
   My point is that we have done a great deal this year. Of course, there are always many more things to do. The issues 
   that probably have dominated more time than anything are the issues that most people are concerned about, such as education. We talked about education for 5 weeks here this year. I have already indicated the different view. I was disappointed, frankly, in the way that progressed. We could have resolved that long ago. But the difference in view was on who has control of the spending, and it really was held up more as an issue for this election. That is too bad. I think we have a substantial amount of that taking place. 
   Social Security: It is interesting that Social Security now becomes one of the prime issues in the election--and indeed it should be. It is something that is extremely important to most everyone, of course. The proposal out there would ensure that those receiving benefits now would continue to receive them and those close to receiving benefits would have no change. But when you take a long look at Social Security, it is clear that unless something is done over time, then young people, such as these pages, who will pay taxes in their first paycheck, probably will not be able to line up for benefits. A change must be made. 
   It is interesting that that is one of the Presidential issues talked about the most. But during the past 8 years, really nothing has been done about it by this administration. That is interesting. The options, of course, are to do nothing or to try to make changes. One of the changes could be to increase taxes. That is not a very popular proposal. Reducing benefits is equally unpopular. 
   We can take a portion of those dollars and let them be in the account of people for themselves, let them invest it in the private sector and raise the return from about 2 percent to whatever it would be in the market, which would be substantially more than 2 percent. It is too bad that hasn't been changed. We have talked about keeping all the money there, and we are determined to do that. I think we have had five or six votes on a lockbox. All of that has been turned down because it seemed to be more important at that point to make an issue rather than find a solution. 
   We have had a good deal of discussion over a Patients' Bill of Rights, of course. We have had it before a conference committee. The Presiding Officer is a leader in that, and he has worked very hard to find a solution. But really, it turns on a relatively singular issue, and that is, where do you go with your appeal? Some would like to go directly to court. Others of us would like to see in the interim a professional medical person be able to make those choices, and make them quickly, rather than the trial lawyers. So that has been a difficult issue. 
   Tax relief is something that, of course, is very important to all people. I find a lot of folks in Wyoming who are very interested in the repeal of the estate tax because we have lots of farms, ranches, and small businesses which people have spent their lives developing. The estate tax comes along and pretty well wipes out the profits they have made on efforts that have already been taxed. We passed that measure and the marriage penalty repeal. The marriage penalty clearly needed to be repealed. It provided that two people, singly, on the same salary, paid less taxes than they would if they were married. That isn't right. These, of course, were both vetoed by the President. So we didn't solve those issues. They are still there to be considered. 
   So I think in many ways we have had a very successful session. The amount of activity by the Congress is not always the measurement of success. I am one who believes there ought to be a limited role in the Federal Government and that that role is reasonably well defined, of course, in the Constitution. This is a United States of America. The implication, and I believe the better purpose, was for a limited role of the Federal Government. Obviously, there are things that are very appropriate--not only appropriate, but necessary--for the Federal Government to do. 
   On the other hand, I find as I move around in my State more and more people are saying, wait a minute, there are a lot of things here the Federal Government is involved in that it need not be involved. This economy that we have, which has been good to us over the last 12, 13 years, is a result of people being able to do things for themselves in the private sector, being able to have more of their own money to invest, using their initiative to compete. 
   So I think we ought to really examine in each of our minds what we think the role of the Federal Government ought to be and where we want to be over a period of time with respect to the division of power among the Federal Government, State governments, local governments and, most of all, of individuals. And then, as we move forward through all these programs, we ought to measure those things against that goal and see if, indeed, they are the kinds of things that contribute to the attainment of the way we see it. 
   Are there different views about that? Of course. There are people who believe the Federal Government should be involved in many things, and we have seen over the last decade sort of a turn to the Federal Government on most every issue that arises. We have found that the Federal Government is not the best place to resolve many things. 
   I don't mean to be in opposition to better government; certainly the role of defense; no one else can do that; interstate types of things we have to do; research we have to do. But there is a measure of balance that we should have. 
   I am hopeful as we complete this year and move into another cycle after this year that we can take time to really evaluate where we want to go and where we want to be when it is over. 
   I look forward to a very productive week. I, too, hope we are able to put together our packages and over the period of the next 3 days come to some conclusions. I hope we can basically try to stay within the spending limits that we have set for ourselves. The fact that we have a surplus seems to be an incentive to spend more money for whatever is there. And obviously we have to take a look at all kinds of issues. But we ought to really take a look at that surplus. Where does it belong? It seems to me that the surplus very clearly needs to be set aside. The money that goes to Social Security ought to be left in Social Security. 
   I think we have to certainly fund adequately those things that we determine are legitimate activities of the Federal Government. I think then we ought to really address ourselves to paying down the debt. I hope we will take a look at paying down the debt the way all of us take a look at home mortgages, and say we have--whatever it is--$3 trillion of publicly held debt that we want to pay off. Let's set it up to pay it off in 15 years. It takes so much every year, and that is part of budgeting. If we just say we will pay it off whenever we get a good opportunity, it never happens. I hope we can continue that effort.  
   Finally, there is, hopefully, money left from that surplus. That ought to go back to the people who paid it. We ought not to be asking taxpayers to pay in more money than really is necessary to perform the functions of government. It ought to be spent in the private sector so we can continue this fairly prosperous society. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think the focus today, as we move toward the appropriations bills, is education. It has been a focus during this whole Congress. I saw some figures that we spent a total, in the 106th Congress, of 5 weeks talking about education. That is indicative, I believe, of the importance all citizens place on education. I don't think anyone would say education isn't a very high priority for everyone. 
   The question is, How is the role of the Federal Government best created? In my view, one of the important things is to have some assistance from the Federal Government, to have some financial assistance. We also are in a system where people move about and are educated in one place and work in another place. There has to be some continuity or accountability that each of us is educated enough to be able to be successful. 
   One of the most important issues is who makes the decisions with regard to individual school systems. I think the Republicans, working on this side of the aisle, have had a very strong agenda for education, returning control to the parents for sending dollars to the classroom, dollars to States and local school boards so they can make the decisions that are necessary to be made in that particular school, give families greater educational choice, support exceptional teachers, and focus on basic academics, stressing accountability. 
   I have always thought, as a member of the Wyoming legislature, we cannot have a good school system without the dollars. Dollars alone do not necessarily result in a good school system. There has to be some accountability as well. 
   Of course, on the Federal level, the needs in Chugwater, WY, are quite different from those in Pittsburgh. Many  things are that way. There needs to be flexibility; in one particular school, perhaps what is most needed is to build a new school or replace the old school; in another school, what is needed is computers, teacher training, or more academic materials. ``One size fits all'' does not work. Frankly, that has been the underlying difficulty in this entire debate. 
   The President of the United States will be here this afternoon pushing for his plan so bureaucrats in Washington can decide and dictate what the Federal dollars are spent for. On the other side of that argument, we have given more dollars to the budget than even the President asked for. We are saying those ought to offer flexibility so local people can decide the best use for the dollars, yet with accountability for the taxpayers' dollars. 
   The Democratic approach has been a series of mandates: 100,000 federally funded teachers, federally funded school construction, federally funded afterschool. All those are fine if that is the priority in your particular school district. However, we are not in the business of having a bureaucracy in Washington make those decisions. 
   There have been difficulties moving forward: 
   The Taxpayer Relief Act, vetoed by the President, over $500 million in family tax relief--families could have used that money at any level to have supported schools; 
   Passing the Ed-Flex bill, with Federal requirements being waived if they are interfering with what they seek to do. 
   These are the items we are debating with regard to education. 
   We are, hopefully, near the end of this session. We will wind up next week. We have accomplished quite a number of things. Some people talk about a do-nothing Congress, which absolutely is not the case. The Republicans have balanced the budget, pushed forward and obtained the balanced budget in 1998, the first time since 1969 we have had a balanced budget. We saw that because of some restraints on spending, because of the flourishing economy bringing in more dollars. Nevertheless, it is the first time we have had enough dollars to balance the budget outside of Social Security dollars. We have changed the deficits to surpluses and lowered interest rates, paid down the debt $360 billion over the past 3 years. 
   In addition to that, of course, at the same time, Republicans have lowered the tax burden over the next 5 years. The tax cuts will provide the average household with almost $2,000 in tax relief. We enacted the $500 child tax credit that keeps $70 billion in the checking accounts for 25 million families. These are important things. We created the individual retirement accounts with IRAs to help families save more money, help people prepare for their own retirement, so that Social Security is a supplement, as it was designed to be. 
   The Republicans have stopped the raid on the Social Security trust fund and set aside Social Security funds so that they will be spent on Social Security and not borrowed and spent for other programs. We need to ensure that continues to be the case. 
   Welfare has been reformed and has helped Americans go back to work. In 1995, there were 13 million Americans on welfare. In 1996, there was reform, helping more than 6 million of those, nearly half, to be now employed--to be able to sustain themselves. That is really the purpose of Government programs. It is not to have a continuing source of relief but to provide an opportunity to help people help themselves, which not only is a good issue governmentally but, of course, individually it is something that is so important. 
   We strengthened the military. More needs to be done. We find ourselves in the situation where we have had more military deployments out of this country over the past 6 or 8 years than we have ever had in the past. We find ourselves, of course, in sort of a semipeaceful time but with a voluntary military, so we have to be able to compete somewhat with the private sector in pay so people will join. It is not only in the recruiting, of course, but the maintenance of people who have been trained so they will stay in the military. We have done that. We need to do more, of course. 
   We need to change the military. Our needs are different than they were 20 years ago. We are not going to see ourselves having to send 12 divisions with tanks somewhere. We are going to see ourselves with smaller, more flexible combat units moved quickly to a place with enough support to stay there for some time. 
   These are some of the things that continue to be important. I hope we continue to focus on them. Our job now, of course, is to get out about three or five more appropriations bills and fund those programs. I am a little discouraged at the amount of spending we have had this time. Much of that has come from pressure from that side of the aisle and the White House. They will not agree to appropriations bills unless they have all the things in them the President wants. He is entitled to do that. But this is one of the three units of Government, a separate unit. We ought to do those things we think are right and the President can do what he thinks is right. But I hope we do not get ourselves into a position where the President is deciding what we in the Congress do. That is not the system. We ought not be doing it that way. 
   I look forward to us moving forward, completing our work, and coming back with a new Congress, able to take a look at where we are going. I hope each of us, as Americans, gives some thought to where we would like to be, where we would like to see these various programs go--regardless of which you are looking at; whether you are looking at education; whether you are looking at reregulation of electricity; whether you are looking at the military. One of the difficulties is we move forward many times and make decisions that impact those issues without having a very clear-cut image of where we want to go. It is a little like Alice in Wonderland where she was wandering around and no one was able to tell her anything. She finally saw the Cheshire cat. There was a fork in the road and she said, ``Which one should I take?'' The cat said, ``Where are you going?'' ``I don't know,'' Alice replied. The cat said, ``Then it doesn't make any difference which road you take.'' 
   That is true. So we need to come with an idea of what our goal or mission is, where we want to end up over a period of time in education, and what are the steps we can best take to ensure that happens. Regarding Social Security, where do we want to be in 20 years or 30 years? These people who are paying 
   in 12.5 percent of their salaries into Social Security, are they going to have benefits 40 years from now when they are entitled to them? Not unless we make some changes. 
   The choices are fairly clear. You can raise taxes; people are not excited about that. You can cut benefits; that is probably not a good idea. One of the alternatives we are pursuing, and there may be others, is to take a portion of the Social Security dollars that have been paid in over time by younger people to make that decision for themselves--take a portion of that and have it invested on their behalf in their accounts in the private sector so the return, instead of being 2.5 percent, could be 5 percent or 6 percent. 
   People say: Well, look at the market now. Look at the market over time. The market over each 10-year period has grown fairly substantially. 
   So these are some of the things I hope we consider. I hope we consider them promptly so we are out next week. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I certainly join my friend from Texas. He spells out some things that are quite clear but obviously are not talked about very much. 
   I was listening earlier to my friend from North Dakota, who talked about the differences between the parties, between the Presidential candidates. Certainly there are differences. They talk about them being the same; they are not the same. I think there are some very clear philosophical choices to make. 
   Of course, that is why we are here. There is nothing unusual about having different points of view. Those points of view are very clear. Often we get involved in details and get bogged down in the choices in terms of direction and where we want to go, in terms of where we want the country to be in 10, 20, 50 years. That gets lost. They are the most important issues that we have. 
   One of them, in general terms is, what is the role of the Federal Government? How extensively does the Federal Government get involved in all the activities in our lives? What is the role of local government? Of course, most important is the role you and I, as individuals, have experienced over the past decade. 
   For nearly a decade, the idea was that whatever the problem was, it was up to the Federal Government to resolve it. Of course, much of that comes from politics. That is a great way 
   to get votes. There is a saying: You can teach a person to fish and they always have a fish; give them a fish and you will always have his vote. That is the political aspect. 
   There are some great differences: whether we have higher taxes; whether we have less taxes; what we do with the surplus that exists now. I think one of the real key issues is the division of authority, the division of responsibility between local governments and the Federal Government, State governments, county governments. These are the issues I believe are extremely important. This is, after all, a ``United'' States, a union of States, that each constitutionally has some very clear responsibilities. 
   One of the issues that has been most interesting, and as the Senator from Texas pointed out, has caused us to have a slower resolve in this Congress than usual, is the idea that there will be a surplus, a $5 trillion surplus over the next 10 years, $1.8 of that being non-Social Security. 
   There are several plans. One is to clearly put the Social Security money in the Social Security lockbox so it is used for Social Security, so that people who look forward to benefits, particularly young people, will have some feeling that there will be benefits; they are entitled to those benefits. Of course, as the demographics change--and they do change very much. I think originally there were 20 people working for every one drawing benefits, and now it is three working for every one drawing benefits--there will have to be changes in Social Security. 
   There are proposals for raising taxes. That is unpopular and not a good idea, in my view. There is some talk about reducing benefits. Again, I don't think that is the solution. One view is to give  an opportunity, a choice, particularly for young people, to have an opportunity to put a portion of the money they pay into their own account, to have it invested for the private sector and increase their return. Over a period of time, an increase in return from 2 1/2 percent to 5 1/2 percent is very significant. That is one view. 
   The opposite view is, no, we don't want to touch that. We are not going to touch Social Security. We don't want to change it. At the same time, we have had seven votes here about a lockbox and we have had resistance each time. There is a great deal of discussion and debate about philosophical differences in the approach. 
   We heard the candidates talk last night for the third time. Clearly, one point of view is to have a government health care program for everyone. I don't happen to agree with that. I think we talked about that. We tried to do that early on. We have seen the difficulties. So we ought to find an alternative solution. The alternative is to give people two choices to ensure health care, those particularly who cannot afford it. Those who want to have some choices are going to pay for them. 
   Similarly, with pharmaceuticals, an issue is to put it on every Medicare program, whether people really want it, whether people can afford it, as opposed to choices. There are real differences. 
   Taxes: Of course, we talked a great deal and will continue to talk about the idea of tax reduction, whether spending ought to be what we do with the surplus, which is basically the point of view of AL GORE--the largest spending since Lyndon Johnson and his proposals--or, on the other hand, we ought to take a 
   look at being sure we fund and finance those things that are there. We do education; we do Medicare; we do pharmaceuticals. When we are through with that, there will still be substantial amounts of money. It ought to go back to the people; it belongs to them; they paid in the money. We hear talk about it going to 1 percent of the population. The fact is, the 1 percent would be paying a higher percentage of the total taxes than they are now. I don't think there is much of an argument that people are entitled to some return. 
   The marriage penalty tax: Why should two married people pay more taxes, earning the same amount of money as when they were single, collectively? That is wrong. It was vetoed. 
   Estate tax: People spend their lives putting together estates, farms, ranches, businesses. It is not a question of not paying taxes. Capital gains taxes are paid on the increased value of those estates. But the idea that death should trigger a 52-percent tax on an estate that is already being taxed is a choice. 
   Those are different directions we take. I certainly agree with the idea that there are choices and there will be choices in this election, whether it be the Presidential election, whether it be the congressional election. And I hope each of us, as we exercise our responsibility as citizens in a government of the people and for the people and by the people, will take a look at those choices. Often it is difficult when we get off on a very specific issue and overlook the general direction and philosophy we want to take. That, it seems to me, is one of the most important things we have before the Senate. 
   I hope we can move forward and do our work. We have an obligation to do that and do it as quickly as we can. Certainly we want to stay here until we have completed the work in the manner in which we think it should be completed. The idea that we continue to stall, will continue to hold up appropriations bills so they can be joined with things that are unrelated, seems wrong to me. 
   I hope we move forward. More than anything as we move through this very important election cycle, I hope each of us takes a look at the direction we believe we should move toward. Should we have more Federal Government, more spending, more taxes? Should we have a Federal Government that deals with those essential items and funds them properly, reduces taxes so we don't have excess amounts of money here, 
   returns to local and State governments the kinds of responsibilities they have and, more importantly than that, returns to individuals the choices they can make in their lives and avoid having the Federal Government become the decisionmaker for each of them. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to go back to the remarks of the Senator from North Dakota as he talked about some of the issues that all of us are concerned about, issues such as pharmaceuticals--how we make that work; issues such as Medicare--which needs, after these years, some real, examination, some changes so over time we can ensure provision of health services to all who are beneficiaries. No one argues with that. 
   He also mentioned the Patients' Bill of Rights, which is interesting. I do not know of anyone in the Senate or the other body who is not for some form of the bill of rights. The unfortunate part is that there are some defining issues within that subject, defining issues that mean a lot in terms of where it goes in the future. The Senator failed to mention that. This is sort of the technique of those who favor more government. That is to simply talk about the title without talking about what is involved. 
   We have had in the Senate for a good long time--the Presiding Officer has participated--in a conference report, language designed to bring out a Patients' Bill of Rights that we could pass. Frankly, the Senator from North Dakota and others have opposed that. 
   One of the questions that is very important is whether or not it is going to be a bill of rights for patients or whether it is going to be a bill of rights for tort lawyers. If you have to go to court whenever there is a controversy, that is, of course, not what we seek to do. 
   So I want to make the point that you can talk in general 
   terms about many issues. Everyone embraces those issues. But when you talk about the kinds of things that are important, within those issues, to implement them in a manner in keeping with the philosophy that you have over time, then that becomes quite a different matter. Of course, that is why we find ourselves at some loggerheads from time to time.  
   I have spoken before, and will again, about the amount of effort we have seen from the other side of the aisle to put obstacles in front of these issues and to, really, be more interested in making an issue rather than a solution. I am sorry for that. We are, of course, down now to the end, and we need to do something. 
   Let me talk for a moment or two about some of the things I think we face, not only in this body right now but that we will face in the future, we will face in this election. We need to make decisions as to where we are going. The key to those decisions in my view, regardless almost of what the decisions are--whether they are business decisions, whether they are personal decisions, whether they are political decisions--is to get some idea of what we want the result to be and where we are going to go over a period of time, and then measure whether or not what we are doing in the interim leads us to the accomplishment of those goals. It seems to me that is one of the most important things we can do. 
   So we are going to find ourselves, I think--I half hope, maybe--with some different philosophies from this past year, and we are going to have to choose. 
   I just returned from my State. I am going to get back, I hope, pretty soon and spend some time in schools with a voting program to get kids involved in politics, involved in elections; to talk about the issues and begin to get some feel about what it means to have a government of the people and by the people and for the people. I am excited about that because there are differences in philosophy. 
   Sometimes we find it difficult to define them, as we have these debates, as we will have tomorrow night. It is true; politicians have a little affinity for making things a little bit blurred. But it is up to us, then, as voters, to really separate those things and decide where we want to go; do we want more Federal Government in our lives or do we want less? It is up to us to define what we think the role of the Federal Government is and how it impacts us as citizens. What is the role of local and State governments? What is the role, then, really of individuals? That is what it is all about: individual freedom--opportunities for success. 
   We talk about taxes. Do we want more taxes and more Government? Do we want less Government so people can keep more of the money they earn? The real issue, of course, is Federal control down into communities, down into counties, down into schools. Or, indeed, do we want county commissioners and school boards and State legislators to make decisions that fit the decisions made by the people who have to live with them. There is a great deal of difference between the needs we have for the delivery of services in Philadelphia and in Greybull, WY. So those are the kinds of things that are taken into account. 
   We have talked about a surplus. There are reports of a surplus, certainly. I might say, it is more difficult to control the size of Government when you have a surplus than it is when you do not because, regardless of what 
   the issues are, why, where we have a surplus we ought to spend the money. The other side of that, of course, is if we have a surplus there are certain priority things we ought to do but maybe we ought to put some of those surpluses back with the people who own them. They will be very important there. 
   We have different plans to deal with them. One of the plans that is out there takes about half of those surpluses and puts them into Social Security. One of the real issues before us is young people who are in their first jobs and pay 12.5 percent of their income, along with their employer, into the Social Security fund. In 40 years, are they going to have any benefits accruing to them? Not unless we make some changes. 
   The options are just to continue what we are doing and take more tax money to put into it, or to make some changes--for instance, to give some opportunities, based on the choice of the recipient, to put some of that money into the private sector, to get the return on that investment up from 2.5 to 3 percent, up to 4 percent or 5 percent or 6 percent, which certainly would make it more likely that those benefits are going to be there when their benefits are earned and ready to serve them. 
   When the Senator from North Dakota talked about tax cuts for the top 1 percent, that is not what is being proposed. Indeed, regarding the proposal that is out there that has caused all the 1 percent talk, the people who make the 1 percent, who make the most money in this country, will have a higher proportion of taxes on them than they have had before. Those taxes are for everyone who pays taxes. I think that is an excellent way to do that, to have marginal cuts and double the tax credits. Let's get rid of the estate tax. That doesn't do away with tax on the value, by the way, because that will be taxed when that asset is sold with the capital gains tax. But why should death cause you to have to sell the farm to pay the taxes? It should not. 
   These are some of the decisions that are out there to be made. Certainly they are important ones. I will not argue about what is right. We hear a lot of this: Let's do the right thing. 
   That depends on about whom you are speaking, what the right thing is, of course. So there are choices we have to make, legitimate choices. I hope all of us have a chance in this election to sort those out for ourselves and be able to do something with them. 
   Medicare is another one. I mentioned that before. You know, what we have is a Medicare program that, unless it is changed, cannot continue either. 
   There is something on which all of us can agree: We want to continue. If that is the goal, what do we have to do in the interim to ensure that happens? 
   One of the things we have to do is give people some choices. The way it is now, when you are 62, 63, 65, you have to take what is there, and that is the only choice. 
   There are people who have supplementary policies. My mother has a supplementary policy that provides pharmaceuticals. She is perfectly happy with that and wants to continue with that. There are people who do not have supplementary policies. They cannot afford them. They ought to have pharmaceutical coverage, and there ought to be choices in the way that is done. That is very possible. People ought to be able to choose. The alternative to what we suggested has no choice. 
   Education: It has been a very long time since we have been able to do something quite different on elementary and secondary education. We talked about it. We have had 5 weeks of discussion in this Congress on education. Again, everyone is for education. I do not know anyone who does not want to make education more effective, who does not want to make it better for everyone. What holds it up is who makes the decisions. 
   This administration has insisted on those dollars that go from the Federal Government to the States, regardless of what the needs are in a particular school district, that they either be for 100,000 more teachers or they be for buildings. Both of those are legitimate needs, but there are school districts that do not need more teachers and the school buildings are in pretty good shape. What they need is high-tech equipment, for example, and they should have an opportunity to spend that money as their needs dictate. That is the debate. 
   Sometimes it is a little hard to cut through: ``Those guys are against education.'' That is not so. These are the choices and these are the choices of how we get around to resolving the problems. I hope we will soon. 
   There are always going to be differences of view. That is why we vote. The problem is we have not been able to bring those things to the floor, and every time we bring up education, someone brings up one of the issues on which we have already voted three or four times--gun control, minimum wage, whatever--to make sure that what we are focusing on does not happen. 
   Here we are now 1 week past our dedicated time to adjourn. Frankly, I am one who thinks that if we have business to do here, we ought to be here until we get it done. That is our job. We ought to get the bills out here, vote on them, move them on up. If the President wants to veto them, if he wants to try to use leverage to threaten and shut down the Government, let him do that, but he is the one who is going to shut down the Government. That is where we are.  
   It is an interesting time, an important time. I am confident we will move more quickly to resolve these items this week than perhaps we have over the last couple of weeks.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to express my views on a more parochial issue--not entirely parochial, as a matter of fact; it has to do with access to national parks. I have served over the last 6 years as chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee. We have been very involved with where we are going and have hopefully some idea where we want to be with parks. 
   Everybody recognizes the value of the national assets. It is one of the neat things. In the United States, we have 379 national parks that work in conjunction, of course, with State parks and local parks. The reasons for having a park, it seems to me, are, No. 1, to preserve the resource, of course, and, No. 2, to allow that resource to be enjoyed by the people who own it --the taxpayers. 
   We have a little difficulty from time to time with both of those things. We passed a bill, Parks 2020, last year which puts more emphasis on inventory, taking care of the resources. We need to put more effort into that, and we are working on that. 
   We have had a lot of talk about infrastructure in some of the larger parks and the things that need to be done, the money that needs to be spent for preserving the resource, such as on sewers. In the last budget that came from this administration, there was more money for acquisition of new parks than there was for maintenance of the parks we have. To me that is a problem. 
   If you want to enjoy it, you have to have access. One of the things that is controversial in our part of the world--in Yellowstone, Teton Park--which is equally true in New England and other places, is access for snow machines. For 3 years we have had an ongoing study in Yellowstone Park prompted by a lawsuit. Today they are coming out with their report on the environmental study and their recommendations as to what we should do. It is out for public comment for 30 days. I am going to ask that the 30 days be extended to 60 so people have an opportunity to review it. 
   There are difficulties with snow machines. There is difficulty with the noise. There is some difficulty with the pollution. The problem is the Park Service for 20 years has not sought to manage that growing industry and has simply avoided doing anything with it. Then suddenly there is a lawsuit filed against them, and there are some things that need to be changed. Instead of seeking to manage it, instead of seeking to find some remedies, instead of seeking to make some changes, they simply want to eliminate it. That is a mistake. There are ways the Park Service can manage those things. They can separate cross-country skiers from snowmobilers. They can limit the number if there are too many. But the EPA and the Park Service have never looked toward establishing standards for these machines. 
   I have visited a number of times with the manufacturers, and they are willing to change those machines. They did some experimental work in Jackson Hole, WY, last year and had machines that are only as loud as normal voices. Of course, no one is going to invest in those unless they have some idea that there are standards, and if they comply with them, they will be useful. 
   I hope we can change the idea of either nothing or no management and give some time to move toward the adjustments that can be made, toward some management in the parks so people can continue to enjoy them. 
   I see my friend from Kansas. I yield to the Senator from Kansas.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to speak about energy, which seems to be one of the things I think is very important that people are talking about. But first I wish to comment a little on the progress, or lack thereof, that we are making in the Senate. It is not unusual that we come up to the end of the session and find ourselves kind of blocked up here, and things have been postponed until now. Of course, it is the appropriations bills that always end up in this category. We have 13 of them to pass in order to keep the Government going. The fiscal year expired at the end of September, of course. We have extended our time and will do it into next week again. 
   One of the important roles of Congress is this allocation of funding. It is one that is very important and really needs to be given all the attention we can give it. I think we ought to move as quickly as we can to do that job. I hope we don't end up with huge omnibus bills at the end of the session. They are so large that people don't know what is in them. I would rather we deal with them individually as much as possible. Let me say that one of the things we ought to consider, which I have supported since I have been in the Congress--and from my experience in the Wyoming Legislature--is I think we ought to have a 2-year budgeting arrangement, which would alleviate this sort of thing every year. Nevertheless, we are not there. 
   However, we need to move forward. When we are ready with the appropriations bills, we ought to do that. I favor the bill being talked about here. I think it is a good bill. I don't know why it wasn't brought up earlier in the week 
   when we were sitting here and didn't have anything before us. Now we are down to the last hours of this week and we bring up something that stops the opportunity for us to pass legislation regarding appropriations. I think that is unfortunate. In any event, we ought to be doing that. 
   Obviously, one of the difficulties with appropriations has been this idea of attaching to them the kinds of things that are not within the appropriations process because it is the end of the session, and because they have not been handled, or some refused to handle them earlier. That was wrong, in my opinion. I hope we consider a rule that would make that more difficult.

I simply want to rise again to say I do not disagree at all with what the Senator from California is saying. But the fact is, there is a plan. There is a plan to operate under here. The Senate does not simply react because someone gets up and says it is time to do this. There are negotiations going on between the leader and Senators on the other side. 
   I am sure this will indeed be done. We have a lot of things that need to be done. I would suggest that we ought to get the whole thing planned a little bit. I am a little surprised that this Senator is talking about objecting to moving forward because I think there have been quite a few objections coming from that side that has gotten us to where we are now. That is not really the point. The point is, we will handle this bill. The leader has prepared to do that.

   Mr. THOMAS. I appreciate the opportunity to visit just a moment on a subject that is very close to my heart and very close to my interests. I am from Wyoming, a State that has open space throughout a great deal of the State. It is the eighth largest State in the United States and still the smallest population. I grew up near Yellowstone Park. Those are things I feel very strongly about. 
   I want to do two things--one, to comment on the good proposal of the Senator from Louisiana and her passionate defense of it. I understand that. I respect that a great deal. There are some things that are disadvantageous about CARA that we have talked about. One, of course, is the idea it makes it mandatory spending for 15 years. This is an entitlement. As we look at our budget now, about a third of our budget is up to the Congress to allocate. The rest of it is entitlements. 
   I came from serving in the Wyoming Legislature where the legislature now only has control over 25 percent of the dollars. I think that is a dangerous position, and entitlements become a real problem. 
   Also, as we look toward the land acquisition, there are a number of things we need to be concerned about in this year's budget. From this administration, there was more interest on the purchase plan than the maintenance plan. We have 379 parks in this country, most of which are in desperate need of infrastructure help, but it seems as if the more popular thing to talk about is the acquisition of more land. Fifty 
   percent of my State belongs to the Federal Government; 85 percent of Nevada in the west along the Rocky Mountain area, most of the land now belongs to the Federal Government. 
   We asked in committee if we could have some kind of protection in this allocation of CARA of $45 billion, that we would not have any more Federal land; that, indeed, if Federal lands were to be purchased, we would have an opportunity to dispose of some Federal land so there would be basically no net gain. It seems to me that is reasonable. The supporters of CARA were not willing to talk about that. 
   In conclusion, I think there is a great deal of merit in the bill before the Senate. It isn't, of course, what everyone wants. There are more expenditures to it than some like. It does reflect help however, for the losses that were incurred because of the forest fires--6.6 million acres in the West burned this year and the costs associated and the losses associated there. 
   I am going to support this bill. I am pleased. I thank the chairman for his good work in getting this bill before the Senate. 
   I will comment on the fact that not only in this bill but in a number of bills there are authorizations for things I think are inappropriately authorized in appropriations bills. In this bill there are some parks, for example, and set-asides which certainly ought to come from the authorizing committee, not from the Appropriations Committee. 
   I understand what happens. We get toward the end of the year, and there are things there, people want something to happen and we are in danger of having a lot of that happen in the next week or so. I hope it does not. We have a system where there is an authorization and there is an appropriation. 
   I don't think anyone in this place is more anxious to have dollars available to do something with conservation, to do something with preservation, to do something with easements, to do something with maintenance of the land we already have, but I think we have to make sure those bills, indeed, have the composition that makes them the kinds of things that we need to have in this Congress and that is to have them authorized yearly or at least in shorter spans than 15 years. 
   I yield the floor.

This is legislation that will extend the authorization for the Air Force Memorial Foundation until December 2, 2005. I, along with my fellow marines, fully support the effort to recognize with an appropriate monument the selfless service and sacrifices of the many valiant veterans of the Air Force and its predecessor organizations. 
   I also note the Air Force Memorial Foundation has already begun the process of considering and selecting sites. In pursuing that effort, I encourage the foundation to identify a location that will suitably express an appropriate theme and do so in a manner that does not infringe upon or detract from other prominent memorials. 
   In this regard, I note the property known as the Arlington Naval Annex overlooking the Pentagon, the southeast portion of Arlington Cemetery, will soon be available. This location offers a suitable prominent setting for the memorial, and I hope it will be fully considered by the Air Force. 
   As this entire process moves forward, I request the Air Force carefully consider this property and report its findings to my Subcommittee on National Parks and the rest of the Senate Energy Committee. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. 
   As I have said before, energy is terribly important to all of us. It is particularly important to those of us who come from producer States. But perhaps if you come from a part of the country where there is no production and the cost continues to go up, you are even more concerned. In New England, that is pretty much the case. 
   In any event, we do have a problem in energy and we have to find solutions. We have two very different points of view in terms of what our needs are and how we meet them. 
   Many wonder, of course, why gas and diesel prices are so high. Heating oil will be very expensive. I come from a production State, and it wasn't long ago that oil in our oil fields was bringing less than $10 a barrel. Now, of course, in the world price, we are up in the thirties. Part of that, of course--I think the major part--is that we have relatively little impact on the price. We have allowed ourselves, over a period of time, to become dependent upon importation of oil. We have not had, in my view, an energy policy. We have had 8 years of an administration that really has not wanted to deal with the idea of having a policy in terms of where we are going. 
   I have become more and more convinced--it is not a brand new idea, but I think it doesn't often get applied--that we have to set policies and goals for where we need to be over a period of time. And then, as we work toward that, we can measure the various things we do with respect to attaining that goal. If our goal is--and I think it should be--that we become less dependent upon imported oil, then we have to make some arrangements to be there. That has not been the case. 
   This administration, on the other hand, has basically gone the other way and has indicated that we ought to reduce our domestic production. In fact, our consumption requirements have gone up substantially over the last couple of years--about 14 percent. During the same period of time, domestic production has gone down approximately 17 percent. 
   In 1990, U.S. jobs in exploring and producing oil and gas were about 400,000 or 500,000 people. In 1999, the number of people doing the same thing was about 293,000--a 27-percent decline. 
   Why is this? Part of it is because we haven't really had 
   this goal of how we were going to meet our energy demands and then measure some of the things that have brought us to where we are. On the contrary, the policy pursued from this administration has been one that has made domestic production even more difficult than it was in the beginning--and more difficult than it needs to be, as a matter of fact. 
   So I guess you can talk about releasing oil from our strategic storage. I don't make as big a thing out of it as some, but that is not a long-term answer. It is a relatively small amount of oil compared to our usage--about a day and a half's usage--and it is not going to make a big difference in terms and no difference to where we are in being able to have domestic production in the future. I set that aside. I only warn that that can't be offered as a solution to the energy problem. That seems to be about all this administration is prepared to do. 
   On the contrary, going back over some time, in 1993 the first Btu tax increased the cost of a gallon of gas about 8 cents. The compromise was about 3 cents, with the Vice President casting the deciding vote. Now, of course, the effort is to manipulate the price of the storage oil, but it won't do that. As I said, it is only about 1 and a half day's supply. 
   We find our refineries now producing at about 95-percent capacity, partly because of some of the restrictions placed on these facilities. Some have gone out of business, and practically none has been built. We find natural gas, of course, becoming increasingly important. Fifty percent of U.S. homes and 56 million people rely on natural gas for heating. It provides 15 percent of our power. It will provide more in that this administration has also moved basically against the use of coal, which is our largest producer of electric energy, instead of finding ways to make coal more acceptable. The coal industry has been working hard on that. We have low-sulfur coal in my State. This administration has pushed against that, and we have therefore had less use than we had before. 
   So what do we do? I think certainly there are a number of things we can do. There does need to be a policy. A policy is being talked about by George Bush, which is supported generally here in the Senate--that would be No. 1--to help low-income households with their energy bills and put some more money in as a short-term solution to help with the low-income energy assistance program. We can do that. We can direct a portion of all the gas royalty payments to that program and offset some of the costs over time. We are always going to have the need, it seems to me, regardless of the price, for low-income assistance. We can do that. And we can establish a Northeast management home heating reserve to make sure home heating is available for the Northeast. We should use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve only in times of real crises--not price, but crises such as the wars of several years ago. 
   We need to make energy security a priority of U.S. foreign policy. We can  do a great deal with Canada and Mexico. It seems we ought to be able to exercise a little more influence with the Middle East. Certainly, we have had a lot to do with those countries in the past--being helpful there. I think we can make more of an impact in Venezuela than we have. I think we can support meetings of the G-8 energy ministers, or their equivalent, more often. 
   Maybe most importantly, we have lots of resources domestically, and instead of making them more difficult to 
   reach, we ought to make it easier. I come from a State that is 50-percent owned by the Federal Government. Of course, there are places such as Yellowstone Park and Teton Park where you are never going to do minerals and should not. Much of that land is Bureau of Land Management land that is not set aside for any particular purpose. It was there when the homestead stopped and was simply residual and became public land. It is more multiple use. We can protect the environment and continue to use it--whether it is for hiking, hunting, grazing, or whether indeed for mineral exploration and production, as we now do. 
   This administration has made it difficult to do that. We can improve the regulatory process. I not only serve on the Energy Committee, but on the Environment and Public Works Committee. Constantly we are faced with new regulations that make it more difficult, particularly for small refineries, to live within the rules. Many times they just give it up and close those. We can change that. It depends on what we want to do with the policy. It depends on our goals and what we want to do with domestic production and whether or not these kinds of things contribute to the attainment of those goals. It is pretty clear that they don't. 
   I think we can find ways to establish clear rules to have some nuclear plants that are safe, so they indeed can operate. They are very efficient. We talk about the environment. They are friendly to the environment. We need to do something. Of course, if we are going to do that, as they do in France and the Scandinavian countries, we can recycle the waste, or at least after a number of years we can have a waste storage at Yucca Mountain, NV. This administration has resisted that entirely, as have many Members on the other side of the aisle. 
   So these are all things that could be done and are being talked about. We are talking about breaching dams. I think everybody wants to look for alternative sources. We ought to use wind and solar. But the fact is that those really generate now about 2 percent of the total usage that we have. Maybe they will do more one of these days. I hope they do. We have some of that in my State as well. As a matter of fact, my business built a building about 20 years ago, and we fixed it up with solar power. I have to admit it didn't work very well. It works better now, and we can continue to make it work better, but it is not the short-term answer to our energy problems. 
   We can do something with ANWR. I have gone up to the North Slope of Alaska. You can see how they do the very careful extraction. You have to get the caribou out of the way. But you can see what is going on. That can be done. I am confident it can be done. 
   Those are some of the things that are suggested and which I think ought to have real consideration. It is difficult sometimes to try to reconcile environmental issues. I don't know of anyone who doesn't want to do that. Environmental protection has to be considered, but it doesn't mean you have to do away with access. 
   Quite frankly, one of the real problems we have in some States is how to use open spaces. We are doing something in my State about protecting the environment and protecting public land. Too many people say you just shouldn't use it for anything at all. When some States, such as Nevada and others, are up as high as 85 percent in Federal ownership, I can tell you it is impossible to have an economy in those States and take that attitude. On the other hand, I am persuaded that we can have reasonable kinds of programs that allow multiple use and at the same time protect the future use of those lands. It seems to me those are the kinds of things we ought to be doing. 
   It is very difficult. It is certainly easy to set energy policy back, particularly when the price has gone up as it has. I think all of us remember a year or so ago when the price at the gas pump was down as low as 86 cents a gallon. Now in my State it is as high as $1.60. You think about it a lot more when it is $1.60 than when it is 86 cents. We didn't complain much about the producers then. But now we are pretty critical. We need a policy. 
   That is the opportunity we have in this Congress--to really establish some of the byways and roadways to help us achieve a reduction on our dependency on foreign oil. We need to move toward changes in consumption and in the way we travel. I have no objection to that. The fact is, that is going to take time. The economy, the prosperity, and the security of this country depends a great deal on an ample and available energy source. It requires an energy policy. It requires the administration to step up to the plate and work with this Congress to continue to work to establish an energy policy. 
   That is our task. That is our challenge. I think it is a necessary movement in order to continue to have freedom and economic prosperity. 
   I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to go back a little bit to one of the issues that is before us that has to do with energy and energy policy. 
   Certainly, we are faced at the moment with some real difficulties in terms of winter use of heating oil. 
   There are differences of view as to what we do with the strategic storage. I understand that. 
   But aside from that, I think in one way or another we certainly need to help those people who will need help this winter in terms of price and in terms of availability. 
   We had a hearing yesterday with the Secretary of Energy. Quite frankly, I didn't get any feel for where we are going in the long term. What we have done here, of course, over the last number of years with the fact that this administration has had an energy policy--some have accused them of having no policy; I suggest there has been a policy--is to basically not do anything to encourage, and, in fact, discourage, domestic production. The result of that, of course, has been that since 1992, U.S. oil production is down 17 percent and consumption is up 14 percent. We have had a reduction since 1990 in U.S. jobs producing and exploring for oil. At that point, we had over 400,000 workers. Now to do the same thing, the number is down 27 percent. 
   We have had a policy that despite the increased use of energy, which is not to be unexpected in this kind of a prosperous time, we have sought to reduce exploration, and we have become more dependent on foreign oil. We are now nearly 57-percent dependent on OPEC for providing our energy sources. 
   There are a number of things we could be doing that would certainly help alleviate that problem. 
   One is access to public lands in the West. Of course, in Wyoming 50 percent of the land belongs to the Federal Government. In some States, it is as much as 85 percent. 
   As we make it more difficult for our oil exploration and production to show up on Federal lands with multiple use, then we see that production go down. 
   As we put more and more regulations on refiners and have reformulated gasoline, it makes it more difficult. Older refineries have to go out of business. We then find it more difficult to be able to process the oil that we indeed have which is there to be used. 
   We also, of course, have an opportunity in many ways to produce energy. We could have a very healthy nuclear energy system if we could go ahead and move forward with storage out at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. We have not been able to do that. 
   We could certainly use more low-sulfur coal. 
   But we continue to put regulations on the production of those things. 
   One of the things that seemed fairly clear yesterday was that the Department of Energy has relatively little to do with energy policy, even if they choose to. The policy is being made by the Environmental Policy Council in the White House. It is being made by EPA. It is being made by these other kinds of regulatory agencies. Obviously, all of us want to continue to work to have clean air. Air is much cleaner than it was. 
   I think what we need to recognize is one of the things that came out again yesterday. Vice President GORE announced some time ago that there would be no more drilling. That is the kind of policy that has been developed. 
   What we ought to be doing is taking a longer look at where we are going with energy and have some idea of what we will do over the years. It is one thing to be able to work in the next 2 or 3 months and argue about how you do that. But the real issue is where we are in the next year and the year after in those areas where energy is such an important part of our economy.  
   I am hopeful that the outcome of what we have here with this current dilemma with respect to energy will result in a real, honest-to-goodness debate, discussion, and decision with respect to long-term energy policy and increased access to public lands for potential oil and gas in the Rocky Mountains, offshore, and in Alaska, and at the same time develop techniques where we can do it and also take care of the environment. It is not a choice between the two things. 
   We should develop tax incentives to try to encourage increases in oil and gas production, particularly in stripper wells. In old production wells, it really hasn't been economic to do that. 
   We can do some things with respect, of course, to research. We have been working now for a couple of years on a mineral management group to be able to clarify how those charges are made, and we have been unable to do that over a period of time. 
   There are a number of things: The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, we now have in my State a real activity going on with methane gas production--gas production that we need now under the Clean Water Act. Some Senators are pushing against insertions of fracture used to help with that production. 
   These things are all, of course, inconsistent with some kind of policy which will, indeed, move us forward in terms of energy development. 
   Refineries are already up to 95 percent of capacity or more. So to actually take oil out of the reserve, if there isn't a refinery capacity, makes it very difficult. Everyone recognizes the difficulty in the Northeast, the major user of oil for heating in the wintertime. That has traditionally been important. We do need to do some things there. We need to provide more fuel. We need also, I am sure, to do something about low-income users. 
   There are a number of things we need to do. I hope we don't totally get involved in making this a political issue. Rather than trying now to point out what everyone has done or hasn't done, we ought to say, all right, here is where we are; now what do we do? How much can we do to develop domestic production? What are the best ways to do that? How can we move in that direction? How soon can we move forward with that?

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are supposed to vote here at 4:30, so I want  to take a few minutes while we have a little time to talk about an issue that is very important to me and, I think, very important to many people in this country that has to do with rural health care. 
   I am cochairman of the Rural Health Care Caucus in the Senate. We are faced with a number of issues, of course, in health care for everyone. But one of the issues we always have to work at is the notion that when you have low population areas, rural areas, then the provision of health care and delivery of health care is different than it is in urban areas, than it is in city areas. So, from time to time, we have to make some different kinds of adjustments. That is what our Rural Health Care Caucus seeks to do. 
   It is also interesting that although Wyoming is certainly one of the rural States, almost every State has rural areas. Even New York, which we never think of that way, has, I think, a higher percentage of people who live in cities than any other State; so, therefore, they have rural areas as well. 
   I want to take a minute to bring to the attention of the Senate what I consider to be current inequities in the Medicare program that do not address the unique and different needs of rural Medicare providers and beneficiaries in my State and across the country. 
   Rural health care beneficiaries--those who utilize the program--tend to be poorer, tend to have more chronic illnesses than their urban counterparts. There is generally a higher proportion of seniors in rural areas. Rural providers generally serve a higher proportion of Medicare patients and therefore, of course, are impacted and are highly susceptible to changes and reductions in Medicare reimbursements for the services they provide. 
   It is because of these unique circumstances that rural providers and beneficiaries are working now to put into whatever package we come up with, as this Congress comes to a close, that which strengthens Medicare. 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 asked for some reductions. Unfortunately, HCFA, the agency that handles the disbursements for Medicare, reduced those payments a great deal more than asked for by Congress. It had been provided at one time to bring them up again. There is an effort being made to have a sort of payback arrangement from the BBA this year as well. 
   So there are a number of specific provisions I hope will be considered that do pertain to rural areas and are specifically pertinent to rural Medicare providers. 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reduced the annual inflation --the market basket it was called--update that hospitals usually received in order to make the payments even with inflation. In fiscal years 2001 and 2002, hospitals were 
   slated to receive a market basket which would have been the inflation minus 1.1 percent as an update. Unfortunately, studies demonstrate that because of the reductions, many rural hospitals have margins now that hover below that. So we are really interested in that. This market basket payback does reflect what the increased inflationary costs are. I think that is terribly important as we move forward. 
   We need to revise the disproportionate share hospital payment formula. A majority of those hospitals serve large numbers of seniors who are in low-income brackets and receive little or no Medicare payments because of the differential qualifications for rural and urban hospitals. 
   Rural and sole community hospitals must meet a higher threshold of criteria of 45 percent and 30 percent than their urban counterparts. So here again is a certain amount of unfairness in these kinds of payments and distributions. 
   So we are asking that the committee apply the threshold of the 15 percent of having these kinds of patients, to make it fair and equitable--which is currently what it is in urban hospitals--rather than the 30 percent. 
   The wage index: Here again we have the formula that applies to most hospitals. The local wage index is considered to be about 70 percent of the total cost. However, that is not true in rural hospitals, where it is more like 50 or 60 percent. So when that adjustment is made, our hospitals in the rural areas have lower wages and, therefore, are unfairly penalized. So we are asking that each of them be assessed on what their average percentage really is. 
   Rural home health agencies are not able to spread out their fixed costs. They are not able to generally include the costs of the excessive traveling that takes place in rural areas. That needs to be changed. 
   Medicare-dependent hospitals: We find that this program was established in 1989 to provide special protections to rural hospitals that serve a high proportion of Medicare patients. They used the old figures that were there. We need to do something about that. 
   So there are a number of areas in rural health care that need to be justified, and hopefully can be justified, as we move forward toward the kind of changes that ought to be made to bring this balanced budget business back into play and to be fair. 
   All we are asking for is fairness as we compare the different kinds of hospitals. We found some time ago that the payments made in Florida were much larger than payments made for the same kind of services in Wyoming. Now there is some adjustment in terms of cost, and so on, but not nearly the kind of adjustment that showed up in the payments. We have made some improvements on that. I think it is something we have to continue to look at as we revise the criteria. 
   Last year, we also established a critical access hospital arrangement for small communities that could not sustain a hospital with all the full requirements that are necessary in an urban hospital, so their hospitals could be listed so they could be paid for their services under Medicare. 
   We do have community access hospitals which basically are clinics. People can take care of emergencies knowing, if it is a serious illness or a serious accident, they can be moved to another location, but the community access hospitals can provide the emergency care that is needed and can be paid for it out of Medicare. That is simply a very reasonable, sensible, fair, and equitable thing that needed to be changed and was. I am pleased about that. 
   I am looking for ways to increase the program which entices providers to come to rural areas where they could pay off part of their educational expenses by serving in areas of low population in the United States. That is just one of the things, as we complete this session, that needs to be done. I hope it will be done. And as that happens, I am very anxious that the uniqueness of our rural communities be recognized and that we have fairness based on that. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to suggest something that is very exciting for those of us in Wyoming and, I think, all over the country. I will start with a headline off of the Internet: ``American Stops Russian's 13-year Streak.'' 
   It says:  
   ``I cannot believe I actually won,'' said the 286-pound Rulon Gardner, and he was not alone.  
   He wasn't expected to win. He is a wrestler from Star Valley, WY, weighing 286 pounds. This was really an incredible thing. Listen to this:  
   Just how invincible was the Russian Icon he beat? Alexander Karelin had not lost a match in international competition in 14 years. Only one point had been scored against him by an opponent in 10 years. He'd won gold in the past three Olympics. The American who wrestled him in Atlanta in 1996, respected silver medalist Matt Ghaffari, faced him 22 times over his career and lost every time.  
   He is a huge guy and has done this great, great job of wrestling throughout the years. In fact, it seemed so certain he would win again that the Olympic Committee president was there to present him with the medal. Sure enough, that did not happen. The unthinkable happened, in fact, and our man scored a point. Gardner scored a point early on and maintained that point, and now he is the gold medal winner in heavyweight wrestling at the world Olympics. 
   He grew up the youngest of nine in Afton, WY, population 1,400. 
   He went to college and wrestled there. Before wrestling, he also played a little football. But he has been wrestling for some time and had a chance to go to the Olympics this year. This is the first Olympic gold for a U.S. wrestler since 1984. 
   We are especially proud in Wyoming to have had a number of athletes in the Olympics. But we are really so proud of this one in particular, who, as of yesterday, had the gold medal in heavyweight wrestling. 
   I couldn't resist the opportunity to recognize that. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, I would like to extend my appreciation and congratulations to former Ambassador Edward Masters on the occasion of his retirement on October 18 from his position as President of United States-Indonesia Society. 
   During his 30-year career in the Foreign Service, in which he reached the senior rank of Career Minister, Ambassador Masters served as U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia and Bangladesh and Deputy Chief of Mission to Thailand. He also held posts in India and Pakistan and an assignment as director of the State Department's Office of East Asian Regional Affairs that involved policy coordination for the entire area. 
   Indonesia figured prominently in both Ambassador Masters' diplomatic and private sector careers. As Political Counselor of the United States Embassy in Jakarta from 1964-68, he worked on reconstructing U.S. relations with Indonesia at a very difficult time. This included closing out our economic aid, information and Peace Corps programs because of the highly adverse political situation in Indonesia. Toward the end of that period, he worked with various elements of the U.S. Government and NGOs to reinstitute some of those programs but to do so in a way commensurate with Indonesian culture and sensitivities. He is, in fact, particularly known in both Indonesia and the United States for his ability to work effectively in the Indonesian environment. 
   As United States Ambassador from late 1977 until the end of 1981, one of his major responsibilities was managing a large and very important economic aid program. He worked in particular and in detail on the Provincial Development Program, the programs to expand Indonesia's food grain production and enhance human resources development. Toward the end of his tour he organized various elements of the mission to develop programs to get the U.S. Government more effectively behind the programs to develop Indonesia's private sector and increase cooperation between that sector and the United States. 
   In 1994, Ambassador Masters was instrumental in forming the United States-Indonesia Society. The Society is the preeminent institution in the United States devoted to developing a broad range of programs aimed at developing greater awareness and appreciation about Indonesia and the importance of the U.S.-Indonesia relationship in all major sectors in the U.S. Ambassador Masters has given briefings throughout the United States to academic institutions and other interested groups. He has provided witness testimony on numerous occasions before the Senate and House Foreign Relations Subcommittees on East Asian and Pacific Affairs on numerous occasions. He has organized conferences and other forums bringing Indonesians and Americans together to discuss short and long-term issues of mutual concern. One such conference he organized last October in cooperation with the Embassy of Indonesia in Washington DC., brought some of the most impressive, influential, and knowledgeable individuals from Indonesia and the United States to discuss the 50 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries and to provide policy suggestions to both governments on how to strengthen ties in the new millennium. 
   On September 28, 1998 the Indonesian government recognized Ambassador Masters' valuable contributions and decorated him with the Bintang Mahaputra Utama, the second highest  award given by the Government of Indonesia for his commitment and contribution to forging closer ties between the U.S. and Indonesia. 
   As Chairman, I would also like to recognize and say thanks Ambassador Masters for the valuable work he has done. When I began my tenure as Chairman, Indonesia was--unfortunately--largely ignored in the United States. Despite being the fourth largest country in the world, and the largest Muslim country, its accomplishments and its importance to the United States as a friend and ally were largely overlooked and reduced to occasional tongue-lashings regrading Timor Timur. 
   I made changing that situation a top priority of my chairmanship. And my job was made a lot easier by Ambassador Masters. 
   The United States-Indonesia Society has greatly shaped, increased awareness and knowledge and provided support to those of us in the United States, including both houses of Congress, the administration and the government, the press, NGO community, academia and the population at large on the importance of Indonesia to the United States. Over the last two years this Society has become even more essential in helping the United States to understand the complex dynamics involved in moving from an authoritarian regime to the third largest democracy in the world. 
   I understand why Ambassador Masters has decided to step down as President; he has earned the respite. But those of us concerned with the U.S.-Indonesia relationship will surely miss him and his steady hand at the tiller. I can only profoundly thank him for his many years of public service to the United States, and to his life-long commitment to improving relations between the United States and Indonesia. As the Indonesians would say, ``Terima kasih banyak.''

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have been in some meetings this morning. Of course, we do not have any more committee hearings going on because the other side has objected to that. I haven't listened to everything, but I heard enough to hear my friends on the other side of the aisle complaining about not moving forward. 
   So I just believe it is really important to talk a little bit about the whole idea of what has been going on here now for several months, where we have been seeking to make some reforms and seeking to move forward, moving a number of bills, and finding nothing but roadblocks from the other side of the aisle. It is almost hilarious to hear that kind of conversation when the facts are that we have had nothing but roadblocks coming from the other side of the aisle. And it is too bad. 
   We are down to where we don't have a great deal of time, and the notion that we continue to bring up the same topics, over and over and over again, simply because these folks want to make it an issue as opposed to a solution, frankly, gets pretty redundant and tiresome. 
   Let me just mention a few of the things specifically that 
   have been troublesome.

I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 hours for debate equally divided between the two managers, with an additional hour under the control of Senator MCCAIN, 1 hour under the control of Senator THOMAS, and 90 minutes under the control of Senator KENNEDY. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the adoption of the conference report, with no intervening action or debate. I add, provided that 30 minutes of the Democrat manager's time be under the control of Senator WELLSTONE.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to take a couple of minutes to talk a little bit about where we are, where we are going, and what we face this week and the few remaining weeks we have before us. There will be some more Senators to come over to the floor shortly to talk about some of the issues we have before us, particularly debt reduction, which we are committed to undertake this week, and I think is one of the most important things we can do. We will be talking, of course, about many of the things that are left to discuss. 
   We have done a number of things in this Congress, of course, and we have a number of things yet to do, particularly appropriations. Those appropriations need to be finished by the end of the fiscal year which is the end of September. So we have a very short time to handle these things. We have worked at it for a good long time. We seem to have had a repetition of obstructions to moving forward. 
   I hope we are now in a position to go ahead and fund those programs that have been authorized, that are out there for the American people, and that we do not find ourselves using this time to begin to insert into these bills all kinds of things that have already been discussed and that are intended more to create an issue than they are to find a solution. 
   There have been, of course, a number of very important things done this year; we need to recognize that. I guess people have different ideas about how many things and what kinds of things. There is a great difference in the view of the direction this Government should take and what is the role of the Federal Government, whether the Government ought to tells us what to do or whether, in fact, the Government's role is to establish a framework in which we make our own decisions at the local level, as opposed to being dictated to by the Washington bureaucracy. 
   These are some of the big issues. We passed the marriage tax relief bill here in the Congress. That would have been largely a resolution to an issue of fairness, where two single persons, each earning X amount of dollars and paying X in taxes, when they get married, making the same dollars, pay a larger amount of taxes. Unfair? Of course. Unfortunately, that bill was vetoed by the President, so we will have to take it up at another time. I do not think it will be taken up this year. Obviously, the White House is determined they will not permit tax relief of this kind. 
   We passed the elimination of the death tax. That is very important. Some indicated it was only for the very wealthy. Of course that is not true. We have very many people in my State of Wyoming in the agriculture business, small businesses, families that have put together--sometimes over generations--a business. That business then has to be disposed of because they have to pay 52 percent taxes. That, of  course, was also vetoed by the President. 
   We did get some tax relief. Very important was elimination of the Social Security earnings test, which eliminates the tax on earnings by seniors 65 to 69. Previous to that, seniors in that category lost a dollar in Social Security benefits for every $3 earned. Again, I think it is largely a fairness proposition and we are pleased that did happen. 
   The digital signatures bill, of course, is very important as we move into a new era in the business activities of our Nation. The digital signatures bill makes it easy for people to 
   have legal protection in contracts of that kind. 
   On national security, the Iran Nonproliferation Act was very important for free trade. It dealt with free trade in the sub Sahara, Africa, and the Caribbean. It is important those things continue to be done. I come from a State where agriculture is very important. Nearly 40 percent of our agricultural products are sold for export. We find ourselves dealing with unilateral sanctions, which often limit what we can sell to those people. Then they go somewhere else for it. We made some progress in that area, certainly. I hope we will make some more. 
   We have done a good deal of work on affordable education; education savings accounts. We made available $500-$2,000 in tax relief for education. We need to get that forwarded. 
   Also, with health care, we passed a Patients' Bill of Rights that says you can appeal, but the first appeal goes to a medical professional and not to lawyers. I think that is the better way to go. The opposition, of course, has seen to it that it ultimately not pass, but it has passed here. 
   We passed bankruptcy reform which provided that if persons were able to repay at least a portion of their debt, that was an appropriate thing to do. 
   So we have made a substantial amount of progress. We have, I think, many issues we need to discuss that are terribly important. This is a place for decisions on the direction we take, which is what elections are about, and the direction that you and I as voters and as citizens believe the country ought to move. There are legitimate differences. That is really what we deal with. Unfortunately, many times we do not get down to what those real differences are but get tied up in other things. 
   On education, for example, I do not think there is a Senator in this place who doesn't believe education is one of the most important issues before us. Almost everyone in the country thinks that. The question is not that. The question is, What kind of educational support do we expect from the Federal Government? The amount the Government contributes from the Federal level is about 7 percent, but it is substantial. It deals with certain things such as special education. The real issue has not been that. The real issue is whether the Federal bureaucracy should tell the school districts what they ought to do with that Federal money or whether, indeed, we send it there and say they may have unique problems and need to spend their money for different things. The needs in Pinedale, WY, are different than they are in Pittsburgh, PA. We believe that. That has been the difference. I think it is a fundamental difference in government. 
   Social Security--no one would object to the notion we ought to strengthen Social Security. I think everyone would agree with the idea we want Social Security dollars to be safely entrenched. But there are some differences as to how we do that. There is a proposition on the floor that I support--I think it is excellent--that would give a choice to younger people. People over 55 or whatever probably would stay the same, but younger people would have an opportunity to invest or have invested in their behalf a portion of those Social Security dollars in the private sector, in equities. They could choose whether it be in stocks or whether it be in bonds or whether it be in combination. The point being, if we do not do something about Social Security by the time young people who are now beginning to pay in become eligible for benefits, there will not be any, the demographics have changed so much. 
   We started out with over 20 people working for every 1 drawing benefits. Now we have 3 people working for every 1 who draws benefits; it will soon be 2. We have to do something different than what we have been doing in the past. Obviously, you can raise taxes if you choose. That is not a popular idea. You can lower benefits, again not a popular idea. A third alternative is you can increase the return on those dollars that you have paid in and are in the trust account, and that is the difference. 
   There is not agreement on that so we have to choose which way we want to go. 
   I mentioned the Patients' Bill of Rights. Do you want someone in the medical community making a decision instead of your insurance company or do you want to go to court? You get to court, of course, long after the medical decision should have been made. 
   We ought to be doing something to pay down the debt. We talk about paying down the debt, but we do not seem to do much on that. There is a proposition that I think is great, and that is to set aside, as one would with a house mortgage, money and say we are going to pay down so much of this $5 trillion every year and it becomes part of the budget. It makes a lot of sense to me. We find opposition to that because people want to spend the money, and if there is a surplus, they think Government ought to grow and get into many other areas. That is a philosophical difference of opinion. 
   Tax reduction is much the same. When we have a surplus, it seems to me if after having funded the programs that have been authorized, after having done something to strengthen Medicare and having done something to begin to pay down the debt and strengthen Social Security, there is still surplus left, let that go. If we leave it here, it will be spent. It ought to go back to the people who paid in those dollars. 
   Again, it is a different view than those who generally on the other side of the aisle want more Government, more expenditures, and do not agree with that idea. Those are legitimate differences. We have to make a decision, and we have to move forward. We haven't much time to do many of those things. 
   Some of the questions before us are more parochial, more applicable to different parts of the country. I come from a State where 50 percent of the land belongs to the Federal Government, so the management of Federal lands and Federal resources have a great impact on our lives and on our economy. 
   Everyone wants to preserve our resources. They want to take care of the natural resources. Certainly I do. I am chairman of the Parks Subcommittee. There is nothing I care more about than preserving those resources. At the same time, if we are going to do that, we need to have an opportunity for the owners to have access and to enjoy these resources. We also need to have multiple use so we can have hunting, hiking, grazing, and mineral production. 
   Those are the kinds of issues with which we need to deal. The question is, How deeply do we want the Federal Government involved in making all the decisions in our lives? It is a legitimate difference. 
   We are ready to move forward now. Out of 13 appropriations bills, we have completed 2. We have 11 to go. We will be putting together probably one or two bills at a time. I hope we do not come to the end with a huge omnibus package. That is not good governance. I hope we can avoid that. 
   If, for example, we are considering the Interior appropriations bill, I hope we can get away from talking about the Patients' Bill of Rights or minimum wage. Those issues are great issues. We have already dealt with them. We have already voted on them. I think simply to bring them up as a blockage to moving forward with what we have to do is a mistake in 
   governance. I hope we do not do that. 
   I expect the chairman of the Budget Committee to come to the floor shortly and talk a little more about the budget, about the surplus, about the prospects of what we are going to do with those dollars; whether we can, indeed, take 90 percent of this surplus and put it into debt reduction and still have about $27 billion or $28 billion to deal with those issues that need to be strengthened, such as Medicare and Social Security. 
   We have an opportunity to do those things. I am hopeful that each of us as  citizens and voters of this country will take a look at how we see the future role of the Federal Government. 
   We need to deal, obviously, with the military. Defense continues to be a most important item. Most people will agree we have not financially supported the military to the extent it needs to be supported for them to carry out the mission we have assigned. We have made some progress. We have put more money into the military over the last several years, more than the administration has asked for, in fact. We need to continue to do that so we can have a safe United States. 
   I hope we can move forward. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss a little bit of my view of where we ought to go. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to protect two crown jewels of the National Park Service, Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. 
   Specifically, the ``Yellowstone and Teton Scenic Overflight Exclusion Act of 2000'' would prohibit all scenic flights--both fixed wing and helicopter--over these two parks. A recent proposal for scenic helicopter tours near Grand Teton Park has many in this area of Wyoming concerned about the tranquility of Yellowstone and Teton parks. In fact, the proposal has evoked strong opposition by citizens in the area and over 4,500 people have signed a petition in support of banning these tours. 
   We need to protect the resources and values of these parks in the interest of all who visit and enjoy these national treasures--today and for future generations. Every visitor should have the opportunity to enjoy the tranquil sounds of nature unimpaired in these parks. 
   I don't take the idea of legislation lightly. I am aware that the recently passed National Parks Air Tour management Act provides a process that attempts to address scenic overflight operations. But this area of the country is unique and therefore requires quick and decisive action. For example, the proposed commercial air tour operations originate from the Jackson Hole Airport, the only airport in the continental United States that is entirely within a national park. Consequently, every time a commercial air tour operation takes off or lands, it is flying through Grand Teton National Park. Further, commercial air tour operations by their nature fly passengers purposefully over the parks, at low altitudes, at frequent intervals and often to the very locations and attractions favored by ground-based visitors. These threats to the enjoyment of these two parks require banning commercial air tour operations in the area. 
   It is my hope that this legislation can be enacted quickly to ensure the preservation of natural quiet and provide the assurance that visitors can enjoy the sounds of nature at Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I asked for morning business because I am not sure where we are focused, but I want to continue to talk about PNTR, a topic that I hope we are able to conclude shortly. 
   Certainly one of the most important issues we have before us is the issue and the way I come to the conclusion. We all talk about the problems that exist. Obviously, there are problems that exist. I serve as chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs that has dealt over a number of years with the issue of China. I don't think there is a soul here who wouldn't wish things were different there with respect to human rights, some of the issues with respect to proliferation, some of the issues with respect to freedom, and market system changes. I don't think that is the issue. The issue is how we best bring about that change. That is really what it is all about. 
   Do we do it through threats to the PRC? Do we do it with sanctions? I think people have learned quite a bit in seeking to deal with Cuba with sanctions. It has had very little impact and very little effect. I happened to be in Beijing where we were having the great debate over some of the things that were controversial. They canceled a large order with Boeing. What did they do? They bought Airbuses from France. Sanctions don't work. 
   I happen to come from a State where we are very interested in agriculture. So we need to do that. 
   Someone suggested during the course of the discussion over the last couple of days that this bill, if it passed, to grant permanent trade relations would be, in a word, ``rewarding'' China. I don't agree with that. The fact is, we would  be rewarding ourselves with regard to trade. The opening has already been given to China. We are the ones to whom they have agreed, if this happens, to lower tariffs on a number of our things that go there. It really doesn't change the situation much with regard to China. It gives us a better opportunity to do that. 
   We also argue about how we implement these changes. Are we more likely to bring about changes if we are part of a multilateral group such as the WTO or are we more likely to do it with the unilateral kinds of things for ourselves? I happen to believe we would be better off to have an organizational structure such as the WTO to go through to talk about some of the things we think are not being done properly. Does that mean we don't continue to monitor things such as human rights, that we don't continue to monitor things such as weapons proliferation? Of course not. The question really is, Do we go ahead with this bill as it is and at the same time go ahead and monitor the other things as well? 
   I am opposed to the Thompson amendment, which is an amendment to the bill to establish normal trade relations. 
   First of all, as I mentioned, I am chairman of the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over some of these issues. 
   Neither the Foreign Relations Committee nor the Banking Committee has been afforded the opportunity to consider and debate this issue before it was brought to the floor. That is not the customary way to deal with issues that are as far reaching as this one. To bring it to the floor without going through the committees and giving the committees of jurisdiction the opportunity to consider it--the Banking Committee, as you know, which has jurisdiction over a portion of these kinds of arrangements, is very upset about this process. 
   We, of course, argue that under the time constraints it is most difficult. The House passed a bill to open normal trading relations. By the way, the Senate has done it every year for normal trading relationships. This is really a departure from what has been done. But certainly, if we amend it at this time in this session, we will have a difficult time getting it completed. 
   My first problem is jurisdictional, of course. It was introduced by Senator THOMPSON. We had plenty of time and could have done it in May. It could have gone through those committees. But it didn't go to either committee. Certainly the kinds of changes that would be made there would apply. We ought to have that kind of process and not limit the process entirely. The House, of course, has passed this bill by a large majority, and we need to move forward with it. 
   Aside from the jurisdictional concerns, I have a fairly large number of substitute concerns regarding issues of proliferation, and particularly the problem of transfers to Pakistan. I don't believe this amendment will do anything to change the situation. Instead, it would turn us to the discredited, failed strategy of mandatory unilateral sanctions and annual votes on the status of China trade. 
   We have already talked a great deal, of course, about the passage of an amendment and the impact it would have on the relationship. I want to stress again that trying to work with China on some of those things does not make us oblivious to the things on which we disagree with them. Surely, human rights we are going to continue to champion. 
   Again, we have to consider how to best have an influence on bringing about change--change that has not occurred as completely as I would like. I can tell you from my experience that there is change. The more visibility the people of China have to the outside world--the fact of market systems, the fact that personal freedoms provide a much better way of life, it is becoming more and more evident. For years, of course, they have not had any opportunity to see what is going on in the world. For example, things have changed substantially in China. Now they see it. It is important to encourage changes that need to take place. 
   Of course, with respect to another statute that does something about proliferation, we already have numerous statutes available to the President. There is a long list, including the Export-Import Bank Act, the Arms Control Disarmament Act, the Arms Export Control Act, and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. It goes on and on. They provide the very authority that is being talked about in some of these amendments. They are in place. 
   Someone said it gives the President the opportunity to decide and be flexible about it. Then the author--in this case, the Senator from Tennessee--assures Members that this also has a waiver and it gives the President the opportunity to change. We have very little reason to have more legislation in this area. 
   Finally, I vote against this amendment for the same reason I voted against all the amendments that preceded it. I am, along with the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. ROTH, chairman of the Finance Committee, and many others, opposed to adding amendments that will, indeed, have the effect of delaying or killing the PNTR bill. Most any amendments would have that effect. I believe most of the Members of this body also believe that because each of the amendments that have been offered have not survived and have lost by a rather substantial vote. I hope we continue to do that. 
   It is pretty unrealistic while we are trying to complete the work of this Congress to think we can spend another week going back and forth in conference with the House and get this done. 
   I know there are justifiable differences of view. That is what this system is all about. We ought to talk about those. It is my view we have talked about them and there ought to be an end game so we can move on. We keep talking about the things we have to do, including 11 appropriations bills out of 13 that have not yet been passed. Several have not even been marked up. We have less than 3 weeks, 14 days, to work on these. We know very well that the President is going to create some obstacles to the completion of our work so he can have more leverage to get the kinds of spending he wants and put the pressure on the majority party in the Congress. 
   All these things are real and realistic and not unusual. I think we need to understand where we are. I think we need to take a look at the job we do have to do so the American people can continue to be served by those programs that are in the appropriations, that we continue to strengthen education, so we can do something about fairness and tax relief, so that we can move forward in moving some of this money to lower the debt. We ought to continue to work in seeking to get some of the pay back for strengthening Medicare so some of those reductions that have been made can be replaced so we have services in the country. I have particular interest in that as cochairman of the rural caucus for health care. Some of the small hospitals and small clinics need it to happen. We need to move forward and not spend 2 weeks on a repetitious review of the same issues. There comes a time we should move forward. 
   Therefore, I strongly urge we do move forward and that we do not amend the bill before the Senate. Conclude it and send it to a satisfactory signing at the White House and move forward on the issues facing the Senate. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to take a couple of moments. I already mentioned my concerns about the Thompson amendment, but I have to say it is interesting that the Senator is curious as to why there are objections to this amendment. He ought to recall that the Senate has already rejected three or four amendments for the same reason, and that is, we want to send a clean bill to the President. 
   The idea that his is being rejected because of certain things is just not the case. There is a notion here that this bill ought to be sent, right or wrong. I happen to think that he is exactly right. There is also the implication that if you do not agree with this amendment, you do not care about these things. That is not true, either. We do separate things. There are seven or eight bills now in place. 
   The Senator says we are not going to tie the President's hands and then on the other hand says this is going to force the President to do something. We need to get it clear. 
   I wanted to make the point that there is no evidence that people do not care about these things. They do, indeed. There is a belief that these issues ought to be separated and we ought to deal with PNTR and then deal with the other issue. We should not think this is going to cause the President to do a number of things when we already have in place at least seven laws that are not being adhered to. 
   Those are the things on which I wanted to be clear. I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire.

   Mr. THOMAS. I will proceed with PNTR on that basis. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, as chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4444, a bill to establish permanent normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China. 
   Let me begin today by disposing of the principle argument offered by opponents of this bill--that this bill somehow is a ``gift'' to the PRC, a reward. To hear the opponents of this bill talk, you would think that we were on the losing end of this equation. 
   However, examining the basic facts shows there is a fatal flaw in that assertion. Our markets are already open to the Chinese and to Chinese goods; the same is not true about our ability to enter China's markets. This bill, and the accompanying accession of China to the WTO, changes that. This bill opens up their markets to the United States. This bill lowers tariff and nontariff barriers to our goods and services. This bill gives us a level playing field. In other words, it is a win-win situation for the United States. 
   It is estimated that in the first year after this bill is enacted, and China accedes to the WTO, our trade with China will increase by $14 billion; in other words, almost double today's volume. And that translates into more jobs for U.S. workers and U.S. companies. 
   To use my home State of Wyoming, as an example, which is not a large export State, China ranked as Wyoming's 15th largest export destination in 1999; that is up from 16th in 1998 and 19th in 1997. Our largest exports are agricultural products, such as beef, grains, and, in addition to that, minerals. 
   Under this agreement, Wyoming farmers and cattlemen will no longer have to compete with export subsidies China uses to make its agricultural products unfairly competitive. China has agreed to eliminate sanitary requirements which are not based on sound scientific bases and which act as artificial barriers to products from America's Northwest, which includes Wyoming. Wyoming producers will benefit from a broadening of the right to import and distribute imported products in China, and from wide tariff cuts on a wide range of products. 
   To illustrate, under the agreement, China has cut its tariff on beef from 45 percent to 12 percent. It has cut its tariff on pork from 20 percent to 12 percent. And, significantly for a great number of my constituents in Sweetwater County, it will reduce its exorbitant tariffs on soda ash--90 percent of which is mined in Wyoming--from double-digits to 5.5 percent. 
   Passage of this bill means fewer barriers to U.S. exports. Fewer barriers mean more exports, and more exports mean more jobs for Wyoming farmers, ranchers, cattlemen and small business owners. 
   I don't need to tell my colleagues about the present sorry economic state of many of our agricultural sectors and small businesses. The key to their continuing viability and growth is increasing their share of foreign markets. It is for that principal reason that I support this bill and for China to go into the WTO. Clearly, it is going to be more advantageous for us to deal with the People's Republic of China through this organization than on a unilateral basis which we have done for the last number of years. By the way, this same trade arrangement has been available to them on an annual basis. 
   Let me make one more observation before moving on. Defeating the bill will not keep the PRC out of the WTO. China will accede to that body regardless of what we do this week, regardless of whether or not we want it. We don't have a veto over their admission, and we make it sound as if that is the case from time to time. 
   What defeating this bill will do, however, will be to deny us the benefits of an open Chinese market, at least a more open Chinese market. It would allow China to keep its doors closed. It would give our allies and competitors a huge advantage over us. 
   I was there a while back, when we had a feud going on between the United States and China. They canceled large orders from Boeing and bought airbuses from France. That is the way the world has become. They can do that. It would set in stone our present trade regime where 40-percent tariffs are the norm, not the exception. That is what would happen if we don't pass this bill. 
   These are not the only bases for my support. Unlike some of my colleagues, I believe China is changing for the better and that admitting them to the WTO will, hopefully, speed that process. One has only to compare the China of 1978--the China of the Cultural Revolution, of Mao suits, and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong theory--with the China of 2000, the China of the economic revolution, to see that changes are indeed both substantial and widespread.  
   This is not to say that everything is great there. That is not really part of the discussion. Of course, there are a number of things that need to be done. The country continues to have an abysmal human rights record, to stifle political dissent, to subjugate Tibetans, to stridently attempt to cow Taiwan into submission. All these things continue to go on. No one likes that, but that is not really the issue. The issue is how can we best bring about change. 
   There is no argument in this Senate as to whether China needs to change. We all agree it does. I believe the real issue is how do we effectuate that change. Do we do it by continuing to attempt to isolate China, as some Members would have us do, by pushing them away from us, or do we accomplish the task by seeking to engage China, by drawing it further into the community of nations, by giving its people an opportunity to see how others live in the world and then become impatient to make that transformation for themselves? 
   We can see that happening in a number of places around the world. Is it too slow? Sure. Isolating China off by itself is to some a feel-good position, a solution for some people. Improve your human rights record or we will cut off trade. Stop threatening Taiwan or we will cut off military exchanges. Stop selling military hardware to other countries or we will cut off high-tech transfers. Do we want a policy that makes us feel 
   good or do we want something that works? 
   I don't believe you can unilaterally isolate a country such as China. Cut off trade and the European Union is more than happy to step in, sell China Airbuses, as I mentioned, in place of our Boeings. Cut off military-to-military exchanges and we lose the opportunity to impress the PLA with the vast superiority of our military while improving increasing mutual distrust among our two militaries. Cut off high-tech transfers and Beijing simply gets it somewhere else. Add that to the fact that foreign governments rarely react kindly to ultimatums from other governments--take, for example, how we in the U.S. would react to another country if they told us how to manage our affairs--and I believe the unworkability of the ``isolationist solution'' becomes self-apparent. 
   Instead, I believe the best way to influence China is to engage it, to draw it inextricably into the world community, to expose it to the world of ideas. 
   In 1995, on my first trip to China as subcommittee chairman the difference that contacts and trade with the West made in the PRC were clearly evident. I have not traveled there over the years as many people have, but just in the last few years there has been great change. Perfect? Absolutely not. More change is needed, of course. 
   In Beijing, the vast majority of the population was still riding bicycles. There were, 5 years ago, very few private cars, and political questions, especially in Taiwan, and the party line were the sole topic of discussion. In Shanghai, bicycles were replaced by mopeds and more private cars. While Taiwan and ``one China'' were still topics of discussion, individuals I met there were more interested in talking about trade, what they could do to facilitate economic change and growth. In Guangzhou, there were fewer bicycles or mopeds to be seen. Private cars, including BMW and Mercedes Benz, appeared to be the norm. Politics wasn't talked about a great deal. 
   The lesson was quite clear. The establishment of the rudiments of a market economy coupled with trade with the outside world leads to increased personal wealth and to increased personal entrepreneurship. That in turn leads to an increased interest in and expectation of growth and certain basic personal freedoms. We have seen that same development in Taiwan and South Korea where authoritarian governments have been replaced by thriving democracies over the last 20 years. The same hopefully will happen with China. Once the genie is out of the bottle, there is no putting it back. The march toward an open democratic society will happen. The only question is how long it will take. 
   I am told by experts that in Asia it probably takes a generational change before some of those things happen. I am sure that is true. I believe, however, that we do speed its pace by passing this legislation. I also believe that Chinese accession will remove a major irritant in our relationship. Whenever we have a disagreement with China over trade relations, be it intellectual property or market access or whatever, our reaction is to apply some unilateral sanctions on China, sanctions which only serve eventually to limit the rest of our relationship and our exports to that country. It is ineffective here and it has been ineffective other places. We have removed a number of those sanctions this year. 
   By bringing China into the WTO, we turn trade disputes from 
   unilateral into multilateral issues. We transform the dispute from ``I said/he said'' to one mediated by an independent international body. We thereby lessen the irritation of bilateral affairs while at the same time increasing the likelihood that China will find a remedy to the problem. 
   For all those reasons, I support H.R. 4444. 
   Before I close, let me add a word or two about possible amendments which may be offered for consideration. Regardless of their relative merit, I, as Senator ROTH, chairman of the Finance Committee, and many others am strongly opposed to adding any amendments to the China PNTR bill. Any amendment will only have the effect of killing it for this year, since amending would require it to be sent back to the conference committee. Once in conference, it is unlikely the bill would emerge before we adjourn sine die. We only have some 20 legislative days remaining in this session and a full plate of domestic appropriations and legislation with which to deal. It would be a herculean task under any circumstances, but this year makes it more difficult because, of course, some on the other side of the aisle are doing everything they can to stall the process. We hope that won't continue to happen. 
   There is not, realistically, enough time for a conference and to pass it back through both Houses. It is clear the House fully supports the present unamended version. It passed by a vote of 237-197. So does a vast majority of the members of the Senate Finance and Foreign Relations Committees, and so do I. 
   Mr. President, despite all the hyperbole about passage of H.R. 4444, it does not mean we are selling out to the Chinese, that we are telling them it is all right to proliferate, to abuse human rights, or to threaten Taiwan. It means we expect them to play by the same rules we do; we expect them to be a responsible member of the world community, and we expect to be able to reap the same benefits they do from an ever-expanding global economy. No more, no less. The bill is good for the United States, good for U.S. companies, good for U.S. workers, and good for the U.S. consumers. 
   In the final analysis, this is good for China because it will undoubtedly bring about the kind of changes that many would like to see in that country, including many Chinese. Many Chinese would like to see democratization, rule of law, and respect for basic fundamental human rights. 
   For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 4444.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to have a discussion as to where we are going in these remaining, I guess, less than 20 days we have before us. Certainly, we have a great deal to do, as the leader has pointed out. We have 13 appropriations bills and just 2 that have been passed. So we have the responsibility, probably first of all, to deal with that to keep the Government moving forward in doing the kinds of things we must do to ensure that programs in place now are funded. 
   There are a number of other things, of course, that will be talked about, a number of issues each of us, I suppose, have heard a great deal about when we were in our States. I come from a State in which nearly half the land belongs to the Federal Government. So you can imagine a good many of the things I heard about, and I am sure my partner in the Chair heard about, have to do with the public lands issue, the idea of access, multiple use. 
   We, of course, have had the great unfortunate experience during this time of lots of forest fires, which, of course, have been very destructive. We need to take a long look at that, starting, of course, in commending the people who have worked so hard and risked so much to be able to control those fires and have done the very best job that could be done. 
   On the other hand, we have to take a look at the policy that has to do with the control and the management of resources, in this case particularly the management of forests. I submit to you there does need to be management; unless we want nature's way of reducing forests by fire, then we have to do it in some other ways that can be used. So I do hope we will have an opportunity there, of course, to not only take a look at the necessary funding that will be required in order to give the utmost protection to those activities, but also to seek to avoid this kind of repetition in the future. 
   We will be talking, of course, about normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China and additionally, shortly thereafter, WTO entry for Taiwan. I hope both of those things can happen, and happen shortly. We have postponed this activity for a very long time. 
   I think most people understand that if we are going to move forward in today's world, we are going to have to move forward to seek to make some changes in mainland China. The best way to do that is to have some rules laid out for them to be part of a world organization, such as the WTO, and begin to move forward to increase the number of changes that have, indeed, been made there. 
   I think that is very important. It is very important for our economy, but probably more so, it is important for the kinds of things we would like to have take place in China with regard to human rights, with regard to economic freedom, which are things we want to have happen today. So we will be moving forward certainly on that. 
   We will have an opportunity to take another look at tax reductions for the taxpayers of this country in a couple of areas that seem to me to be largely based on fairness. For example, the marriage penalty, it is really very difficult to understand how we can be opposed to making that fair. Two people who are single, if you combine their incomes, are at a certain level, but if they were married, with the same level of income, they would pay more income taxes. That does not seem to be right. Fairness ought to be one of the areas vital to taxation. 
   The same could be applied to the estate tax. As I suggested, our State of Wyoming has lots of small businesses, lots of farm and ranch families who have spent their lives--as did their predecessors--developing these kinds of assets. Under present law, when those assets are subject to the death tax, we find they have to sell those lands in order to make it work out. 
   Mr. President, I sense that you are about ready to rap the gavel, as you should. I just end by saying I hope we can address ourselves to the issues that are out there and not put ourselves off creating issues rather than resolving them. It seems to me that is our challenge. We have the opportunity to do that in the next several weeks. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Idaho, who has been a leader for a very long time in this area--not only on fires, of course, but the management of forests, which is really the issue we will finally have to get to here. I thank him for what he is doing and certainly for the hearings he will have in his committee, which I think will be extremely important and are now extremely appropriate. 
   Wildfires are a very serious thing. They are very scary. They are damaging. They threaten not only the forest itself but, of course, facilities and homes in the forests. I grew up right next to the Shoshone forest next to Cody, WY, between Cody and Yellowstone and, as a matter of fact, participated on two occasions in fighting forest fires. It really is something you can hardly imagine, particularly if you are on a steep mountainside and the forest fire itself releases boulders that roll down. There are lots of scary things about it. 
   As my colleague and most of us know now, wildfires in the West of the United States have ravaged literally  thousands of acres this year, the worst experience we have had in forest fires for a very long time. Hopefully, that is now under control. There has been some change in the weather--snow, as a matter of fact, in some places. There has been some change also in the climate itself. We have had a very dry year in the West which has made it even more difficult. 
   In my home State of Wyoming, we have had thousands of acres devastated. Let me share some of the actual numbers that I think are fairly startling. This is from the National Fire News. The National Interagency Fire Center puts this out from Boise, ID. They have a 13-year comparison of the losses that have taken place as of September 4, for the year 2000. 
   The loss has been 6,566,000 acres this year. This year, of course, is not completed. There are always losses. Last year, in 1999, there were 4.4 million acres burned; the year before, 2 million, and 1 to 2 million has been the more common amount, although in 1996 it was 5.7 million acres that were destroyed. 
   I guess the message is that we know there is going to be some burn. The burn, of course, is the natural way. There are those who argue: Let nature take its course. However, things are not the way they were 300 years ago or 200 years ago. There has to be some kind of different approach. 
   In the States, of course: California, 214,000 acres; in Florida--Florida which is outside the West--183,000; Idaho, being the hardest hit at this point, 1.2 million acres burned in Montana, nearly a million--900,000 acres. New Mexico had almost half a million acres burned. So it has been very devastating. Certainly our first obligation is to fund and do what we can now to stop the fires and to repair the immediate damages. 
   I think it is interesting that in the long term, the total this year is 6.5 million acres burned, and burned for the last 10 years, 2.9 million--less than half. So we have had a very difficult experience this year.

   Mr. THOMAS. I think we need to recognize and thank the people on the ground, the agencies, the firefighters, for all they did. This is tough work. This is dangerous work. So I am very grateful for what has been done. 
   I was out in the midst of it, out in Yellowstone during this last August. Certainly some of the problems were that there were not enough facilities; there were not enough airplanes; there were not enough firefighters; there was not enough equipment to deal with all these things that happened. Again, I am not blaming anyone for that, but it did make it much more difficult. 
   In the appropriations bill with which we are now dealing, I have requested some additional funds for wildlife and fire management this fiscal year. I am very concerned, as the Senator from Idaho pointed out, that in many of these cases--not only firefighters but also maintenance and other kinds of things--this administration has put more emphasis on acquisition and purchase than they have on the management of the resources we have now. I think we need to take a look at that. I am chairman of the parks subcommittee. All of us know there are $4 billion or $5 billion in infrastructure repairs and maintenance needed. But that is not where this administration put the money. 
   This land legacy thing was the one that had the emphasis. So there are some tough questions, I think, certainly not of motives but tough questions in terms of management, as to what our responsibility ought to be. I really am looking forward to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee's oversight hearings when we can take a real, honest look at what we ought to do. 
   What do the roadless areas we are talking about have to do with the ability to control fires? I think it has something to do with it. We have wilderness areas and parks, of course, that are managed differently. It is true that in a wilderness area you are not going to have roads. You have to deal with it another way. Most of these fires are not in the wilderness. If we had access to the fires early on, I think it would be helpful. Certainly harvesting, clearing out the underbrush, clearing out the fuel as it builds up, as it naturally does around mature trees--I have been in some places that are very nearly wilderness, again up around Cody, WY. When selective timbering is done, you go through and you hardly notice it having been harvested. But I tell you, there is much less likelihood of an uncontrollable fire in that area than in the condition in which it had been. 
   Of course, the administration is quick to say it has properly managed the fires. This may not be the case, both from the standpoint of being as prepared financially as we should have been, and, of course, having some management techniques which many of the forest people, many of the people who are actually on the ground, recommend. They know there are things that can be done. 
   I think this is an area we need to talk about. We need to talk about it now. Our focus, of course, has to be on the future and what we can do to limit the kinds of losses in our resources we had this year. I am very pleased to be able to work with my colleagues here, particularly the Senator from Idaho. I am looking forward to doing what we can to be prepared so in the future we will have less of a tragedy than we had this year. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in introducing the ``Rural Health Care in the 21st Century Act.'' I am pleased to have worked with my colleagues in crafting this bill that will address the  needs of rural providers and beneficiaries as we begin the new century. 
   This legislation establishes a grant and loan program to assist rural providers in acquiring the necessary technologies to improve patient safety and meet the continually changing records management requirements. Rural hospitals and other providers do not have the capital needed to purchase these expensive technologies nor the resources to train their staff. This new program will enable these providers to purchase such crucial equipment as patient tracking systems, bar code systems to avoid drug errors and software equipped with artificial intelligence. 
   Another reason this legislation is so important is because it will bring equity to the Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program, which has been inherently biased against rural providers since it was implemented in 1986. The premise of this program is to give hospitals that provide a substantial amount of care to low-income patients additional funding to assist with the higher costs associated with caring for this population. 
   Mr. President, the current DSH program does almost nothing for rural hospitals because different eligibility requirements have been established for rural and urban providers. To qualify for the increased payments the DSH program provides, urban hospitals are required to demonstrate that 15 percent of their patient load consists of Medicaid patients and Medicare patients eligible for Supplemental Security Income. However, rural hospitals must meet a higher threshold of 45 percent. Mr. President, there is no justification for this inequity. Our bill will level the playing field by applying the same eligibility threshold currently enjoyed by urban hospitals to all rural hospitals as well. According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission this reform will open the door for 55 percent of all rural hospitals to benefit from the DSH program--a significant increase over the 15.6 percent of rural hospitals currently participating. 
   The ``Rural Health Care in the 21st Century Act'' also addresses other inequities faced by rural providers because federal regulators do not adequately reflect the unique circumstances of delivering health care in rural America. This bill provides rural home health agencies with a 10 percent bonus payment as they have average per episode costs that are 20 percent higher than urban agencies. 
   Rural Health Clinics and Critical Access Hospitals are a key component of maintaining access to primary and emergency services in rural communities. This legislation makes modifications to the Balanced Budget Act to ensure these providers will continue to be an integral part of the rural health care delivery system. 
   Mr. President, I believe this bill is an important step in ensuring rural providers are treated equally under federal programs. This equalization must be accomplished so we can guarantee that rural Medicare beneficiaries have the same choices and access to services as their urban counterparts.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to take a minute today to react to the news that has been all over, of course, in the last few days about the selection of a Wyoming person to be on the ticket with Governor Bush. We are very excited, of course, and very proud of Dick Cheney. We think he is certainly a great addition to anyone's ticket for national governance. We think he is a great choice. 
   Mr. Cheney, of course, was most recently Secretary of Defense. He moved to Secretary of Defense from serving Wyoming for nearly 10 years in the Congress, in the House. I was fortunate enough to be able to replace Dick Cheney in the House, representing Wyoming, so I, of course, have followed his career closely. No one was more excited than I was when he left to go to Defense. In any event, not only that but of course he had worked in the White House. He had worked there as an administrative person, finally worked his way up to be Chief of Staff for President Ford.  
   So really there is no one who has had a broader and better experience in National Government than Dick Cheney. Perhaps even more important than that, this is a person who is a real person. I am sure all of us get a little exasperated from time to time in politics, where it seems almost everything is spinning the issue, particularly in election times. You hear things. Someone asks a question and the question is never answered because they spin off into something that is entirely different to be advantageous to themselves. Not Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney is a guy who is real. He is a guy just like the rest of us. He grew up in Caspar, WY; went to school there. So all of us, including the Presiding Officer here, from Wyoming, are very proud of Dick Cheney and very pleased that he will be a part of this campaign, hopefully of governance in this country. 
   Finally, for a couple of seconds I would like to say how disappointed I am that we are not moving forward, doing the business of the people of this country. We are down to where there are 4 days left this week, less than that, actually--a week when we had hoped to do, probably, three appropriations bills. We go out, then, in August for recess, come back in September, probably have less than 20 working days to accomplish the business of this country. 
   Whether you like it or not, one of the major features of the Government is the appropriations process. It is determining what money is spent for, what programs are given priorities. Of course, that is what the appropriations process is all about. We are talking about $1.8 trillion, almost $700 billion of that being in appropriated funds. So our responsibility is to do that. Now we find ourselves being held up from going forward. I understand there are differences of opinion. That is what this is all about. There are supposed to be differences of opinion. But there is also a way to deal with those without holding up the progress of the entire Congress and ignoring the things we are designed to do, often simply to make an issue. 
   We find ourselves, unfortunately, in Presidential years more interested in creating issues than we are in creating solutions. I think that is too bad. Obviously, issues are important. Obviously, differences of view are important. Obviously, there is generally a considerable amount of difference between the views on the other side of the aisle, the minority, and the majority. The minority, of course, is generally for spending more money, having more Government. They 
   see the role of the Federal Government expanded greatly, where most of us on this side are more interested in holding down the size of government, moving government closer to the people and the States and in the counties and that sort of activity. 
   It is discouraging when they use that leverage of basically shutting down the things we must do. Unfortunately, there is a history of that. In 1998, in the second session, the minority held up the education savings account, the protection of private property rights, product liability reform, NATO expansion, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act, funding for the Treasury Department--all in the effort to use that leverage. 
   Last year, of course, we had the obstruction of the Social Security lockbox--six times. We would go back to the same six times to make an issue out of it. Ed-Flex, the idea of giving more flexibility to education and letting people on the ground, in the States and on the school boards, have more determination as to what was done there, and bankruptcy reform--still in limbo. 
   We had delay in such critical issues as the elementary-secondary education bill. That is something that ought to be moved. Marriage penalty tax relief--it took a very long time. You can make decisions on things, but to try to change it by avoiding moving forward is a very destructive kind of operation. That is where we find ourselves right now, unfortunately. 
   The Ed-Flex bill, as I said, had to have five votes before we could break that. The lockbox legislation to protect Social Security, we went over and over that. 
   Much of it is the idea somehow if we can put everything off until after the first of the year, there will perhaps be another opportunity to do something different. 
   I think it is time for us to adjourn. I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his comments and his very strong feelings about friends, people with whom he has worked. 
   I had a little different experience, I guess, with Paul Coverdell in that he was here when I came. So I was not in this business of leadership with him. Indeed, he took time to spend time with those of us who were new and to say: How can I help you? How can we work together? This was the kind of man that Paul Coverdell was. Certainly, he was an image that each of us should seek to perpetuate--that of caring, that of really feeling strongly about issues, and then, of course, being willing to do something about it. So I want to share with the leader my sorrow and sadness in not having Paul Coverdell here with us. I extend our condolences to his family.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to take some time today to talk about some of the things we are doing, some of the goals I hope we have, and the position we find ourselves in now as we come down to the last week prior to the August recess. 
   When we come back from the August recess, we will have, I suppose, about 20 working days to finish this 2-year session of Congress, the 106th session. We will have a great deal to do. As we go forward, as we take a look at the day-to-day tasks and activities that we have before us, I hope always that we look at where we want to go and what the goals are. 
   Sometimes I feel as if we get wrapped up in the day-to-day operations and the day-to-day problems and we lose sight  of where it is we want to be. But overall, as a Member of the Senate, or as an American citizen who is interested in Government, and as a voter, it seems to me that we ought to look at where we want to be over a period of time. Many things are involved, of course, in that. I think we have to take a look at where we are with respect to the Constitution. Most of us believe this Constitution has given us the greatest country in the world. This Constitution has given us more freedom, more opportunity, and more privileges than anywhere else in the world. Are we continuing to support that Constitution? Where will we be in 50 years? Where will we be in 10 years? 
   With regard to the role of the Federal Government, where do we want to be? What is our goal in terms of the future? What is the role of the Federal Government with regard to individual freedoms? What is the role of the Federal Government with respect to local government--the States and counties? Do we want a Federal Government that dominates all the things that we 
   do? I don't believe so. So as we do each of these steps, it seems to me that it is appropriate to try to evaluate a little what we are doing and how that contributes to where we want to go. I know it is difficult. I think it is a challenge for each of us as we go about what we are doing. 
   I am, frankly, proud of what we have been able to do in this session. I am pleased about the direction the majority in the Senate has taken with regard to many of the issues; with regard to the balanced budget; with regard to Social Security; with regard to spending as it reflects Social Security and the changes that we have made to stabilize Social Security, making it strong; what we have done in terms of education; where we are in terms of the military and the security of this country, which is probably the No. 1 responsibility of the Federal Government. 
   So I think we ought to look at where we are. We are close now to finishing up. We have a number of things to do. But our determination, I believe, should be to stay within the budget we established. We have a budget program in which early this year we established spending limitations that we wanted to live within. It is difficult to do that. Everyone has a good idea as to where we can spend money. There are thousands of opportunities to spend money. 
   Frankly, when you have a surplus, spending becomes easier; it becomes something that everybody sort of gets into doing. We a have balanced budget. We maintain Social Security without spending Social Security dollars. We have been working on strengthening Medicare and pharmaceuticals, and we must continue to do that. We need to set up the technique for paying down the debt that we ought to pay. We have an obligation to pay that so our children don't have to. We are dedicated to returning the surplus back to the taxpayers, the people who have paid in the dollars. The surplus, indeed, should go back to them. 
   So it seems to me that we have a principle in our party, in this majority of the Senate, and in the Senate generally, for fiscal responsibility, for preserving Social Security, tax relief, and education. I am very proud of what we have done. 
   With regard to balancing the budget, actually in the last several years--it is the first time since the Eisenhower administration in 1957 that we balanced the budget with funds outside of Social Security. As the money comes in, of course, it comes in a unified budget. Social Security money has been borrowed and spent on programs other than Social Security. In 1995, when the Republicans took control of Congress, for the first time in 42 years, we began to balance the budget. I am pretty proud of that. I hope that we continue to be. 
   In terms of Social Security, of course, the first obligation is to set aside those dollars so that they are not spent on something else. Under our system, all that we can do with Social Security dollars is to put them into the trust fund, a Federal investment, which yields a relatively low return. We are seeking to take a portion of the Social Security funds now and let that account belong to the individual, so that when young people take their first job and have 12.5 percent of their earnings set aside, a portion of that can be in an account that belongs to them, which can be invested in the private sector at their direction, which can return a much higher yield so that over time there will be benefits for young people, 
   probably leaving the ones 55 and older not doing anything at all and making sure they stay as they are. 
   Young people years from now will not have a return unless they do something different. We could increase taxes. Nobody is much interested in that. We could reduce benefits. That is not an answer. But we can increase the return on the trust funds. We are doing that. 
   We are funding education at a higher level than before, at a higher level than the administration requested. But probably more important is the effort made to return the decisions made with regard to elementary and secondary education back to the schools--closer to the school districts and closer to the school boards, rather than having those decisions being made in Washington. I can tell you that the needs in Pine Bluffs, WY, are much different from those in Pittsburgh. 
   You have to have some flexibility. We have the Ed-Flex bill so that those kinds of decisions can be made. I am pretty proud of that. I am very pleased with that. As the leader said, Senator Coverdell was the leader in doing those kinds of things. 
   As for strengthening the military, we are finding ourselves, of course, at a time when we don't have the cold war, where the inclination is for the emphasis to be off the military. This is not a simple world. We find ourselves at times needing a strong defense. We have a voluntary military, which we should have. But you have to make it relatively attractive for people to go into the military and stay there. You bring people into the military and train them to be pilots and mechanics; then they leave. We have done something there. We have increased the appropriations. We have increased, hopefully, the pay. Of course, if you are going to have an up-to-date military, there has to be science moving forward in new weaponry. We have to have new weapons. It is most difficult to do that. 
   This weekend I visited the Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, WY, one of the major bases. It is really one of the stable portions of our defense. We have to support that, of course. 
   Health care, naturally, is one of the things that is most important. We have moved to improve some of the payments that were made. We made some reductions in the balanced budget amendment in 1996. However, the administration has made those even larger than was intended. We have to go back and reclaim some of those payments--particularly for outpatient care and hospitals. 
   These are the things the majority party has worked toward and continues to work on. 
   We find ourselves now in the appropriations process. There are 13 appropriations bills to be passed. Hopefully, we will get 11 of them passed by the time this week is over. But it is very difficult. We have to challenge the administration. If they don't get their way--if they don't get the money they want in a particular appropriations--they are going to veto it. The President has threatened to shut down the Government, as he did before, and blame the Congress, of course. We have to keep that from happening. Nobody wants to shut down the Federal Government. We have different points of view. We have a different philosophy. 
   That is what this is all about. We debate those philosophies. Some people think government ought to be involved in all of life's activities. Others think there is no end to 
   the amount of abuses that can take place. Others believe there ought to be some limit on the rules of the Federal Government. After we strengthen Medicare and pay down the debt, we ought to return additional money to those people who have made the payments. 
   With regard to paying down the debt, I am hopeful we can consider the proposition of a plan to do that. Again, our goal is to pay off the national debt of $6 trillion. It seems to me we ought to do it in an organized way--do it a little as a mortgage where you decide every year you are going to pay off some on the debt--and move toward doing that. If you keep saying, we will pay it down one of these days, it never happens. The interest on that debt becomes one of the largest items in the budget. We can fix that if we are willing to do it.  
   I am very proud of what we have accomplished in this Congress. I think we have established a philosophy and a direction of providing adequate programs for controlling the size and growth of expenditures of the Federal Government; doing those things that are necessary, yet moving many decisions back closer to the people and the local governments; taking care of the obligations we have, such as paying down the debt and returning those dollars. 
   One of the real controversies, of course, is going to be the tax relief that passed the Senate. The tax relief is in two areas that seem to be particularly appropriate--the marriage penalty tax, where two people who are working for x amount of dollars get married, continue to make the same amount of dollars, and then pay more taxes. It is a fairness issue. There is something wrong with that. We have changed that. The President has threatened to veto it. 
   The other one that needs to be changed, in my opinion--and the Presiding Officer has been a leader in this--is the death tax, the estate tax, the idea that when someone dies, up to 50 percent of their earnings throughout their life can be taken by the Federal Government. 
   The alternative, of course, is to not let death be a trigger for taxes but, rather, let those moneys be passed on to whomever they wish to pass them on to, and whenever things are disposed of and sold, there is a capital gains tax, of course, on the growth that has taken place. It seems to me that is a fairness issue. 
   That is where we are. Those are some of the exciting things that I think are happening, and things that fit in, I believe, with the goals most of us have in terms of moving forward with this Federal Government. 
   We now have a fairly short time to continue doing what has to be done. Appropriations have to be done. We need to continue with our tax reductions and continue with strengthening education. We need to continue in health care. We are on the road to doing that. I am very pleased with how we are doing it. 
   I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, in the last part of our time here I want to follow up a little bit on your comments about the prospects for the Vice Presidential nomination for Dick Cheney. Partly, I guess, that is because it is a personal thing. As you mentioned, Dick Cheney is from Wyoming. Indeed, he is still a resident and now I understand he is voting in Wyoming. Certainly he is a friend. As a matter of fact, I took Dick Cheney's place in the House when he took the job as Secretary of Defense. I was more delighted about his promotion than anyone else, I suppose. 
   Aside from that, I guess I am really impressed with the opportunities that might bring about. Of course, it is up to the Governor, Governor Bush, to do whatever he chooses. He has not yet made an announcement. But it seems to me it is satisfying to think of someone being on that ticket who is just a basic person, who has demonstrated his ability to do so many things in government and outside of government. I think it is kind of unusual in today's political scene for it to be someone who just says it like it is, not the great spin. 
   I was thinking about that yesterday. I was hearing some things on the radio, trying to make one thing sound like another. That is not the way Dick Cheney does things. He just says it. 
   He has a great background in government. He worked in the White House, was Chief of Staff. By the way, I saw him at the airport in Denver. He seems to be doing well. Of course, he was in the House of Representatives, I think, for six terms--a number of terms, anyway. He rose to leadership there. He was selected then, as you know, to be Secretary of Defense. He did a super job in the gulf war and the activities there. 
   So it just seems to me he would bring to anyone's ticket this ideal of a strong, stable person, knowledgeable, ready to move in and do the kinds of things that are required of the leadership of this country. 
   I guess I am a cheerleader for Dick Cheney. Hopefully, we will have a chance to continue to do that over the next several months. 
   Mr. President, our time is nearly expired. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to talk on this issue. It is an important issue to this country; it is an important issue to my State. 
   I suspect much of what I state may have perhaps already been said. Nevertheless, I think it is important that we take a continuing look at the facts of the issue. We have heard a lot of emotional discussion with respect to it. The fact is, we have been through this before. About every year we seem to go through the same discussion. 
   It does impact many people. It is not something where just a few rich people are involved. It provides 420,000 jobs in 40 States. Many agriculture communities are dependent on sugar production, as are some in my State. Frankly, it is one of the few products that is processed on to retail use. It comes out of the State ready to put on the grocery store shelf. Seldom does that happen in my State. 
   It provides a $26 billion annual economic activity and is a very high quality product, one that is changing. We  talked about the candy and so on. Most of that comes from corn sweeteners. Nevertheless, it is very important. It is a very efficient industry; by world standards, we have the 18th lowest cost of production out of 96 producing countries, despite the fact that we have high-cost environmental standards and those kinds of costs. 
   As the Senator from North Dakota made quite clear, we keep talking about the ``world'' price. It isn't the world price. It is the dump price. Almost all the countries are subsidized. After they raise more than the subsidy applies to, it is dumped on the market. That needs to be understood. 
   We need to understand that consumers have benefited from this program. Retail sugar prices are virtually unchanged since 1990 and are 20 percent below the developed country average. It is about the most affordable in the entire world, as a matter of fact. 
   We have talked about taxpayer benefits. Until this year, the sugar program has been a zero cost program for 15 years, since 1985. It generated $279 million in revenue since 1991 that was paid by the industry into the Government. It is WTO, NAFTA compliant. Prices have been very low for the producers, very low in the industry. 
   Unfortunately, there has not been a passthrough. What we find is the grocery stores have not lowered their price. The price of sweetened products is up 7 to 9 percent. At the same time, the grower price has been down approximately 20 percent. We find a great deal of activity there. 
   We have heard several times about the GAO report. The Senator talked about that. Certainly, the findings of USDA were such that they confused the world market with the dump price, as was pointed out. They also assumed that the lower costs were being passed on 100 percent through the retail market. That is not the case. Even though I am a great supporter of GAO, that study was not one that has been particularly useful. 
   The wholesale price for refined sugar has been down, is down, 25.9 percent in the last 3 1/2 years. At the same time, the price for refined retail sugar is about the same. Ice cream is up. Candy is up. Cookies are up. Cereal is up. We haven't seen that pass through to the product. 
   I will not continue to go through this. I think we have covered many of the facts. This is a very important industry in 
   my State. Our sugar beet production is one of the most efficient in the world. We have three refineries. It is very important to us. We have been through this whole discussion before. I think we agreed, then, this is an important matter to the country, to agriculture. I rise in opposition to the amendment of the Senator from Arizona.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about an issue that is very important to many people. It is certainly important to me as chairman of the parks subcommittee in the Senate and as a supporter of parks. Having grown up right outside of Yellowstone Park, the parks there are very much a part of our lives. 
   Let me quickly summarize what this amendment does. I can do it very quickly because it is quite simple. It deals with the idea and the concept of having access to national parks, when it is appropriate, for the use of individual snow machines--something we have done for some 20 years--frankly, without any particular objection until this last year, and without any real evidence that we can't make some changes that would allow us to continue to do that. 
   Unfortunately, rather than looking for an opportunity to bring about some changes in the machines, or some changes in the way they are used, or to manage the way they are used, this administration has simply said: We are going to bring about a regulation unilaterally that will eliminate the use of snow machines in the parks of the United States. 
   What this amendment does, simply, is provide some money--$400,000; and we have found a place to get that money--to conduct a study to determine how the national parks can do a couple of things: One, minimize the potential impact of snow machines and properly manage competing recreational activities in the National Park System. That is pretty logical stuff. In fact, you can almost ask yourself, haven't they done this? The answer is that they have not. Two, properly manage competing recreational activities in units of the national park. Again, that is pretty easy to do. In Yellowstone Park, where there is a great demand for using snow machines, on the one hand, and cross-country skiing, on the other, with management you can separate these two so that they are not conflicting uses. Of course, that requires some management. 
   So then the second part of it is that no funds may be appropriated until such time, basically, as the Park Service has completed their study and submitted it back to the Committee on Appropriations in the House of Representatives and the Committee on Appropriations in the Senate. So this doesn't put any long-time restriction on what can be done. It simply says: Here is some money; take a look at where we are, what the problems are, and what we can do about them, and bring that back and make some management decisions. It is fairly simple and, I think, fairly reasonable. That is what this amendment is all about.  
   I guess the real issue comes about due to the fact that we have had a considerable amount of activity. What really brings it about is a winter use study that is going on now in Yellowstone and the Teton Parks. It has to do with the broad aspect of winter use and with buffalo moving out of the park and what kinds of things can be done there; and how people can get in and out of the parks and utilize them in the wintertime, which really brought about this whole thing. The Assistant Secretary of the Interior went out to look and came back with an idea--I think mostly of his own--that we ought to do away with snowmobile use. He did this without having any facts, science, or looking at what could be done so that you could be consistent with the purpose of the park. 
   The purpose of a park is basically to maintain the resource and to maintain it in such a way that its owners can enjoy the 
   use of it. Those things are not inconsistent. Those things are not inconsistent with snowmobiles, in my judgment. But whether it is my judgment or not, more importantly, the idea to come to the conclusion that they are inconsistent without any facts is something we ought not to accept. 
   I am a little surprised that someone in this Congress would rise to defend the authority of the executive branch to go around the Congress and to do something without even including the Congress or the people. That is not the way this place is set up. That is not what we are here for. That is why we have a division between the executive and the legislative and the judicial--a very important division. It is, frankly, being ignored by this administration not only on this issue but on many of them. They are overtly saying: If we don't get approval, we will just do it. That is not the way things are supposed to happen. 
   I am also a little surprised, frankly, that a representative of a public lands State would be interested in having the agencies that manage--in the case of Nevada--nearly 90 percent of the land and, in Wyoming, over half, making decisions without involving some of the people who should be involved, who are involved with living in these areas. 
   I think we are really talking about a system of rulemaking--a system of regulation--and one that needs to be based on facts and based on the idea that you take a look at issues. Frankly, the substantial amount of evidence about what has been said about snowmobiles in west Yellowstone and other places simply isn't factual. I could go through all of that stuff, but I will not. But it is terribly important that we try to do things based on real facts. 
   The Department of Interior has announced that it intends to ban snowmobiles in all but 12 of about 30 parks--not all in the West, as a matter of fact. We sent a letter to the Secretary of the Interior some time ago with 12 signatures on it. They quickly came to the Senate from Maine, from Minnesota, from the west coast, and some from the Rocky Mountains. It is not only in the area that has limited interest; it has interest from all over the whole country. 
   The Department claims that only a complete ban to curb snowmobiles on issues and noise will protect the wildlife. That simply isn't the only alternative that is available. 
   I want to make it very clear that it is not my position, nor would I defend the notion that snowmobiles ought to continue to be used as they are currently being used. They can be changed substantially. We have had meetings with the manufacturers, which, by the way, have a very strong presence in Minnesota. Lots of jobs and lots of issues are involved. Jobs isn't really the issue. The issue is access to the land that belongs to the people of this country, but they can be changed. 
   One of the things that has not happened and that should 
   happen is there ought to have been some standard established for snowmobiles, saying here is the level of emissions that is acceptable, and here is the level of noise that is acceptable. If you want to use your machine in the park, you have to have one that complies with these regulations. There have been none. 
   The same thing could be said about where you use the machine. If you are going to be in the same track as deer, it doesn't need to be that way. 
   We have had failure on the part of management of the Park Service to do something to make these kinds of uses compatible with the purposes of the parks. Rather than do that, or rather than making efforts to do that, they simply say, no. They are just going to cut it out; they aren't going to do that. 
   I object to that process. I don't think that is the kind of process that we ought to look forward to in this country--whether it is snowmobiles, or water, or whether it is automobiles, or whether it is food regulations, or whatever. We have to have something better. Interior has never considered a single management scheme to be able to make it better. 
   Certainly I hear all the time: Well, the snow machine people should have done something better. Maybe so. I don't argue with that. However, if you were a developer of snow machines, if you were a manufacturer and you were going to invest a good deal of money to make changes in them, I think it would be important to you to know what the standard is going to be so you are able to meet those requirements and continue to be able to put out the machine that would comply. 
   We have had hearings. We have met with those manufacturers. They testified they can and will produce and market the machine, if EPA will set the standard. 
   It is kind of interesting that most of the parks, such as Yellowstone, are full of cars, buses, and all kinds of things in the summertime which do not seem to have an impact here. But in the wintertime, it seems that something much less in terms of numbers is what we are going to cut off. 
   I want to deal largely with the concept that we ought to really pay attention to the purpose of these resources--to make them available, to have access to them, that we need to have a system that is based on findings of fact and science, and be able to come up with alternatives rather than simply making the bureaucrat decision downtown that we are going to do away with this or we are going to do away with that. 
   We ought to put into effect a time that this agency can study this issue, look at the alternatives, provide some money to do that, have them bring their findings back, and then certainly make some choices. 
   This amendment is simple and straightforward. I think that is better than the bureaucratic approach of just deciding somewhere in the bowels of the Interior Department we are going to do something. 
   I find a great deal of reaction to it in my State, of course, and the surrounding States which are very much impacted. 
   This is not a partisan issue. I have worked with the majority leader and the Senator from Montana to try to find a solution. We are looking for solutions. That is really what we need some time to be able to do.

The idea that there is not an opportunity to offer amendments in limited debate is not a very valid argument. That is because that side has not agreed.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this is an interesting debate. It has gone on now for a substantial amount of time. We talked about all of the details. Of course, that is a proper thing to do. There are all kinds of ideas in the Senate, which is the way it is supposed to be. That is what the Senate is about. 
   There are many, particularly on that side of the aisle, who want to spend more--that more spending is the better thing to do. There are others who believe there should be a limit on spending--a limit on what the Federal Government does. But that is a judgment we need to make. Some apparently think that it is better to penalize spending, to make it more difficult for people to amass money. Others believe we ought to encourage savings. That is what the system is about. It causes people to be able to work and save for themselves. 
   There are some who believe we ought to be in the business of redistributing income. Of course, we are dealing with that all of the time. Others believe we ought to encourage enterprise and entrepreneurship. 
   These differences, philosophical and others, are as they should be. It is the role of the Senate to do that. It is also the obligation and role of the Senate to come to closure. 
   The idea that we drag these things along is exasperating. We have 35 days left in this session to finish many things, including the very important appropriations bills. As we move toward the end, of course, we have an administration that is interested, as always, in shutting down the Government and blaming the Congress so they get all the appropriation things they choose. 
   The House adopted this bill by a vote of 279-136, which is greater than a two-thirds majority. This estate repeal, this death tax repeal, over a 10-year period, does away with the death tax. It takes death out of the formula. It would not eliminate taxes. Those properties and values passed on to someone else will be a basis, and when and if those are disposed of, there will be a tax on them. It isn't a matter of not taxing them; it takes death out of the proposition. 
   Interestingly enough, despite all the concerns about revenue impacts, the tax raises only 1 to 2 percent of overall Federal revenues. That is relatively small. As a matter of fact, the Joint Economic Committee indicated a probable loss of income taxes because of businesses that have to be shut down as  a result of estate taxes, thus causing a deficit. 
   This idea that we will eliminate taxes, that people don't pay taxes on the property, isn't true. They will be paid on the basis of whenever they are disposed of. 
   There are a number of things that need to be dealt with. One is that the death tax kills jobs. No question about that. Many small businesses and farms have to sell their properties. Jobs are eliminated. Those people who lose their jobs are taxed at 100 percent. I happen to be from the West where we are interested in keeping open space. Agriculture does that. Many agriculturists will have to sell their lands when they have to pay this estate tax. It will be developed. It ruins that idea. 
   Certainly double taxation is involved here, so there are some philosophical issues that we ought to take into account. Again, I will stay away from the details. We have had a great deal of talk about the details. 
   Instead of talking about the fact that we have lots of money, there are a million things for which we can spend it. We have had more difficulty holding down the size of the Federal Government, and that is more important when we have a surplus than when we have a deficit because there are a million things for which we can spend it. We ought to talk about what is the legitimate role of the Federal Government; what is the role of State and local governments. 
   Do we just involve ourselves in everything because there is money available? I don't think so. We have a constitutional government, a constitutional limitation. We ought to talk about that. We ought to talk about saving Social Security. We are doing that. We ought to talk about strengthening health care. We are doing that. We ought to pay down some of the debt. And then, frankly, we talk about taxes. Money ought to go back to the people who own it, who are paying in. Fairness ought to be a part of this whole equation. I hope it will be. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that deals with a program called Payment In Lieu of Taxes. Last year there was an appropriation of approximately $135 million. This year we intended to increase that amount. We have a letter that came from 57 of our colleagues urging an increase. We have changed the amendment to where it would be an increase in funding over the proposal by $3 million, bringing it up to $148 million. 
   This is substantially below what the authorizations are. However, I do understand the difficulty of the funding. I appreciate the opportunity to work with the chairman and the ranking member. 
   Basically what this does, of course, is provide payments to the States for the public lands that are owned there, public lands that if they were privately owned would be taxed and would be an income source. 
   These counties, despite the fact there is no taxable income, continue to carry on their services--lease services, hospital services, other kinds of services. So really it is sort of a fairness issue when the Federal Government has substantial amounts of ownership. 
   In Wyoming, 50 percent of the State belongs to the Federal Government. We have counties that run as high as 96 percent being federally owned lands and many that are over half. So this is sort of a payment to them. The Nation, of course, benefits from this ownership, but the counties have to pay the ticket. 
   I will not go into great detail. But I urge this amendment be agreed to.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I won't take a long time. My friends have covered many of the details. 
   This issue is not about the pictures that were shown by the Senator from Illinois. It has nothing to do with overgrazing or not overgrazing. That is not the issue. I hate to see it be left that way because it really has nothing to do with that. It has to do with what happens until the BLM can get to that piece of land to make the study to decide what to do with the lease. It is pretty simple. 
   Here is what it says:  
   The terms and conditions contained in the expiring permit or lease shall continue in effect under the new permit or lease until such time as the Secretary of Interior completes the processing of such permit or lease in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, at which time such permit may be canceled, suspended or modified, in whole or in part, to meet the requirements of such applicable laws and regulations. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to alter the Secretary's statutory authority.  
   I am sorry to say that doesn't fit much with what the Senator from Illinois described when he discussed this bill. I do think we need to briefly talk about what does it do. 
   It allows the BLM to have more time to complete the necessary environmental reviews for renewing permits and leases. By providing BLM more time, they are less susceptible to litigation and therefore less costly to the taxpayer, and it is more likely that BLM will not rush to finish their job and do a complete job of their review when the time comes. The language provides a better method for stewardship of Federal lands by having the BLM and the rancher work hand in hand on it. It provides the means for the agency to utilize sound processes and procedures. That is what they claim they have not had time to do. This provides that. 
   It subjects the permittee or lessee to potential modifications by the BLM of the terms and conditions, once the reviews are completed. It doesn't give them carte blanche. BLM is still able to revoke a permittee's grazing privileges at any time. They can do that. 
   It provides more stability, consistency, and security to ranching families. That is very important to us. Fifty percent of Wyoming belongs to the Federal Government. Most of that is BLM land. It is multiple-use land; it was designed to be under the law. This is a renewable resource, and it is done that way. I know that doesn't mean much in Chicago, but it means an awful lot in Wyoming, out where the Federal lands are. We have to talk about that. 
   The language eases the end-of-the-year backlog, of course, for BLM. 
   What does the language not do? It does not lessen the responsibility of the rancher in abiding by the terms and conditions of the permit or lease. It does not limit BLM's authority to manage grazing on public lands. It does not exempt the permittee or the lessee from any environmental law. It does not grant a permit in perpetuity. It simply provides for 10 years, until it is changed by the BLM. 
   It does not allow BLM to delay or ignore compliance of any environmental law or regulation, since BLM is mandated in those time lines to do those things. 
   Why is this language necessary? Frankly, it is very disappointing that the Senator from Illinois is back the second year in a row to fight against western livestock ranchers. This issue--BLM not being able to complete the required environmental renewal process on expiring grazing permits--is not the permittee's fault. The backlog was created by the administration, 
   by the BLM. For some reason or other, the Senator from Illinois prefers to penalize the ranchers rather than hold the agency accountable. 
   Striking this section in the bill is really detrimental to management of these lands. The Senate language, which I agree with, states:   
   The inability on the part of the Federal Government to accomplish permit renewal procedural requirements should not prevent or interrupt ongoing grazing activities on public land.  
   When they get back to doing their job, it continues on. It is pretty simple. It has worked. It can work in the future. I think it is important we have the same language President Clinton signed into law last year. 
   As a matter of fact, after being contacted by the cattlemen, he said:  
   ..... the final 2000 budget does provide BLM with $2.5 million that will enable the agency to effectively conduct detailed reviews before renewing livestock grazing permits and leases to ensure environmental compliance. I am confident this funding will help us protect both the public lands and the livelihood of hardworking ranchers.  
   That was from President Clinton's letter. 
   That is where we are. What we need to do is vote against this amendment and allow the system to continue to work as we proved it can work last year. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I take a few minutes to comment on the bill and some of the areas of particular concern. 
   First, I recognize and thank the chairman and Senator BYRD for their good work. It is a tough job on any appropriations bill to hold down spending and keep it within the budget. Yet it is very difficult to set the priorities. This is one of the hardest jobs in the Congress. I appreciate the work they have done. 
   Particularly in this Interior bill, it is very hard to put together a bill that gets support throughout the entire Congress, representing all the States in the country, when a large part of the activity goes on, of course, in the public land States. 
   I want to comment on a few of those areas that are of particular concern to those who live in the West, where much of the State is owned by the Federal Government, ranging from 25 to nearly 90 percent of some States belonging to the Federal Government. Our economy, our future, all those things are tied very closely to what happens with the management of Federal lands. Much of that is within this budget of Interior. 
   I am particularly pleased, as chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, that the funding for national parks is in this budget, as well. 
   Certainly we would all like to see as much support as possible for parks, but there is an increase here, as there has been over the past several years. There are some 379 parks in this country, national parks, all of which are quite different--from Yellowstone to the Statue of Liberty--parks that are unique. 
   The idea, of course, is to have the basic support for parks come from appropriations. We have developed over the past several years some alternative support, supplemental sources of funding that are not meant to replace, of course, but simply to supplement. These are such things as demonstration fees, which are then used in the park in which they are collected, or highway funds which come from the highways and go to the parks. I am thinking particularly in this case of Yellowstone Park, where highways are a very important part of their funding. Much of that goes there. We encourage contributions that can be made from the private sector. 
   There are several areas of concern, of course. One of them is PILT--payment in lieu of taxes. This is a program designed for a county where much of the land is owned by the Federal Government, where they would normally have real estate taxes that would come in through the operations of the county. Of course, when the Federal Government owns the land, those taxes are not collected and therefore this is a replacement and one that has been there for a very long time. It is quite important. It is very important because, in most cases, the counties provide the kinds of services on the public lands that they would provide on the private lands, even though the Federal Government, by its nature, does not pay the taxes. So these are payments that are made in lieu of. 
   There are some increases in this budget over the last year, but not nearly equal to the taxes that would be collected if the Federal Government did not own the land. So to the extent that is some measurement of fairness, then we are still quite below where we ought to be in the PILT area. We raised the authorization a number of years ago. Now it is tied to some kind of growth in the economy. We are, of course, quite below what the authorized level would be. We have some increases. We would like to have some consideration given to them. 
   Large amounts of land in Wyoming belong to the Federal Government--in the entire West. It creates some responsibility. Last week I met with county commissioners in Big Horn, WY, and their primary concern was what we are going to do with PILT because much of their county is Federal land. We have a unique relationship with the Federal Government. The Government depends on local communities to provide this infrastructure. Without the support of these counties, the Federal Government would be unable to manage theirs. I am talking about highways; I am talking about police protection; I am talking about health care and emergency care. All these things are provided without the basis of support that is usually there. So that is what the payment in lieu of taxes is all about. I know it is very difficult, but I think it is a program that merits some consideration and perhaps we will have the opportunity to increase those payments somewhat. 
   Actually, it is not confined to Western States. About 49 different States participate in the PILT program throughout the country, including the District of Columbia and three territories, so, of course, it is widespread in support. 
   Earlier this year, we had 57 Senators join in a letter 
   supporting an increase in PILT funding. I will submit, a little later, for consideration some opportunity perhaps to give a little boost to that kind of funding. It is something that has a real meaning. 
   Let me give a little example. We have 23 counties in my State of Wyoming. Teton County is 96 percent Federally owned, Park County, 82 percent federally owned, on down the line; in Big Horn County, which I mentioned a little while ago, 80 percent of that county belongs to the Federal Government. It goes on. So I think there is a great deal of interest in that, and in the question of fairness. 
   Let me say, too, even though the appropriations are not actually the area where these kinds of decisions are often made, I think it is important to recognize this administration has made a drive towards the end. I understand the President is seeking to change the legacy to be one of a sort of Theodore Roosevelt thing, with land acquisition, the proposal to have 40 million acres roadless, in addition to the Antiquities Act and other things. This is going on currently. 
   One of the difficulties is not so much the idea of controlling roads. I have no problem with that. There should not be roads everywhere; we need to take a look at them. I am more concerned about the method in which it has been undertaken. Rather than having a major decision made by bureaucrats in Washington, we ought to go through the process. We have what are called forest studies over several years, and we have forest planning. That is where it ought to be done, so the people locally can participate. 
   We have talked about all the meetings we have had, and I have attended some of them, but the problem is, because this was done on a nationwide basis, hardly anyone who came to the meetings knew what they were talking about, including many of the people from the Forest Service. So there needs to be some real input. Perhaps there is something we can do to slow down that area. 
   Going back to parks, there are some 27 or 28 parks where one of the access functions that people enjoy is using snow machines in the wintertime in places such as Teton Park and Yellowstone Park and in Minnesota--there are a number there. Now we have another one of these bureaucratic knee-jerk responses that we are going to eliminate the use of snowmobiles in national parks. 
   I do not argue there ought not be some control. There should be, and there can be. There ought to be some control over the machines themselves. The manufacturers have said they are willing to do that, to lower the noise and do something about the emissions. The problem is the EPA has never set up any standards with which they need to comply. I understand if you are going to put a great deal of money into  research to change these machines, you have to know where you need to be to be able to comply. We have never done this. 
   In addition, even though it seems as if a lot of people are using them, there are many fewer using the facilities in the wintertime. So it would have been possible, if the park had managed the snow machines rather than just letting them go, to separate the uses if they conflict with one another. If you have snow machines conflicting with cross-country skiers, in most parts you can have some space in between them. The park is never managed. Instead of seeking to manage these kinds of things, they simply say: Now we are going to do away with them. 
   The real issue there is access. Parks and public lands at 
   least have two major functions. One is to preserve the resource. The second is to give the owners, who are the taxpayers, an opportunity to enjoy them. One of the ways of enjoying them is, in this case, a snow machine. Rather than simply eliminate it, it seems to me we ought to take a little bit more time and find some ways to fit that into what we are doing, whether it is used for hunting or hiking or sightseeing. 
   We were talking about energy over here. One of the reasons we are having energy problems is that our domestic production is down. One of the reasons it is down is we have made it more difficult to have access in the public lands. In Wyoming, that is a real problem because half the land belongs to the Federal Government. 
   So I think there are a lot of things we can do to be able to still protect the resource yet provide for multiple use of those resources. 
   Finally, there is grazing. A year ago, the Senate bill had language in it that if the Bureau of Land Management, didn't have the resources to go in and investigate and take a look at a grazing allotment--if the BLM did not get there, as they were supposed to, then they could cancel the allotment of this grazing. All we are saying is, when the BLM can't get to it, until they are able to, they ought to be able to go on as they have before, under their original contract. That is language that should be there. We would like to make sure it is there as we go through this. 
   Finally, there is a wild horse problem. We have a large number of wild horses in Wyoming. Not many people have to deal with that problem. The administration has requested $9 million for the next 4 years as part of an effort to bring the wild horses back to manageable levels. As a matter of fact, in the Red Desert of Wyoming, about 10 years ago, there was a lawsuit which required that these numbers be brought down. The BLM has never done that. Now they say: We can't do it unless we have some additional funding. The House funded the administration's request, but an amendment on the floor brought it down to $5 million. The Senate bill does not fund the administration's request. Now we have the possibility of BLM taking money away from other uses unless they have some more resources to handle these wild horses. 
   I hope we can talk about some of these issues. I understand they are unique problems. I do not think there are many wild horses in Rhode Island, but they are in other places. This is the kind of bill where we have to deal with the unique things that happen in the West. 
   Again, I appreciate very much the work of the chairman. I know he comes from a western State with a considerable amount of unique and public resources as well. I also know that he is very interested in dealing with them fairly. 
   I compliment that effort. I want to work with him to see if we can deal with some of these other unique problems that arise. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. 
   Quite often we have difficulties, we have problems, and we really don't think about the policy that has created it--or in this case, the lack of policy. 
   I think it is very important that as we have the great growth of energy use in this country, that we take a look at our policy and not let ourselves become captives of overseas production.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are focusing today on energy and energy costs, which is something of which each of us is certainly aware. I suspect there is more exposure to gasoline prices than any other particular price. As we drive down Main Street in our hometowns, on every block we see a big sign showing the price of gasoline, and it certainly changes. 
   I wanted to go back a little, however. As the Senator from Arizona mentioned, there is a background here. I think there are several reasons, of course, why we have the price difficulties we have now. It is a complex story. It has to do with global supply and demand. It has to do with technological change and environmental consciousness, the shifting of consumer tastes, and social order. It also, of course, has a great deal to do with restrictions and regulations that have been imposed. 
   But one of the other things it has to do with is the availability and access to public lands. About 54 percent of the surface of this country belongs to the Federal Government. Most of that, of course, lies in the West. The State ownership in my State of Wyoming is about 50 percent of the total. It goes up to as high as 90 percent of the total in Nevada and Alaska and other States. So the idea of multiple use and access to these lands becomes a very important factor, not only for resources such as oil and gas, but equally important and perhaps even more important, often, for recreation, access for hunting and fishing recreation. We have seen, in recent months, an even more focused effort on the part of this administration to reduce access to public lands, to make it more difficult for the people who own those public lands to have an opportunity to utilize them. 
   After all, I happen to be the chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks. The purpose of a national park, of course, is not only to preserve the resource, the national treasure, but to make it available for the people who own it to use it; that is, the taxpayers of this country. It is true, parks are quite different than BLM lands, quite different than Forest Service lands, but the principle is still there; that we ought to preserve that resource and at the same time have multiple use so its owners can enjoy it for recreation, can enjoy it for hunting or fishing, so the economy of this country and the economy of this particular State can be enhanced by the multiple use of those resources. 
   As we move into different ways of prospecting for oil and different ways of mining, different ways of using snowmobiles and so on, we find we have a better opportunity, as time goes by, to use those resources without causing damage.  
   Particularly towards the end of this administration, and it has been stated very clearly by the Secretary of Interior and Assistant Secretaries of Interior, they are going to make a mark here. The President has indicated he would like to change his legacy to be like that of Theodore Roosevelt, who did all these things for public lands. The Secretary himself said: If the Congress is not going to do this, we will go ahead and do it without them. 
   That is a real challenge to one of the strong principles of this Government, the principle of divided government. We have it divided in the Constitution so we have the executive branch, we have the legislative branch, and we have the judicial branch. We have that separation for a very important reason. That is so none of those three branches is able to assume all the responsibility and all of the authority--and, frankly, very little of the accountability. 
   What we have seen in the last few months is a movement by the administration to go out on its own and make a bunch of regulations and do things, under the Antiquities Act, which reduce the availability of the lands for people who own them to enjoy them; for example, setting aside 40 million acres of forest lands as roadless. There are several problems with that. I don't particularly have any problem with some of that. We have lots of forest lands in my State, and I am glad we do. My parents' property, their ranch, where I grew up, was right next-door to a national forest. There is nothing I care more for. 
   But the fact is, we ought to have a system for deciding how we handle these lands. Instead of using the forest plan which is what the system is supposed to be, for instance, in the Black Hills we spent 7 years and $7 million doing a forest plan, and now the bureaucrats here in Washington decide we are going to have a national roadless area, without accommodating the people with an opportunity to discuss it for each of the forests, and without coming to the Congress. 
   Now there are a series of meetings going on which the Forest Service talks about a lot, but I have attended some of those and the fact is when you go, they are not able to tell you really what the plan is. So no one has a chance to react. So what we have, in effect, is the opportunity to avoid this. 
   The people I have heard from, who feel very strongly about it--some happen to be disabled persons, some happen to be veterans--say: Wait a minute, we don't need a road 
   everywhere. But we need enough roads to have access so people who cannot walk 17 miles with a pack on their back still have the opportunity to take advantage of that resource that is so important. So I think that is one of the things that is very difficult. 
   The Bureau of Land Management also put out a ruling on off-road usage. I don't have any problem with that either. We ought not to have four-wheelers going everywhere. We ought not to have roads going everywhere. But we ought to have a plan so people can have access by at least having a road for access. You don't need five roads; I understand that. So there needs to be a plan. 
   The Antiquities Act is a very important act. In fact, it was very important to my State of Wyoming with respect to the Devils Tower and the Grand Teton National Park; it gives the President the authority to set aside certain lands in special use. Relatively little of that has happened over the last few years, but this President in the last 6 months has set aside hundreds of thousands of acres, without the involvement of anyone. That is not the system. This is the same administration that wants to do an environmental impact statement on everything that is done, so you could have public input. I am for that. I pushed very hard to have the opportunity for local governments to be involved in the decisions that are made and impact their States. There are no such decisions here, just one made by this administration. 
   Now we have what is called a CARE Act, to take $3.5 billion from offshore royalties and have it as mandatory spending, where the Congress has nothing to do with deciding how use of that money is planned, $1 billion a year to be used for the acquisition of more and more Federal lands. We feel very strongly about that in the West. It doesn't mean there are not pieces of land that need to be acquired, need to be set aside--no one opposes that. But the fact is, if you want to acquire more land in Wyoming, which is already 50 percent Federal owned, why not go ahead and acquire it and then release an equal value of Federal lands somewhere else so you don't have a net gain. That is a reasonable thing to do and we intend to pursue that, in terms of this CARE Act. 
   The endangered species, again, who argues with endangered species, trying to protect the critters? The fact is, however, there has been no involvement in the listing of the animals; there has been very little opportunity to find a recovery plan. We have had grizzly bears listed now for 10 years around Yellowstone Park. The numbers have far exceeded the goal that was set. But you can talk about habitat forever and they continue to be there. We just have to manage this public land so it is available and useful. 
   The Clean Water Act, nonpoint-source clean water, has also been used to manage land. 
   That is where we are. Interestingly, the latest one has been the proposal to ban snowmobiles from Yellowstone Park--in fact, from 27 parks. Again, I don't argue that there needs to be more management of these vehicles so you ought to do something about the noise, ought to do something about the air emissions, ought to do something about separating them so we have a snow team over here, we can have cross-country skiers over here, without interfering with each other. The fact is, the Park Service over 20 years has never done anything to manage this thing. 
   Now all of a sudden they say: It is not going the way it ought to, so we are going to ban it for everyone. That is not a good way to manage a resource. 
   We find an increasing bureaucratic self-declaration that they are going to do these things, and if the Congress does not like it, that is too bad. That is not the way this Government is designed to work. Quite frankly, we cannot let that happen. 
   How does this tie into energy? As I mentioned before, almost 55 percent of public land in the West belongs to the Federal Government. Most of the opportunities for resource development have been on these Federal lands in the West. They have been a very important part of the State economies. They have been a very important part of the natural production. 
   Over the last several years, it has become more and more difficult, because of regulations and rules, for people to go on these lands and produce resources, even though they very clearly, under the law, have to reclaim the land, whether it is mining or oil wells. We have an increased demand for energy on the one hand and a reduction in production on the other, and we are certainly a victim of overseas production. 
   Americans consume over 130 billion gallons of gasoline, almost four times as much as 50 years ago. Consumption has grown at a rate of 1.5 percent. That translates to about 8.4 million barrels a day, which is 45 percent of the total oil production. There is increased usage, a reduction in domestic production, and we are at the mercy of OPEC. 
   It is also interesting that in 1999, the tax component of gasoline was approximately 40 cents a gallon, or about 34 percent of the total cost. Interestingly enough, the price component of a gallon of gas, crude oil, and taxes is about equal: 18.5 cents is Federal and 20 cents is the average State tax that is levied on top. 
   We also find ourselves with additional restrictions and regulations, put on this year, with making some changes in our policy if we are to deal with this increased demand. Obviously, there are a number of things that ought to be done over time. 
   We ought to take a look at consumption and continue pushing for high-mileage vehicles and reduce demand. 
   We need to take a look at domestic production so we are not totally dependent on imported energy. 
   We need to take a long look at the regulations and see if there are alternatives and whether they can be more economical, and whether, in fact, what we are doing has been thoroughly thought through. I am not sure that has been the case.  
   I have no objection to taking a long look at the pricing of gasoline as well. It is interesting that there is such a great disparity in prices in different parts of the country. Perhaps there is a good, logical reason for that. If so, we should know about it. 
   I hope our energy policy does not become totally political. The fact is, we have not had an energy policy in this administration. We have held hearings in our committee, not only with this Secretary of Energy, but the previous two Secretaries of Energy. One says: Yes, we are going to have a policy. The fact is, we do not. The fact is, we have not been able to fully utilize coal. We have not been able to take advantage of nuclear power by stalling in getting our nuclear waste stored. There are a lot of things we need to do and, indeed, should do. It is unfortunate we have not had the cooperation from this administration.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wish to talk about a conversation I heard yesterday on the Sunday talk shows. It is too bad that on the Sunday talk shows the issues are not more clearly defined. 
   This talk show was on Social Security and options, which are clearly legitimate options. The options separate the points of view of the parties and the candidates. I am talking about taking a portion of the Social Security program, as it now exists for an individual, and putting it into his or her private account and investing it in the private sector in equities or in bonds or a combination of the two. The return stays with this person because it is their account. 
   Out of the 12.5 percent that each of us pay--and each of these young people will pay in the first job they have, and if something does not happen by the time they are ready for benefits, there will be none. We have to make some changes. 
   One of the changes we can make, of course, is to increase taxes. There is not a lot of enthusiasm for that. For many people, Social Security is the highest tax: 12.5 percent right off the top. 
   The second change is we could reduce benefits. Not many people are interested in reducing benefits. 
   The third change is to take those dollars that are put into the so-called trust fund and invest them for a higher return. Under the law, those dollars can only be invested in Government securities which, in this case, is a very low return. 
   We are talking about taking those same dollars that belong to you and to me and putting them in individual accounts. They can be invested, and the earnings would be part of that person's Social Security payment. 
   Yesterday, the implication was that would be a part of it, and then we have to fix up Social Security and replace all the money that is put in these private accounts. That is not the fact. The fact is, they are still part of Social Security, but they are yours. You make a decision how they are invested, and then you get your 10 percent, as it always is, plus the return to the 2 percent on top of that, and that represents your benefits. 
   The lady yesterday representing the Clinton administration indicated we would have to replace all those dollars and go ahead with Social Security as it is. That is just not the fact. 
   This is an opportunity for us to increase the return, to ensure those dollars and those benefits will be there when the time comes for someone to receive them, and to do that without increasing taxes, without reducing benefits, but by simply taking advantage of the opportunity of a better return on the investment. 
   A couple of Senators are going to be here shortly. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank particularly the Senator from Arizona for his very thorough and accurate description of where we are and where we have been in terms of our nuclear security, in terms specifically of the Los Alamos matter, and more importantly, of course, where we are in terms of overall security, which has to be one of the most important things this Government has to do. The Senator is probably one of the more knowledgeable Members in terms of the military, in terms of intelligence, so I appreciate that very much. 
   Unfortunately, we have been through this now several times, the matter of having a system upon which we could rely for the security of our nuclear arsenal and secure military information. And even though this is a very trying thing we are involved in now, really the overall system is what is worrisome. If we are having these kinds of difficulties at Los Alamos--there are a number of places in this country where, of course, we are required to have security--and if we have that notion that there is no more security there than there has proven to be, then we have to wonder, of course, about the other facilities in this country which require the same kind of security. 
   I believe, as the Senator mentioned, the real issue is that we went through this before, not very many months ago. I happen to be on the Energy Committee in which we listened to this a 
   great many times; we listened to the Wen Ho Lee question, and we heard from the Secretary that now we were going to take care of this issue and now you could rest assured we would have security. 
   The fact is we do not. The fact is that apparently there are some very simple kinds of things that could be done that would have alleviated this problem. It is difficult to understand that in a place such as Los Alamos, where you have secure storage for this kind of information, as someone said, you have less security than Wal-Mart in terms of checking in and out. That is really very scary. 
   So my point is that we really have to take a long look at the system. As the Senator pointed out, Congress established a while back a semiautonomous unit that was to have responsibility for nuclear security. The Secretary did not approve of that. The President, despite the fact that he signed it, did not approve it either, and therefore it was never inaugurated; it was never put into place. That raises another issue, of course, that is equally troubling to me, and that is that this administration has sort of had the notion that, if we don't agree with what the Congress has done, we simply won't do it, or, if we want to do something the Congress doesn't agree with, we will go ahead and do it. 
   That is really troublesome to me in that one of the real benefits of freedom, one of the real benefits of the operation of this country over the years, has been the division of power, the constitutional division among the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary. It is so vital, and we need to retain it. We find increasing evidence of the fact that some of it, of course, is in the closing chapters of this administration, but they are determined that if they don't happen to like what the Congress has done or can do something that Congress will not accept, they go ahead and do it. This is not right. This is really very scary. 
   We have, as you all know, a great many young people who come to visit the Senate, come to visit their Capitol, and I am delighted that they do. People want to see all the buildings, and they want to see the people who are currently filling these offices and in the White House. But the fact is that the Constitution is really the basis for our freedom. That is what other countries do not have, a Constitution and a rule of law to carry it out. 
   So when we threaten the division of power, then it really is worrisome, and I think we have the great responsibility to make sure that that does not in fact happen. In this instance, I think we have had a pretty patent rejection of the things the Congress has done and put into law and that have not, indeed, been implemented. 
   There are a number of important matters, of course, that are before us as we enter into what are almost the closing months of this Congress. We have accomplished a number of things that are very useful; we have some tax reform, some welfare reform; we have done some things for the military, to strengthen it. There are a number of items, of course, yet to be done. 
   One of them, of course, that is imperative is the passage of appropriations, all of which have to be done before the end of September, which is the end of the fiscal year. One of the scary things for the Congress, I believe, again, with this sort of contest sometimes with the executive branch, is if we do not finish these things in time, the President would threaten, of course, as he did before, to shut down the Government and blame the Congress for doing that and use the leverage for the budget to be quite different from what the Congress would like it to be. Therefore, we need to move forward. 
   I was in Wyoming this weekend, as I am nearly every weekend. There is a good deal of concern about regulatory reform, the idea that, first of all, we have probably excessive regulation in many places. One of the most current examples, I believe, might be in the area of the price of gasoline where, without much consideration of where we were going and its result, we have had more regulations to control diesel fuel and gasoline, which is at least a part of the reason that gas prices are as high as they are, the lack of a policy in energy. We have allowed ourselves to become overly dependent on OPEC and the rest of the world by limiting or restricting, through regulation, our access to energy that could be produced in the United States so at least we were not 60-percent dependent, as we soon will be, on overseas production. 
   Those are the things with which we ought to be dealing in terms of excessive regulation. 
   One of the ways to fix that is to have a system whereby once the laws are passed by the legislature and are implemented by the executive branch through regulation, those regulations should come back to the legislative body to ensure the thrust of the legislation is reflected in the regulations. 
   This happens in most States. Most State legislators have an opportunity to look at the regulations once they have been drafted to ensure it reflects the intent of the legislation. 
   We passed a law in 1996 to do that. Unfortunately, it has not worked. We have had 12,000 regulations. Very few have come back because they have to go through OMB to be scanned out, first of all. I believe there has been some effort to change five of them, but none of have been changed because the system does not work. 
   I introduced a bill 3 weeks ago that will give us an opportunity to look at the regulations and accept the responsibility that a legislature has to oversee the implementation of regulations to ensure the laws are carried out properly. 
   We have a responsibility for energy policy. I mentioned that. This administration does not have an energy policy. We have not dealt with the question of how to encourage and, indeed, should  we encourage the production of domestic petroleum. We have great petroleum reserves in the West and in ANWR. Better ways of exploring and producing resources that are more protective of the environment are being developed. Yet we do not have a policy to do that. We find ourselves at the mercy of OPEC. 
   We have to deal with the question of coal production. There are ways in which we can use that resource and make it more environmentally friendly. We have to recognize that is a main source of electric production as we find ourselves using more and more electricity and our generating capacity is not growing, partly because of a lack of an energy policy. Interestingly enough, the problem we are having with security also is in the Energy Department. So the Senator's suggestion that perhaps we have some changes there may apply to some other issues as well. 
   Many of us are very interested in public land management. In the West, in my State, 50 percent of the State belongs to the Federal Government. In most States in the West, it is even higher than that. Nevada is nearly 90 percent federally owned. 
   The people who live there need a way with which to deal with the question of public land management. I happen to be chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks. Clearly, the goal is to maintain those resources. They are great natural resources. They are national treasures. 
   At the same time, as we maintain those facilities and resources they ought to be available to their owners--the taxpayers--to visit. This administration is seeking to limit access in a number of ways, such as a nationwide rule automatically designating 40 million acres roadless. I have no objection to looking at roadless areas. We have roadless areas, and we ought to manage those. It ought to be done on the basis of forest plans for each individual forest instead of one plan. 
   I see the Forest Service is proud of all the meetings they have been having to have input. I attended some of those meetings. The fact is, people have very little information 
   available to them when they go to the meetings and cannot respond. Sometimes they are not asked to respond but only to listen to a broad description of where it is going. There was great discussion in the House about the Antiquities Act which is an old law. Theodore Roosevelt used it years ago. Most of us have no problem with the concept that the President can, through Executive order, change their lands and change their designation. This is limitless and has been used more over the last few months by this administration than at any time in memory without involvement of the local people. 
   All these things go together. Now we are faced with a proposition to take $1 billion a year to acquire more Federal land without any recognition of the fact that the States in the West are already heavily federally owned. 
   These are some issues about which we need to be talking. My friend on the other side of the aisle in the previous hour was talking about Social Security. He was very critical of the idea of allowing Social Security payers to take a portion of their Social Security and invest it in equities in the marketplace so that the return will be four or five times what it is now. 
   Unfortunately, for young people, such as these pages, when they make their first dollars, 12.5 percent of it will be put into Social Security. If things do not change, there is very little chance they will have any benefits for them. 
   How do we change that? Raise taxes? I do not think people are interested in that. We can reduce benefits; I do not think many are interested in that. 
   One alternative is to take those dollars now invested under law in Government securities and return 1 percent on investment and allow 2 percent of the 12 percent to be invested in personal accounts. The account belongs to the payer and will be invested on their behalf as they direct, whether it is in equities, bonds, or a combination of the two. If they should be unfortunate enough to pass away before they ever get the benefits, it will go to their estate. 
   There is great criticism about that on the other side of the aisle without a good alternative as to how we are going to provide benefits for young Social Security payers as they enter into the program. I should mention, one of the safety factors is that no one over 50 or 55 will be impacted or affected. Their Social Security will not change. 
   These are a few of the things with which we ought to be dealing. 
   Tax relief: We seem to be greatly concerned about what we do with excess money that will appear in this year's budget. Certainly, there are some things we ought to do. One of them, of course, is to adequately fund Government programs. I understand people have different ideas about that, but we can do that and there would still be substantial excess dollars available. 
   The next priority is to make sure Social Security is there and those Social Security dollars are not spent for operations, which is something we have done over years, until the last couple of years. That ought to be set aside so it does not happen. We ought to be dealing with Medicare making sure those dollars are set aside as well and not spent for operations so those benefits will be available. 
   Frankly--and I realize there are different views and that is what the Senate is about--but there are those generally on that side of the aisle whose idea--and it is legitimate--is that the Federal Government ought to be spending more, doing more; the Federal Government ought to undertake to solve all these problems. I do not happen to agree with that. I happen to think we ought to have a limited Federal Government; that, indeed, we ought to do those things the Federal Government ought to be doing, but it should not be involved in all of our lives. That is what the private sector is for. That is what local governments are for. That is what State governments are for. 
   Of course, that is the philosophical argument with which we are all faced. One of the elements of that is tax relief. We have passed one tax relief bill this year. We passed the marriage penalty tax which is more of a fairness issue than anything. It deals with the fact that a man and woman, earning a certain amount of money, unmarried pay a certain amount in taxes. These two same people get married, earning the same amount of money and pay more income taxes. It is wrong. We passed a bill in both Houses. Now we need to make sure the President signs it. 
   The estate tax is another one that takes away over 50 percent of an estate above a certain level. 
   We ought to make that more fair. Tax relief is certainly one of the things that we ought to be doing, that we ought to be talking about. Unfortunately, what we are faced with now is that we find ourselves in a position where I think many in the body are more interested in creating issues than they are in finding solutions. We find the same issues being brought up time after time after time. For example, my friend again talked about gun control this morning. He talked about additional laws, when the fact is, clearly, what is really important is the enforcement of the laws that we have now. 
   In the Colorado incident, there were 22 laws broken. Do we need more laws? Probably not. What we need to do is enforce them. The General Accounting Office did an audit of the effectiveness of the national instant criminal background check. As of September of 1999, the ATF headquarters staff had screened 70,000 denials and concluded that only 22,000 had merit. Only 1 percent of those denials were ever pursued as to if the person trying to buy a gun was, in fact, legally allowed to. Clearly, that issue has been talked about here. It basically has been resolved. 
   We keep talking about the Patients' Bill of Rights. We passed it in both Houses. The question now is whether, when you need an appeal from your HMO, you go to the court or physicians in an appeal position, whether you want to take a year and a half to go to court, or whether you want an automatic and quick response from professionals in the medical profession who say: Yes, do it. That is where we are. 
   You hear in the media that the Senate defeated the Patients' Bill of Rights. That is not true. The Patients' Bill of Rights has been passed by this Congress in both Houses. We need now to put it together. Indeed, it is in conference. 
   We find ourselves debating education. We find ourselves having to pull away from the elementary and secondary  education bill in which the Federal Government participates--not heavily. The Federal Government's role in funding elementary and secondary education is about 7 percent of the total expenditure. But the argument is whether the decisions are made in Washington as to how that 7 percent is used before it is sent down to the school districts or whether we send down the 7 percent and let the States and the school districts decide, which is what our position is on this side. 
   I spoke at a graduation a couple weeks ago in Chugwater, WY. The graduating class was 12. You can see that is a pretty small school. The things they need in Chugwater, WY, are quite different than what you need in Pittsburgh or Philadelphia or Washington, DC. So if you are going to really be able to help all different kinds of schools and have the flexibility to do that, clearly, you have to transport those decisions to State and local government. 
   These are some of the things in which we find ourselves involved. I am hopeful we can move forward. I do not expect everyone to agree. Certainly, that is not why we are here. But we ought to have a system where, No. 1, after we have dealt with an issue, we can move on to the next issue, and not have it continuously brought up as nongermane amendments, which is happening all the time. We ought to be able to say, we have a system where we can participate. But we have a system that can hold everything up, which is being used now in not allowing us to move forward as we should. 
   As you can imagine, it gets just a little bit nerve-racking from time to time when you think of all the things that we could be doing, and need to be doing, but find it difficult to do. 
   Finally, there is something, it seems to me, that would be most helpful if we could do it a little more. We are talking now about the reregulation of electricity, trying to make it competitive so there would be better opportunity for people to choose their supplier, so there would be a better opportunity for people to invest in generation, and do all those things. But we really have not decided where we want to go and where we want to be. 
   One of the things that seems to be difficult for us to do in governance is, first of all, to decide what we want to accomplish and then talk about how we get there. It sounds like a fairly simple routine, but it is not really happening. It would be good if we could do that, if we could say, for example, in terms of the Patients' Bill of Rights: All right, what do we want the result to be? What is our goal? What do we want to accomplish? and see if we could not define that, and then make the rules, make the regulations, pass the laws that would implement that decision. But instead, if we do not have that clearly defined, it seems that we continue to go around and around. 
   I am sometimes reminded by children of Alice in Wonderland. She fell through the hole in the Earth and was lost, and she talked to people to try to get some directions. None of them were very useful. She finally came to the Cheshire cat who was sitting up in a tree at a fork in the road. 
   She said: Mr. Cat, which road should I take? 
   He said: Where do you want to go? 
   She said: I don't know. 
   He said: Then it doesn't make any difference which road you take. 
   That is kind of where we are in some of the things we do. In any event, we are going to make some progress. I hope that we move forward and get our appropriations finished. I hope we can do something on national security. We need to have a system that works to decide what it is we want to accomplish, how we best accomplish that, and put it into place.

    Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation, along with my colleagues Senators SHELBY, BREAUX, CONRAD and REID to make it easier for Americans to participate in the decision-making process in their state capitols. Current tax law denies main street business the ability to deduct legitimate expenses incurred while advocating their positions at the state level of government. This legislation will remove both the financial and administrative penalties imposed by this ``grassroots advocacy tax.'' 
   As part of the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Congress approved a proposal recommended by President Clinton to deny the deductibility of expenses incurred to lobby on legislative issues. As passed, the bill created an ``advocacy tax'' by denying a business tax deduction for expenses incurred to address legislation at both the state and federal levels. Expenses incurred regarding the legislative actions of local governments, however, are exempt from this tax. 
   When the deductibility for lobbying expenses was partially repealed in 1993, the debate centered on activities at the federal level. The fact that lobbying at the local level is exempt indicates that the original authors of this proposal did not intend to cover all lobbying activities. Although lobbying at the state level was not part of the debate, it was included in the final legislation that was approved by Congress. This grassroots advocacy tax is an unwarranted intrusion of the federal government on the activity of state governments. We should not make it harder for Americans to participate in the decision making process in their state capitols. 
   At the state level, there is more active outside participation in the legislative process. This is partly because state legislatures have smaller staffs and meet less frequently than the U.S. Congress. In most states, the job of state legislator is part-time. In addition, many governors appoint ``Blue Ribbon Commissions'' and other advisory groups to recommend legislative solutions to problems peculiar to a specific state. These advisory groups depend on input from members of the business, professional and agricultural community knowledgeable about particular issues. 
   However, the record keeping requirements and penalties associated with this tax discourage and penalize participation in the legislative process by businesses in all fifty states. This is especially true for the many state trade associations, most of whom are small operations not equipped to comply with the pages and pages of confusing federal regulations implementing this law. Compliance is both time consuming and complicated, and detracts from the legitimate and necessary work and services they perform for their members, who are primarily small businesses that depend on these associations to look after their interests. 
   This bill is very simple. It restores the deductibility of business expenses incurred for activities to deal with legislation at the state level, and gives them the same treatment that exists under current law for similar activities at the local level. This change will help ensure that the voices of citizen advocates and main street businesses will  be heard in their state capitols. It is good legislation and it should be enacted into law.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Ohio. I certainly could not agree more that when we have--as we do and will--a surplus, we need to decide where our priorities are in terms of spending those dollars. I can tell you, if they are just left here, they will be spent. If our priorities do lie in funding what our programs are, in ensuring that Social Security maintains itself, and that Medicare is there, and when we want to ensure that we keep a balanced budget and start to pay down our debt, then we have to commit ourselves to do those things. I think it is an excellent idea for those dollars, so that they won't be spent for something else. I also think we ought to pay down the debt, and we hopefully will have some opportunity to get some tax relief. It is tougher, interestingly enough, when you have a surplus to make sure that the money is used as beneficially as when you are dealing with a deficit. That is what I wanted to talk about this morning. 
   That is how we might make Government more efficient. You know, we talk about that a lot. Most of us talk about less Federal Government and how do we make sure the dollars are spent as efficiently as they can be and, hopefully, how we can arrive at 
   a situation where those people who earn the dollars can keep more of them. That ought to be part of our goal. 
   I think there are some things that this Congress ought to consider, and they seem very important to me--ways in which we intend to ensure that the Government is more efficient, that the Federal Government indeed is limited in size, and that we make certain the Federal Government does those things that are defined in the Constitution and not those other things that are not and should be left to the States and the people. That is what the Constitution says. That is what most of us want. 
   Particularly, I suppose, when you come from a State such as mine, Wyoming, where we have a relatively low population, where we have a lot of open space and not too many folks, then the way you have programs function is different than it is in Connecticut and different than it is in Pittsburgh. So you really need that flexibility and you need to be doing as much governance as can be done, in my opinion, as close to people as possible so that it fits. That is what we ought to be talking about--less bureaucracy and more responsiveness, and doing what we need to do. This budget process that we are going through now is quite important, not only with respect to spending the money, but we really define for ourselves what we think the priorities are in terms of the needs of the American people, and what the role of the Federal Government is to help satisfy those needs. It is difficult. 
   I think it is fair to say that governments have less discipline than the private sector. There is really nothing to force the Government to have to behave in different ways, which is true in the private sector. I come from a business background. I tell you, you have  to make changes from time to time because the economy makes it imperative that you do that, or you go broke. You are forced to change. That is not so with the Government. There is no competition there, so you are not forced to do things. I am not totally critical of the Government, by any means. I am only saying that there is a difference between how you run the Government and how you run the private sector. I believe there are a number of factors in the private sector that would help make the Federal Government much more effective. You have to force change. Change doesn't come about easily in a bureaucracy. Governments tend to go on as they have in the past. They tend to say that is what we have done before and what we will continue to do. It is resistant to change. So seldom are they forced to reorganize. Agencies are insulated, to some extent, by the Congress. If we don't do some things to bring about change, then change doesn't come about. I think it is our responsibility to do some of those things. 
   There are a number of ideas that I believe will help strengthen the system--ideas that are adapted from the private sector, to a large extent. They have to be initiated by the Congress, and there has to be a system in which the Congress exercises its responsibility for oversight to make sure that does not happen. There has to be a way that things are audited, that things are reviewed to see if, in fact, we are accomplishing the things that are set out to do. 
   The first would be, of course, to establish goals. 
   I have recently been involved in electric deregulation. We have had great battles over it. I am not sure what is going to happen or whether it will be done this year. We are seeking, however, to make some changes in the electric generating and distribution system. It has been a regulated utility for years. We want to see if we can't do it a little better in other ways. 
   Do you know what else we should do, in my opinion? We haven't really defined what we want. We get all wrapped up in what is going on. We are going to do this, or that, or this, when we haven't really clearly defined what we want the end result to be. 
   It seems to me it would be very productive if this Congress--maybe when we start to deal with campaign finance--knew what it wanted in the end. I think we could do that. If you are not certain where you are going--remember the old story of Alice in Wonderland. She fell through the hole and talked to all of the different people, and didn't get any advice. Finally, she saw the Cheshire cat up in the tree, and she was right at the junction of the road. She said: Cat, which road should I take? The cat said: Where do you want to go? She said: I don't know. The cat said: Then it doesn't make any difference what road you take. 
   That is kind of where we are sometimes. If we don't know what we want to accomplish, then how do we get there? 
   I think instead of emphasizing the process, which we often do, we then need to measure results. That is really what it ought to be about. That is where you have the flexibility by saying you worry so much about how you get there but you measure the results at the end. There are things we can do. 
   Congress needs to first define where we are going, define how we get there, and then measure the results; give some flexibility so that things can be done differently in different places. The health care system delivery is much different in Wyoming from what it is in California. You have to have some flexibility to do that. 
   Congressional oversight is something that, unfortunately, we probably don't do as much as we should. That is what committee meetings are for. That is what audits are for. When you pass a law and say here is where we want to go, then you have to say: How are we getting there? We don't do that well. 
   The Republicans and the majority party have been putting emphasis on oversight. I think that is a great thing to do. That is why I like biennial appropriations--so you don't have to spend 2 years doing appropriations. We ought to do them every other year, and spend the interim year seeing if the money we are spending is doing the things we intended. 
   The Constitution divides the responsibilities in the Federal Government for a reason; that is, so that no one segment of Government controls everything. We have an executive branch; we have a legislative branch; we have a judicial branch. It is for good reason: To divide and strengthen the responsibilities and power so there is balance. 
   We, frankly, find that particularly this administration, as their time expires, is moving far beyond what the legislature has authorized and doing many things by regulation without talking at all with the Congress or, indeed, to the people. I think we have to really make sure that what the law intends is carried out. 
   Congress passed a bill in 1998, which I authored, which 
   defines the various activities of Congress: Listing those activities that are inherently governmental, listing those that are not, and listing those that could better be done by contract in the private sector. We passed that bill. We have had some progress. There has been a listing, generally. 
   By the way, the Defense Department, in my opinion, does a better job of contracting than any other agency. That ought to be the role of an agency, to strengthen their ability to manage contracts, but to let those contracts go out to the private sector and people who do that professionally and more efficiently all of the time. I think that is something we really ought to be able to do. 
   We also need, of course, to find a way to terminate programs. 
   I mentioned in the beginning that Government tends to perpetuate itself. It seems to go on. I understand that. There ought to be a way to have some kind of sunset mechanism. After a period of time, hopefully, a job is finished. Not in every case, but in some cases the work is completed, and the mission is accomplished. Then we ought to do away with that agency or activity that was developed for a particular job. Unfortunately, in the political system, as you start a program of that kind, it builds its own constituency and seems never to go away. But we need to have a way to do that. I think the sunset idea is an interesting one. 
   We have been talking about these for some time. 
   I am really delighted to see in the news today what Gov. George Bush suggested. One is opening positions to commercial activities, and another one is result oriented and talking about doing the very things we are talking about here. If we could have an administration that agrees with Congress to move that way, we could do it. 
   I close by saying I introduced last week the Congressional Regulatory Review Reform Act of 2000. In 1993, a bill was passed that said regulations needed to be sent back to Congress for some kind of oversight. We found increasingly, particularly in this administration, that there was an effort and an agenda to move regulation by Executive orders that could not get through the legislative process--to sort of go around it. Unfortunately, Congress has allowed this to happen and has delegated much of its legislative responsibility to the bureaucracy in terms of the regulations that are written to implement the law. 
   Clearly, Congress can't go into huge detail, nor should it. But the important thing is that the regulations designed to implement the law need to carry out the intent. 
   In my subcommittee last week we had a meeting on national parks. We have a very good national park bill that was passed in 1998. Now we are implementing that bill. We are having discussions as to how we ensure the regulations that are developed in fact bring about the change intended in the legislation and that regulations don't simply keep it as it was. 
   The system we passed in 1996 has not worked as well as it should. Over 12,000 nonmajor rules and 186 major rules have been submitted to Congress--major rules being ones that have more than $100 million in impact on the private sector. Out of 12,000, only 7 resolutions of disapproval have been introduced pertaining to 5 bills. None has passed either House. So it isn't working as it should. 
   We are trying to make some changes and say, rather than just going to the Office of Management and Budget, it ought to go to GAO, which is the general auditing organization. Then it should come to Congress so Congress  has an opportunity to take a look at it. If indeed it doesn't reflect the intent, Congress should have a chance to change it. 
   Those are some of the things that I think would help implement the things we are doing. It would help to have a smaller and more efficient Government. It would help us, Mr. President, as you pointed out, to set aside some of the dollars that ought to be used to pay down the debt and go back to the taxpayers. I think we have a great opportunity to do that. I hope we focus on that. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, on May 6-8, 2000, more than 1200 students from across the United States came to Washington, D.C. to compete in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program. I am proud to announce that the class from Green River High School in Green River, Wyoming, represented my state in this national event. These young scholars worked diligently to reach the national finals and through their experience have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy. 
   The participating students were Richard Baxter, Natalie Binder, Katharine Bracken, Cameron Kelsey, Sandra Newton, Jacque Owen, Jeremy Pitts, Benjamin Potmesil, Meagan Reese, Rachel Ryckman, Ryan Stewart, and Steven Ujvary. I also want to recognize their teacher, Dennis Johnson, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the team. 
   The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after hearings in the United States Congress, during which a panel of judges from a variety of appropriate professional fields probes the students for their depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge. 
   The class from Green River represented the state of Wyoming well during the finals, and I wish these ``constitutional experts'' the best of luck as they continue to cultivate their interest in the principles upon which our great country was founded.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we will go to the Senator from Minnesota shortly and then the Senator from Texas and then the Senator from Idaho. In the meantime, while they are coming, let me say I have briefly listened to my friends on the other side of the aisle, interestingly enough, complaining about not getting anywhere. Let me talk a little bit about that. 
   We have been here on the floor now for some time talking about the kinds of things people want to do in this country; for instance, education--elementary and secondary education. We had to pull that after a whole week of discussion and debate because our friends on the other side of the aisle didn't want to move forward. They wanted to bring up the same things  they have brought up every time we have come into this Chamber, and they have done it over and over and over again. 
   If you want to talk about getting something done, we ought to talk a little bit about education, a little bit about Social Security, a little bit about the military and doing some things for security that we ought to do for this country. Frankly, I think some of us get weary of the same litany every day and going back and forth on the same thing. We have already talked about gun control; we have gun control pending. We have talked about Patients' Bill of Rights; it is pending. It is out there in conference committee. What we need to do is address ourselves to some of the issues that are here. 
   You can see that I get just a little bit excited about this. But we have an opportunity to do some things. We have to do some things on this floor, and we need to move forward and stop this business of holding up everything so we can talk about trying to make issues for the election instead of trying to find solutions. 
   I yield to my friend, the Senator from Minnesota.

    Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to curb Federal over-regulation by the executive branch of Government and to restore congressional accountability for the regulatory process. 
   The annual regulatory costs of the Federal Government on the private sector have been estimated to be $200-$800 billion annually. The pace and scope of over-regulation has accelerated under the Clinton Administration. For example, the IRS has tried to raise taxes administratively, the EPA has exceeded its authority with the Clean Water Action Plan and the National Park Service is trying to eliminate snowmobile use in our national parks, all without congressional authorization. Increasingly, we have found that this administration tries to advance through regulation and executive order an agenda it cannot get done through the normal legislative process. In fact, there are currently 137 major regulations in the works that will each have at least a $100 million cost. That means these new regulations will impose at least a $13.7 billion yearly impact on the economy. 
   Unfortunately, Congress has allowed this to happen. For years Congress has delegated its most fundamental responsibility--the creation of laws--to the executive branch. Consequently, rather than just enforce laws, these unelected bureaucrats now also write the laws. These regulatory bureaucracies have often been called the fourth branch of Government. This fourth branch has misinterpreted, undercut and directly contradicted the will of Congress time and time again. It is well past time to end this ``regulation without representation.'' 
   As many of my colleagues know, Congress passed the Congressional Review Act in 1996 in an attempt to slow the executive regulatory machine. For the first time, this law established a process by which Congress can review and disapprove virtually all federal agency rules. Unfortunately, the promise of the Act has not been fulfilled. 
   Between 1996 and 1999, 12,269 non-major rules and 186 major rules were submitted to Congress by federal agencies. Only seven joint resolutions of disapproval were introduced, pertaining to five rules. None passed either House. In fact, none have even been debated on the floor of either House. 
   The legislation I introduce today will address the flaws in the Congressional Review Act and restore the proper balance between the congressional and executive branches when it comes to rule-making. The Congressional Regulatory Review Reform Act will require all major rules (those with a $100 million annual impact as defined by the Office of Management in consultation with GAO) to be approved by Congress before they take effect. If Congress disapproves a rule, an agency will be precluded from proposing the same or similar rule for a period of 6 months. A rule may be given interim effectiveness if the President determines and certifies that a rule should take effect because of an imminent threat to health and safety or emergency (this decision is not judicially reviewable). Finally, the president is authorized to establish, by executive order a program for the systematic review of agency rules. 
   I believe that congressional review and accountability for federal regulations will improve efficiency and lessen federal government intervention in the daily lives of the American people. Congress cannot allow the Executive Branch to continue to legislate through rules and regulations. Congress must be responsible. Congress must take back its constitutionally granted authority over the rule-making process. 
   This is not a partisan issue. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer suggested this idea as long ago as 1984. Nor is the purpose of this legislation to overturn a great number of rules submitted by agencies. It is intended to increase incentives regulators have to respond to the views of the general public, rather than narrow interests and to make Congress and the president more politically accountable for the resulting rules. 
   Mr. President, I am hopeful my colleagues will join me in supporting this commonsense, good government reform.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to talk a little bit about the things we have accomplished in this last session of the Congress, the first year, which is over. We are into the second year of this 106th Congress. 
   We are having a little problem moving along, of course, and we are trying to find a way to avoid holding up progress after the filing of unrelated amendments that have turned out to be filibusters. I hope we can get around that and move forward with the 13 appropriations bills we have. 
   We ought to recognize this has been a productive session. We have done a great deal. But there are a number of things I think are of particular importance to the American people. One, obviously, is to do something with the Social Security retirement system. We have done a great deal with that over the last year. Although there still needs to be some systematic changes made to the program, we can ensure that the program will be there over time. 
   We have made a very significant movement by providing that the 12 1/2 percent of our earnings paid into Social Security by everyone who works in this country is, in fact, used for Social Security. Historically, over a very long time, those dollars have been used for many non-Social Security programs. Because of this Republican Congress, because of the lockbox idea, we have put that money aside. It is not being spent for other items. That is very significant. 
   I hope we can proceed and look at alternatives to ensure that the young people who are now just beginning to pay into the program will have a program of benefits when the time comes for them to be eligible for the benefits. Frankly, the program has changed in terms of the profile of people. When we began, there were some 20 people working for every one drawing benefits. Now it is less than 3 and will be down to 2. 
   Obviously, things have to be changed. There are some options: We can raise taxes. I don't know of anyone excited about that. We can reduce benefits. The same is true with that. Or, indeed, we can take a portion of those dollars and make them individual accounts for each person--2 percent out of the 12 percent is what we are talking about--and let that money be invested in their behalf, invested in equities, let it be invested in bonds, let it be invested in a combination of their choice, for their retirement, or as part of their estate if they are not fortunate enough to live. 
   The issue most talked about is education. Only about 7 percent of the finances of education in this country, elementary and secondary, are provided by the Federal Government. There is a great deal of discussion about how that is allocated and how it is made available. The big debate, and the reason we haven't gone further with elementary and secondary reauthorization, is there is a difference of view.  
   My friends on the other side of the aisle believe if the Federal Government is providing the money, it ought to also provide the rules as to how it is used. We think that is not the most effective way to use the money. 
   I come from Wyoming. We have some very small towns in our relatively small State. In Chugwater, WY, where I attended a graduation ceremony this week, with 12 graduates from high school, they have different needs than Pittsburgh, PA. 
   We need to have the flexibility. We say let's help make education stronger, but let the local people decide how that is done. We have been working on that. 
   Another area is economic opportunities for all Americans. We have done that in terms of tax relief. 
   Unfortunately, the bill that was passed in this Congress was vetoed by the President, denying relief for hard-working Americans. However, we were successful in passing a Republican bill that eliminated the penalty on earnings in excess of Social Security income. Instead of having to pay taxes on $1 out of $3, we have removed that, to encourage people to continue to work and earn money. 
   Another is national security. I suspect there is nothing more important. There is no more logical role for the Federal Government than defense. No one else can do that. Over the last several years, this administration has not adequately funded defense. Now we have to do that, particularly since we have a volunteer service. There has to be some attraction to that. There has to be an attraction to get men and women to go into the service and, maybe even more difficult, once they are trained to doing things, to work as pilots or mechanics or whatever, to keep them there. That is very difficult. So we have made some progress in that area. 
   I think there are a lot of things that have been done. I mentioned Social Security and taking care of the surplus. I think that is a real plus for this Congress, that we have a budget surplus. For the first time in probably 40 years, we have a budget surplus. We are not spending Social Security money. Indeed, this time there will be, hopefully, more money than is necessary to conduct the business of the Federal Government. 
   Of course, several things can happen with that money. One, we can make sure we start to pay down the debt. I mean pay down the debt with real dollars, not simply putting in Social Security dollars there as well. We stopped the raid on the Social Security fund and began to make some reduction in the debt that we have. The interest on that debt has been almost the second largest item in the Federal budget for a very long time. We can change that. Of course, if that is done, and done properly, we can move on to some tax relief, which I think is something we ought to do. 
   I mentioned our efforts on elementary and secondary education. We also were able to take the first step in passing the Ed-Flex program which, again, provides more opportunities for local people to use those Federal dollars as they need them. Some schools need capital construction, some need computers, some need more teachers or smaller classrooms, but each school district has a little different need. We want to make sure they have an opportunity to make that decision. We also need to ensure the money is not spent by the bureaucracy in Washington but in fact finds its way to the schools on the local level. 
   Overall tax relief is still something we need to do. We have done a great deal on that so far and can do substantially more. 
   I mentioned what we did on Social Security, and we need to go further. 
   On national defense, the Senator just before me was talking about missile defense. Certainly, we need to continue to explore that. We need to continue to have a strong military. In my view, that is our best chance for peace in the world--to continue to have a strong military. 
   I had the good fortune a couple of weeks ago to visit the Space Command in Colorado Springs. I am impressed with what they are doing to find a way to have a missile defense program that will allow us a deterrent so we can move forward with other 
   kinds of things. We were successful, and I believe we acted properly, not ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty so we could continue to test our weapons and make sure they are as they should be. 
   We have made some real progress in trade. The African trade bill is out there. It was signed into law in May. We can do something with that. Yesterday, the Permanent Normal Trade Relations for China was passed by the House and will be over here now. I happen to be the chairman of the subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific rim. I do believe certainly we have to verify the things happening in that area of the world, but there is good evidence we can make more progress bringing about change by being involved as opposed to isolating and seeking to stay away from that. So certainly there is a great deal to be gained there. 
   We have made some progress in high tech. The Y2K bill was an important piece of legislation, and the Satellite Television Improvement Act, particularly for rural States where people do not have access to cable. It has not yet been completed, but we have made some real movement on that. We hope to have that completed so people all across the country can have the same opportunities, both in satellites and TV, and also, of course, in infrastructure for high-tech broadband coverage. We are moving forward on the opportunity to do that. We must move in that direction. 
   Health care is an area on which we have to move forward. This Senate has passed a Patients' Bill of Rights that would provide for patients in HMOs to have some immediate referral, so if there is a question about the procedures, rather than having to go to court or having someone in an office far away decide what you can do, you have an appeal to a physician as to what that ought to be. Unfortunately, that bill is still in conference, but we think it will be out very soon. 
   One of the things we have done in this Congress that was particularly important was the Welfare Reform Act--of 1996, actually. This Republican Congress passed that. We have helped people find jobs, helped people move into opportunity instead of dependency. That is something I think has been very useful to all Americans. 
   We have a ways to go, of course. We constantly have things to do here, as we should. On the other hand, we have also moved forward and made a good deal of progress in this Congress. We have an opportunity to do more. As I mentioned, unfortunately, we have come to kind of a slowdown here, using the techniques, using the process to force issues. What it really does is slow down everything we do. 
   There is clearly an opportunity for differences of view; that is what this place is for, to talk about differences, to disagree, if you please, as to the role of Government and what ought to be done. But the idea of using irrelevant issues to hold up progress on the things we all know we have to do--and I am particularly talking about the appropriations bills that obviously have to be passed. Frankly, we are anxious to get them done early so we do not run into the same problems we had several years ago where we could not get it done and had to put it all in one package at the end. The President then used that as leverage on the Congress. He threatened and, indeed, did shut down the Government to be able to force things through this Congress that the Congress did not want to do. We should not let ourselves get into that position again, certainly not this year. 
   Mr. President, I am expecting other Senators to come for this time period. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in introducing the ``Medicare Fairness in Reimbursement Act of 2000,'' which specifically addresses the current payment inequities of the Medicare program. I am pleased to have worked with Mr. HARKIN, Mr. CRAIG, and Mr. FEINGOLD in crafting this bill for rural Medicare beneficiaries. 
   This bill directs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a payment system for Medicare's Part A and B fee-for-service programs that guarantees each state's average per beneficiary amount is within 95 percent and 105 percent of the national average. The reason for this seemingly drastic action is because the current payment disparities between states is unacceptable. According to 1998 data, Wyoming's per beneficiary spending is 36 percent below the national average of $5,000 while some other states receive almost 36 percent above the national average. 
   Mr. President, I understand that there are some legitimate cost differences among states in providing health care services to our seniors, but I do not believe there is justification for an inequity of this size. Seniors in Wyoming and other rural states have paid the same Medicare tax over the years as beneficiaries residing in urban states. However, the current Medicare payment system does not reflect the equal contributions made by all seniors. 
   The other section of this legislation requires the Secretary to make adjustments to the hospital wage index under the prospective payment system after developing and implementing improved methods for collecting the necessary hospital employee data. 
   I believe this legislation is an important piece of the overall Medicare reform puzzle. I feel strongly that any final legislation approved by the Senate to ensure Medicare is financially stable for current and future generations must also ensure all beneficiaries are treated fairly and equitably. Mr. President, the current system is not only far from long-term solvency, it is far from fair, especially to seniors living in rural states such as Wyoming.''

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I rise along with Senator ENZI to submit a concurrent resolution allowing for the placement of Wyoming's second statue in Statuary Hall. 
   As many individuals from Wyoming know, Chief Washakie was a true warrior and statesman. Chief Washakie was born in 1798 and actively participated in the cultural and historic events that shaped the West before passing away in 1900. The value of his life experiences--which span three separate centuries--still resonate in my home state today. 
   Chief Washakie, a skilled orator and charismatic figure, was widely known for his ability to foresee what the future held for his people. As Chief of the Shoshone tribe for fifty years, Washakie was successful in protecting the interests of his people in the face of westward expansion. In 1868, Chief Washakie was instrumental in the signing of the Fort Bridger treaty--which granted the Shoshone more than three million acres of land in the Warm Valley of the Wind on the Wind River reservation. His legacy lives on today as many of his descendants continue to be involved in tribal matters throughout Wyoming. 
   It is fitting that Wyoming has chosen Chief Washakie to be honored in our Nation's Capitol. This resolution not only speaks to his achievements but also commemorates the very spirit on which our great country was founded.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this morning I listened to my friend, the Senator from North Dakota, talk about what we ought to be doing in the Senate. I must tell you I couldn't agree more that we need to be moving forward. I also must tell you I have a totally different view as to why we are not. 
   We have actually been seeking to move forward for some time. The Republicans have had a number of critical issues out here that the American people are interested in--marriage tax penalty relief, tax relief in other areas, farming, education, and critical needs of the men and women in the armed services. But, unfortunately, as each of these things has come up, we found ourselves being stopped from moving forward either by unrelated amendments or objections to moving forward. I really think we should analyze where we are and what we are seeking to do. 
   In my view, in general terms, what is happening is that there is more of an interest, particularly on that side of the aisle, in simply trying to create issues rather than create solutions. Each time we bring up a basic bill, we come back to amendments that have already been dealt with, and they insist on dealing with them again. 
   The majority leader is trying to deal with a number of issues. One of them, of course, is education. We are dealing with the whole question of elementary and secondary education. We are blocked by that side of the aisle from meaningful educational reform. We are trying to deal with the idea of moving forward with the kind of funding the Federal Government can provide for elementary and secondary education. 
   There is a difference of view. Yes, indeed, we have a difference of view. The basic difference of view is to the extent the Federal Government is involved in the funding of local schools. Those local schools, their leaders, the school boards, and the counties and States ought to have the basic right to make the decisions as to how that money is used. I think it is pretty clear that the needs are quite different. 
   Yesterday, I spoke at the commencement of a small school in Chugwater, WY. The sign on Main Street said ``Population 197.'' There were 12 graduates at this school. They come from, of course, the surrounding agricultural area. I can tell you that the educatioonal needs in Chugwater, WY, are likely to be quite different from those in Pittsburgh. The notion that in Washington you set down the rules for expending the funds that are made available in Federal programs we do not think is useful. I understand there are differences of view. 
   But I guess my entire point is that we are always going to have different points of view and we should have an opportunity to discuss those and opportunities to offer alternatives. But we have to find solutions, and we have to move forward. That is why we vote. That is why there is a majority that has a vote on issues. But the idea that you have a difference of view and, because you don't get your view in, it is going to stop the process is not what we are talking about. 
   Education, of course, is just one of the areas. There is the question of the marriage tax penalty and the question of tax relief and tax reform. But, quite frankly, more than anything, there is the question of fairness--where a man and woman can work at two jobs before  they are married, earn a certain amount of money, and continue to work on those jobs and earn the same amount of money, but after they are married they pay more taxes. The penalty is approximately $1,500 a year. We have been 
   fighting to change this for a very long time. President Clinton pledged in his State of the Union Address in January to reduce those taxes. It would be a very large tax reduction for American families. However, we still have the playing of politics on the floor and that bill has not yet passed. 
   We will be seeking to do some things in agriculture. I agree with the Senator from North Dakota on some of the agricultural issues. We have been trying to deal with crop insurance. We have been trying to get that done. It is certainly something that ought to be done as we move forward towards more of the marketplace in agriculture. It has not been done because we have had objections on the floor. 
   I have to tell you we have had, and continue to have, a record of obstructionism that I think really needs to be reviewed and resolved. It took five votes before we could break the Democrat filibuster and pass the Ed-Flexibility bill in 1999. 
   Do you remember when the Republicans offered the lockbox idea where we were seeking to ensure that money which comes in for Social Security would be in the Social Security fund and not be expended on non-Social Security ideas? It was opposed six times by Senator Democrats, even after it had been passed in the House the year before by a vote of 416 12. In Roll Call, which is the House paper, in May of 2000, the Senator from Massachusetts promised to eventually work with his colleagues on the education plan. But then he was quoted as saying: We will do that when AL GORE is elected President. We will all sit down next year and have a consensus. 
   I don't think we are here to seek to establish those kinds of issues for Presidential elections and ignore what we can do here. We are sent here to resolve problems, to deal with them, and come to solutions. They have been out there on the floor. But, unfortunately, the whole idea of obstructionist tactics seems to be where we are, and we need to change that. 
   There are a number of issues, of course, that are of particular concern to people from the West, including myself. We have had a great deal of activity in the administration with regard to public land management. All of it seems to be oriented towards the effort on the part of this administration, on the part of the President, and on the part of the Secretary of the Interior to develop for themselves some kind of a legacy--a little like Theodore Roosevelt, apparently. 
   There are a number of things that have to do with access to public lands. Here again, it is quite different, depending on where you live in this country. In Wyoming, for example, 50 percent of the land is owned by the Federal Government and is managed by the BLM or by the Forest Service or by the Park Service, and it is a good operation. In some States federally-owned land is as high as 86 percent. 
   It is quite different when we start to deal with the public land issue, of course. It is sometimes dealt with quite differently in the West than the East. That is proper. We have been faced with a number of things that make it very difficult to have access available for the people who own these public lands. We are dealing, for instance, with the operation of the Forest Service and 40 million acres of road lands. I have no particular objection to taking the road lands. We don't need roads everywhere, but we need to do it on an area-by-area basis to see what needs access. 
   Sometimes the accusations suggest we help timber producers or grazers. 
   The fact is, we have heard from veterans who can't walk 17 miles with a pack on their back. If we don't have road access, they are not able to use the forests. We have heard from children, as well. 
   The administration puts out a block pronouncement that we will have 40 million acres of wilderness, without knowing what the plans are, without including Congress in the process, without holding hearings or providing an opportunity for people to respond. There was nothing there to respond to. Hopefully, that will be changed. 
   The Antiquities Act provides an opportunity for the President to declare large amounts of land for different uses and restricts uses exercised readily by this administration over the past year and a half. The BLM has a plan not to allow off-road use of BLM lands. We have bills before the Congress setting aside a billion dollars a year for the additional purchase of Federal lands on a mandatory basis as opposed to going through the appropriations. These are all designed, it seems to some, to reduce access to lands which are not only there for recreation, not only there for the use of everyone, but certainly there is a large impact on the economic future of States in the west. 
   We plan to have a hearing this week after a pronouncement from the Park Service that all parks will no longer allow the use of snow machines by winter visitors. Yellowstone Park and Grand Teton Park are in Wyoming. Many people in the winter enjoy these unique scenes on snowmobiles. The Park Service, without hearings, without input by the Congress or by anyone else, has announced there will be a total cancellation of the opportunity of people to visit their parks in the wintertime. 
   Again, I have no objection to taking a look and changing some rules. Some of the machines have been too noisy, some machines have excessive exhaust. But they can be changed. Rather than finding an alternative for people visiting the parks, which belong to them, this administration simply says we are not going to allow their use anymore and ignores alternative techniques. Also, it ignores the fact it has been going on for 20 years in most parks. 
   We could separate cross-country skiers from snow machine operators and require through EPA that the machines be quieter and less polluting. Instead of seeking to manage them, we have been ignoring this for 20 years, and suddenly they abolish their use. I hope we have a hearing this week to take a look at how that might be resolved so people will still have the opportunity to visit facilities that belong to them, facilities that are unique, facilities that should be available to be used by whomever wishes to use them properly, hopefully, year round. 
   My friend from North Dakota mentioned the sugar program, one that needs to be examined and discussed. We have had large newspapers, including editorials, that have not told the story fairly. They talk about a program that has caused consumers to pay more for sugar than they would otherwise. I don't believe that is factual. The fact is the world price for sugar is not a world price established by the market but is a dump price from countries that have subsidies for sugar. When they have an excess, it goes in at a lower price. If we are going to talk about the program, we 
   ought to be discussing facts. That information ought to be mentioned. 
   The sugar program has not been subsidized. The costs to consumers have not gone up but have gone down. The costs to producers have not gone up but, indeed, have gone down. We have a program that has worked. 
   My point is it is necessary to understand the purpose of the program, what it is designed to accomplish, and then do what is necessary in the interim to ensure that purpose is nurtured. 
   I think there are many issues we must cover. We have 13 appropriations bills with which to deal. We have approximately 60 legislative days remaining for the Senate to complete its work. We have 13 bills with which to deal. The appropriations, of course, are very much the basis for what we do in the Federal Government. There are all kinds of issues. But the amount of money provided and the way it is spent has a great deal to do with what we are doing in the Congress, what kinds of programs we are involved in, how much the programs cost, how much we want to invest in the programs. Right now, it has a great deal to do with what we do with overall revenues that come into the Federal Government. 
   Indeed, as it appears, we have a surplus. We have to make some tough decisions as to how much government we want. How do we divide the government between the responsibilities accepted and taken on at the Federal level as opposed to those taken on at the local level. The fact that there is money certainly is an encouragement to again expand the role of the Federal Government. Many believe that is not  the proper way to proceed; We ought to do the essential things. 
   Clearly, there is a difference of view about that. There is a difference of philosophy. There are those who genuinely believe the more money that can be spent through the Federal Government, the more it helps people, and that is what we ought to do--continue to always increase the size and activity of the Government. 
   Others, including myself, believe there are essential finances for the Federal Government to carry forth, but the best way to do it is to limit that Federal Government to allow local governments to participate more fully, to allow people to continue to have their own tax dollars. 
   The longer I am in Washington, the more I am persuaded the real strength of this country does not lie with the Federal Government. Obviously, it is essential. Obviously, it is important. Functions such as defense can only be performed by the Federal Government. 
   Communities are shaped by things people do through local government or voluntarily. These mean so much to the strength of communities. We have a program called the Congressional Award Program in which young people are urged to take on community activities. We give out medals. It is wonderful to see the activities in which the young people become involved. It is wonderful to see themselves in the future as doing volunteer things, as becoming leaders, taking the risk of leadership, and spending their personal time to strengthen that community. 
   We do have real differences of opinion. That is why we are here. We have a system for resolving those differences. Not everybody wins these debates. Some lose and some win. It is not a winning proposition to obstruct progress. I think that is where we find ourselves. 
   I hope the leaders and Members on both sides of the aisle will take a long look at our position. We need to have a system where everyone with different ideas gets to present their ideas, but we have to do it in an organized way, 
   where the amendments are germane to the issue. Now we find ourselves with some amendments--gun control amendments, for example, as important as they may be--that come up on every issue. It stalls what we are doing in terms of the basic generic purpose of that discussion, invariably coming up with the same kinds of amendments over and over. I think we can find a way to resolve that. I think we should. We have a great opportunity to move forward on a number of things, whether it be education, whether it be Social Security, whether it be tax relief, whether it be strengthening the military. These are the kinds of things that are so important. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Levin amendment on the military construction appropriations bill. Of course, the Levin amendment is designed to strike the Byrd-Warner provision, which I support. 
   I suspect that most of the things that could be said have been said. We find ourselves saying them again, perhaps in other ways, or simply committing ourselves to our views with regard to this issue. 
   Clearly, it seems to me, there are two issues involved. 
   One is the role of Congress. What is the responsibility? What is the obligation? What is the authority of the Congress in terms of committing troops for long terms in places around the world? 
   The other, of course, is a policy question of an exit strategy for Kosovo. That has been a question in a number of places where we have been recently. 
   It comes, I suppose, as no surprise to my colleagues that I view the Kosovo foreign policy as sort of an oxymoron--that it actually has not been a policy. We went in. Indeed, that was one of the things that concerned me the most in the beginning. There was not a strategy. We did not have a plan for where we would go. Indeed, that has proven to be the case. We didn't articulate the goals as to where we were, nor what the responsibilities would be among our allies, and, of course, the length of time to be there complicates that. 
   We have seen an unbridled passion for involving the United States in peacekeeping operations around the world. I believe that has begun to overtax our military capacity. We have military people deployed in many places. 
   There is no better or worse example of that than Bosnia and Kosovo. There we have not had a strategy as to when we complete our job and who, in fact, takes the leadership role. I agree with the Senator from Wisconsin. We had an example in East Timor where we shared the responsibility with others in the region. Indeed, in that case, Australia took the lead. We were very supportive, as we should be. 
   The idea we need to have a major role both in the activity as well as the financing in each of these areas is one that needs some specific examination. Certainly the European Community has done some work there. They are very capable. It is not as if we are talking about Third World countries. We are talking about two of the world's most vibrant economies. 
   Another reason I question the involvement, again, as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, we asked questions when this first came up and we were told certainly we would not be in Bosnia more than 18 months. How many years have we been there? We were told we were not going to be in Kosovo. 
   We have to come to some decision. The question arises, What is the role of the Senate? I believe the Senate is responsible in terms of spending the money, in terms of authorizing long-term commitments. We should step up to the post and express our views. We now have the opportunity to do that. We could also question, as I mentioned, the whole idea of our level of involvement in places where we are with allies. We would certainly have the capacity to do much. 
   I am concerned about the constitutional implications of the President's actions. Clearly, the President should have, and does have, the authority to move when there is a case of an emergency. That is as it should be. But the fact is, in both Bosnia and Kosovo, we didn't have the opportunity. Did we vote? Yes, we voted after the troops were there. Certainly no one is going to vote against the support for troops who are already committed. I remember meetings held in Ohio and the original talk about Bosnia and Kosovo. We asked: What will we do? They said: We can't tell you yet; we have to go to Europe and have a meeting there. We asked: What is our commitment? Well, we can't tell you yet. Before the Congress had an opportunity to do anything, the troops were there. We were committed. Clearly, we were going to support them. 
   This idea of an exit strategy, and certainly the idea that we have a role as Congress, as a responsibility to the people of the United States, to do that, is the question. I am not concerned that we are making a judgment ahead. That is not the case at all. We are setting guidelines. We say if those guidelines are not appropriate in that time, then the President can come--whomever the President might be--to the Congress and say there have been changes; here is what I am supporting, and with the support of Congress can go forward with something different. 
   Byrd-Warner gives a clear plan to work with the European Community and, in fact, turn some of the full responsibility over to the European Community whenever it is appropriate. Byrd-Warner gives us that. We need to ensure that the community is not reneging on its promises regarding its  share of 
   reconstruction funds. That is important. That should be done. 
   Finally, it puts us on a track, a flexible track, for exit and moving our troops out of that situation. That is what we ought to do. Certainly, it was mentioned on the floor that preserving peace in Kosovo is important. That is not the issue. The issue is how do we do that. Everyone knows it is important to have peace there. I think we can do that through this system. It will solve both the constitutional question and the question of direction. 
   I urge my colleagues oppose the Levin amendment and support the Byrd-Warner amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to visit just a little bit, maybe express some frustration about what we are doing here on the floor and mostly what we are not doing here on the floor. It seems to me, we, of course, are here for a reason and that is to move bills forward. There is not going to be unanimous understanding or agreement on all these bills, but we have a system. We can have a reasonable debate and vote on them. But the idea that each time we bring up some issue that then we are going to bring back again, issues that are clearly raised for political purposes only and hold up the progress of this entire body, hour after hour and day after day, that begins to be a bit trite. It seems to me that is the direction we are taking. Our friends on the other side of the aisle seem to be perfecting this procedure, and we move forward at our own risk, knowing we are going to have a blocking activity going on. 
   Republicans are trying to move forward with some issues for the American people that are very important: marriage penalty, tax relief, farm assistance, education, critical needs of the men and women in the armed services, and all of the 13 bills we have on appropriations that are before us. What we have had and what we are continuing to have is Senate Democrats trying to tie up the Senate by changing the subject, by attaching irrelevant amendments to every bill that comes to the Senate floor. 
   It took five votes before Republicans could break the Democrat filibuster and pass the Ed-Flex bill in 1999. It took five votes in order to deal with an issue that said local school boards, local governments could have more flexibility in what they do with Federal money. Is that something to hold up? I don't think so. 
   When Republicans offered the lockbox legislation in 1999 to protect the Social Security trust fund, Democrats opposed it six times. Senate Democrats even opposed a measure that passed the House last year by a vote of 416-12, when we were talking about taking Social Security money and insulating it from expenditures on non-Social Security matters. Tell me that is a reasonable thing to do. 
   On April 13, Senate Democrats blocked a marriage penalty relief bill from continuing through the legislative process, a bill that is based largely on fairness. It is based on the notion that a man and woman, each working singly, earning a certain amount of money, when married earn the same amount of money and pay more taxes. This was a way to resolve that. However, Democrats were rejecting a discussion of the marriage penalty tax. In the House, the Democrats joined the Republicans 268-158 to pass relief. President Clinton pledged his support of the marriage tax penalty relief in his State of the Union. But still they block this because they want to bring up some amendments that are irrelevant to this issue, bring them up totally for political purposes. Unfortunately, we find ourselves in a position of being more interested in raising issues than seeking solutions. That is too bad. That is a shame. It is terribly frustrating, frankly. 
   I just came from a meeting. We could not have a hearing this afternoon because our friends objected to having a hearing. We had people who came all the way from Alaska to testify. So I can tell you we went ahead and had a meeting and listened to what they had to say. I do not think that is the way we intended for this body to function. We disagree? Of course, we disagree. Different views? Of course, we have different views. 
   On May 4, Rollcall recounted that one of our friends on the other side promised to work with his colleagues on an education bill if we could do it. Unfortunately, he decided to change in the middle of the stream and we did not go forward. 
   Now we have 13 appropriations bills that must be passed. Really, our destination, our purpose, was to pass those before the August recess so we would have that out of the way and could deal with other things that are important. By the looks of it, we will not be able to move forward in that important area. 
   It is very difficult. We just spent 2 days working on military construction. I do not think anybody would argue that we need to move forward on the military; we need to strengthen the military; we need to do something about strengthening the opportunity for people to belong to the military and at least not to be on food stamps. We could do that. But, no, we have to get off on something totally irrelevant, an issue--whether it is gun control or whatever--that we have already dealt with. It keeps coming up on every issue. 
   I do not argue with the difference of view on it, but to use those things to keep us from moving forward and do the things we ought to be doing is disruptive and is not the intended purpose of what we do here. 
   There are only 65 legislative days remaining for the Senate 
   to finish its work. Yet we continue to find obstruction; we continue to find delay. 
   Military construction finally got through. We spent all that time talking about something totally irrelevant to it. We had to get off on the thing. Yesterday we did nothing all afternoon, basically. We finally got it passed. I am pleased with that. I, frankly, voted against it. I voted against it because I did not agree with the process. I do not have any argument with what was in it. 
   Education had to be pulled, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, probably the broadest issue with which we will deal. It touches almost everyone. Almost everyone agrees we need  to do something with that. Could we finish it? No, we sure couldn't. Sure, there is a little different view. We wanted to let the local people have more flexibility. Our friends over there wanted the rules to come from here. OK, we have a difference. We have a difference in philosophy. I don't argue with that. We have an honest difference. Let's vote. But, no, that is not what happened. What we did was have introduced all kinds of irrelevant, nongermane amendments. I don't know how long we can do that. 
   The marriage penalty--I have already mentioned it. That is something that certainly ought to be done. As far as I know, it is agreed to by nearly everyone, including the President. It is a fairness issue. We ought to be doing it. 
   Agriculture, crop insurance, that is one of the things we need to strengthen, since we are moving away from the old farm program. Agriculture is out there; farmers are running some risks and crop insurance is part of it. We were not able to do that. Things that were not pertinent were there. 
   The juvenile justice bill, we passed juvenile justice. It is still in the committee. We are trying to get some agreement. It is being held up by nongermane kinds of things. 
   I respect fully the difference of view. I respect fully the differences in philosophy. That is why we are here. That is what elections are about. I understand that. But we simply have to find a way to put aside this business of stalling, just put aside this business of delay, put aside this business of constantly seeking to bring to the floor issues that are totally political and have nothing to do with the topic we are on and talk about them at the time to talk about them. But talk about them once. Don't talk about them every other day. That is what we do. That is wrong. We ought to change it. 
   We have a chance to take a look at where we are and where we want to go. I have thought more recently, I don't know quite why, about the concept that each of us has goals for ourselves, whether they be personal goals, whether they be professional goals, whether they be spiritual goals, whether they be family goals, and seek to identify those 
   and then decide what our goal is and what we have to do to reach it. 
   Frankly, I wish it applied a little more to Government. As we enter into these, we ought to not only be looking at the daily issues with which we deal, but we should also be looking at, having set goals and identified where we want to be, whether what we are doing now is contributing to the attainment of those goals. 
   It is my view we have not done enough of that. If we have a goal of accomplishment in the Senate, a goal of doing the things the people sent us here to do, and then find ourselves caught up in business which does not move toward the attainment of that goal, it is frustrating. 
   I hope we can move forward. I believe we will. I appreciate the Presiding Officer's efforts. I look forward to next week to accomplish more than we did this week. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator from Arizona. He obviously believes very strongly in this issue and has defined very clearly where we are with two very definite points of view. One is that the Federal Government ought to make the rules, ought to set up the redtape, ought to make the decisions here to be implemented in the country; the other is to send the assistance from here to local schools so they can make the kinds of decisions that are necessary to make their schools successful. 
   So I say to the Senator, thank you very much.

   We have had an interesting week of debate. A number of things, of course, have helped define where we are and the direction we will take. One of the quotes from the other side of the aisle is the reason we have title I is because we decided in 1965 the needs of disadvantaged children were not being addressed. 
   Madam President, 35 years later, we find once again, the needs of poor kids are not being addressed--this time, by those who defend the status quo, the means of trapping another generation.

   Mr. THOMAS. I am excited that we are launching ourselves into what may be a week or more of debate and discussion and, hopefully, success in the area of education and educational funding. 
   Looking back over time, I think there is probably no other issue we have talked more about than education. I think polls and discussions in  town meetings would indicate that education is probably the highest priority issue in the country. 
   Everybody knows the future of our children--and of the country--depends on education. We will be talking about that during debate of this bill, and I hope we can agree on some positive results. 
   Unfortunately, I think it is fair to say that when we enter into a year of this kind, particularly with the Presidential election, we find ourselves faced with more emphasis on creating issues than creating solutions. I hope that is not the case during this education debate. 
   I am sure there is nothing to which we have more commitment or in which we have more intense beliefs than our schools--by ``we'' I mean all of us: Parents, communities, people all over the country. We are all involved in educating our children. It is a most important part of our lives. 
   This weekend, I met with the alumni association of the University of Wyoming. It caused me to reflect on the things that were basic to my life and reminded me of changes that need to be made. 
   I think most of us are proud of our schools. I am especially proud of the schools in my State of Wyoming. They are rural schools, generally, that are relatively small. The population in our State is low. But when those kids come here to visit, through programs such as Close Up or others, when they come here to serve as interns or come here to serve in the Senate, I am very proud. Our education system must be doing well for these young people to be here. 
   Can we make it better? Of course. That is what we are challenged to do, to make an even better opportunity for our children. We need to be able to help our schools to be flexible enough to change, as the world changes, as our economy changes. 
   Again, going back to this weekend, we were talking about the relatively small number of young people who have graduated from the University, or even from our high schools, who are equipped with the kind of technological expertise they'll need as we enter this new economy. We need to make sure they're ready to answer the call. 
   As the Presiding Officer has said so eloquently, we are coming forth this week with an educational agenda. I think it is a very strong agenda. It is the product of much work on the part of the committee that is bringing it forth. It tends to emphasize moving controls to parents. After all, that has really been the controversial issue we have addressed in all of our conversations; that is: Where should the decisions be made? Who really should fit the educational program to the community and their needs? 
   By all means, we need to reflect on it and measure it against the rest of the country, especially since our population is becoming much more transient. For example, a person living in Cody, WY, as I did, may not live there forever. We have to have some relative comparison between schools, which we do have. But we need to tailor those programs, particularly Federal assistance, to 
   fit our specific needs. 
   Educational needs in Meeteetse, WY, are much different from those in Pittsburgh, PA. We need to make sure the Federal dollars--and it has already been pointed out it is a relatively small amount, about 7 or 8 percent of the total--are used in the classroom and not set aside for the bureaucracy. 
   We need to give families more of a role in education with greater educational choice. 
   This morning, we had a visit from a RespectTeen group. I brought them onto the floor. There was one student from each State. A young man who had been chosen to come here had done a study and a paper on education. His paper focused on the importance of family involvement in schools. I was very impressed with the ideas about ways to get parents more directly involved with the education of their children. 
   We need, of course, to support exceptional teachers. We need to help teachers be prepared to teach. We need to encourage people to come into that profession. We need to provide attractive opportunities for them to stay in that profession. I guess I am especially interested in that since my wife is a teacher. 
   But it is very important to focus on basic academics. 
   That is what we aim to do. We have an opportunity to make some changes, to set some goals and some objectives. I am afraid that, too often perhaps, individually, and certainly institutionally, we become wrapped up in doing the things we are doing and, as a result, do not sit down regularly and ask ourselves: Where are we? Where do we want to go? What are our objectives? What do we need to do to get there? 
   I think we can fairly easily define the goals we want to accomplish in education. But I am not sure we define very well how to make the process of achieving them more effective. 
   We also need to address the issue of accountability. We spend a great deal of money in education, which we need to do. However, frankly, money alone does not ensure a good education for our children. We have seen the results of simply throwing out money and not having some system of accountability. 
   What we have had in this administration is a commitment to a whole series of Federal mandates and programs--for example, 100,000 Federally funded teachers. It has already been pointed out this morning that there are school districts in which providing additional teachers to reduce class size is unnecessary. The needs are in other places. That is why priorities need to be decided locally. Sometimes the mandate is for Federal construction. Again, that need may exist in one place but not in another. 
   So what we are really talking about is having some accountability, having some local flexibility, helping disadvantaged children meet higher standards, improving teacher quality, enriching the incentives for students to be prepared for a life of success, having safe and drug-free schools--we can do more in these areas. 
   Increasing educational opportunities is what this bill is all about. This is not a proposal for private school vouchers, but it does give an opportunity for mobility. 
   If these kids are in a school that is not adequate, they can go to another public school and possibly improve. 
   I think it is exciting that we are moving ahead. I hope we can do so with the objective of passing a bill that will strengthen education in this country. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am sure we welcome everyone for ``Take Your Daughter to Work Day'' here in Washington. 
   I will take a few minutes to talk about the marriage penalty tax bill that is before us. Speaking of daughters, this provision of the tax code makes it difficult for young families who have daughters to be treated fairly. 
   Before addressing the specifics of the bill before us, I must say that I am a little disappointed in the lack of cooperation this year on the floor. Each time we address an issue with a solution that is generally acceptable to most people, we find ourselves faced with all kinds of amendments, many of which have nothing to do with the subject we are seeking to address, designed entirely to create political wedge issues rather than solutions. I suppose that is customary, perhaps, in a Presidential election year, but it is too bad. It is too bad that each time we begin to talk about an issue that should be addressed by this Congress, and indeed is generally agreed to by most Members of the Senate, we find it being used to bring up issues that are not relevant, not a part of what is being discussed, but simply are used to delay, used as leverage, used to make an issue. I hope we can get by this resistance. 
   One of the items we will be addressing early next week is an education bill, a broad education bill, elementary and secondary education, one that most everyone in the country wants to see moved forward. Education is probably one of the principals issue with which all of us are concerned. Yet I predict that we will find next week all kinds of irrelevant amendments will be added to seek to confuse and delay the passage of legislation. 
   I hope that is not the case. I hope it is not the case with what I think is a very important issue, the marriage penalty. All of us are concerned about our tax system, concerned about how complex the tax code is. Certainly right after April 15, we are all very aware of how excessively complicated this system has become, designed to affect behavior as much as it is to collect revenue. 
   One of the things we ought to consider, as we seek to simplify taxes, is fairness. That is the situation we face today with regard to the marriage penalty. The Federal Government penalizes couples simply for being married. Two people earning this amount of money jointly, unmarried, become married and pay more taxes on the  same amount of income. That is not fair. That is what we ought to be dealing with, the fairness issue. 
   Last year, 43 percent of married taxpayers, 22 million couples, paid an average of $1,500 more in taxes than they would have paid had they not been a married couple. In my State of Wyoming, 45,000 couples were affected by this tax situation, a high percentage of our population. Marriage penalty relief is middle-class tax relief. We always hear it is for the rich. This isn't for the rich. This is for middle-class people who become married, as we urge people to do and then, indeed, they are assessed a penalty. Middle-income families are the hardest hit. 
   What does marriage penalty relief mean to families? Fifteen hundred dollars for families would mean a semester of community college, 4 months of car payments, clothes for the kids, a family vacation, a home computer, several months of health insurance premiums, or contributions to an IRA or a savings program, which we encourage people to do. 
   This country finds itself, thankfully, with more than adequate funding for Federal programs, even after we have ensured that Social Security is not used for operating funds. This prosperity is due in part to the Republican Congress' ability to control spending. Now, for the first time in over 40 years, we have an opportunity to begin to pay down the Federal debt, while also providing tax relief, because of the excess money coming into 
   Washington. 
   You, the people of this country, must decide if this is the appropriate course to take. Do you want to spend more money? Do you want to have more Government involvement, more Government regulation, or should we give this money back to the taxpayers who have paid it in? It is your money after all. This bill is an opportunity to do that. If your intention is to control the size of the Federal Government, tax relief is a very good idea. If you keep the money, I guarantee it will be spent on expanding the size of Government. 
   An editorial that ran a while ago in the Wyoming Tribune-Eagle called on Congress to do something about the marriage penalty. I will a small portion from it:  
   While the tax system is unfair, Congress's lack of action is even more unjust. Members know there is a problem but refuse to act. That is shameful.

   Mr. THOMAS. I could not agree more with that sentiment. It sums it up very well. This vote will clearly highlight those who want to do something about the marriage penalty, who want to do something about tax simplification, tax fairness, and those who do not. We will see those who want to use this legislation simply to introduce extraneous issues, knowing that those issues will not be resolved, but, rather, can be used as issues in the political campaign. 
   Marriage should be a sacred event, not a taxable one. We have a bill that will do something about that penalty. I urge all my colleagues to support the cloture motion so we can move forward and implement this much needed tax relief. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I rise in support of Senator GRASSLEY's Sense of the Senate Resolution urging President Clinton to see to it that the Department of Justice reprogramms $10,000,000 in recovery funds within the Community Oriented Policing Service (COPS) so the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) can continue to reimburse state and local law enforcement officials in the proper removal and disposal of hazardous materials recovered from clandestine methamphetamine laboratories. 
   Mr. President, Wyoming is one of a number of states that has experienced an astronomic increase in methamphetamine production, trafficking and use. In fact, during fiscal year 1998, of all cases prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's office in Wyoming, 45% were drug cases and of that nearly 75% were methamphetamine related. 
   When law enforcement officials bust a methamphetamine laboratory not only do they have to prosecute the individuals involved but they must also dispose of the highly toxic chemicals that were used to produce this illegal drug. It is estimated that it costs between $3,000 and $100,000 for the safe clean up of methamphetamine labs. It is very important to see to it that methamphetamine labs are properly handled because six pounds of toxic waste are produced for every pound of methamphetamine manufactured. 
   Wyoming's law enforcement officials rely exclusively on the funds that the DEA provides to state and local law enforcement officials for the clean up of methamphetamine labs. Because of this growing problem, the allocated funds the DEA uses to reimburse state and local law enforcement officials ran out last month. As a result, numerous towns and communities across the country are no longer able to rely on the DEA for much needed funding. 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that President Clinton will see to it that the Justice Department approves this reprogramming of funds so law enforcement officials across the country can continue to fight the growing problem of methamphetamine production.

    Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, on March 15, 2000, Gene R. ``Rocky'' Roccabruna retired as Director of the State of Wyoming's Department of Transportation. Mr. Roccabruna stepped down from his position after rendering more than 30 years of outstanding public service. I regret his departure in the sense that it is indeed a loss to both the agency he headed and to the traveling public at large. But at the same time, I wish to extend, on behalf of my state's Congressional delegation, our gratitude for a job well done and our sincerest wishes for a long and happy retirement. 
   Mr. Roccabruna's retirement represents a milestone in Wyoming highway history as he was the last active Department of Transportation employee whose association with the agency dated back to the beginning of Interstate Highway System in 1956. After starting as an engineer trainee, he earned steady promotions and soon was in charge of multi-million dollar highway construction contracts. Several sections of Interstate 80 were built under his supervision and that road has since become not only Wyoming's busiest highway but a major artery for transcontinental commerce as well. 
   Mr. Roccabruna left the employ of state government to start his own contracting business but later returned and went on to hold several managerial positions within the Department of Transportation. His reputation grew along with his responsibilities. He became widely recognized for abilities as a good listener and consensus builder. For these and numerous other good reasons, Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer appointed him in December 1996 to head the Department, which is the largest Wyoming state agency. During the past three-plus years, I, Senator ENZI and Representative CUBIN, and our staffs, have had numerous opportunities to work with Mr. Roccabruna on many important state and national transportation issues. His advice was particularly valuable when we helped craft the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, and his contributions will provide benefits well into the future. While I look forward to a continuing good relationship with the Wyoming DOT under its new director, Sleeter C. Dover, I take this opportunity to again say thanks to Mr. Roccabruna for dedicating so much of his time and talents to making transportation more efficient, more enjoyable and safer for Wyoming residents and the entire traveling public.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is my understanding our focus this week will be on the budget, as it should be. One of the things, of course, that is very necessary is to address the budget each year, and one of the things we haven't done that we should do, and are doing this year, is to address the budget early so we don't find ourselves at the end of the session being sort of at the mercy of the President, who can kind of put the leverage on us to do what he wants us to do or else suspend Government operations and, of course, blame the Congress, which has happened before. 
   In any event, when we are talking about budgets, it is easy to get off into the detail. That is what we will have to do. My friend from Nevada talked about the plans for spending, and that we will have the budget come up, and that we have fortunately, for the third time in 40 years, some extra money--a surplus--in the operating budget. So many, particularly on the other side of the aisle, are searching for ways to spend the money, which is fine. But it seems to me that the responsible approach we ought to take and the approach I believe most Americans want us to take is to evaluate where we are with respect to Government, what the role of the Federal Government is in these various policies, and to make a determination as to what expenditures ought to be made that are consistent with what we believe to be the legitimate role of the Federal Government. 
   We need to talk about an analysis of that because what happens for the rest of the year is pretty much guided by what you do in terms of the budget--unless, of course, you simply ignore the budget later on. I hope that is not the case. So we ought to be talking in the areas that will be under consideration. What is the role of the Federal Government with respect to the private sector? What is the role of the Federal Government with respect to local and State government? What role should be played there? It seems to me that that is basically where we ought to begin having made that decision, of course, which won't be unanimous because there is a good deal of philosophical difference as to where we ought to go. 
   There are those who believe the more money you can spend on behalf of the people by the Federal Government, the better off you are. There are those of us who don't agree with that. Some believe the role of the Federal Government should be limited, that we ought to do the things that encourage people to do things, give them the ability to do things for themselves, and leave many decisions with the people in local and State governments. I agree with that. 
   We ought to be doing something specifically for Social Security. The President has been talking for several years about ``let's save Social Security.'' But he doesn't have a program at all to do that. Just to say ``let's save Social Security'' isn't the proper approach. Indeed, we have ideas on this side of the aisle as to what we ought to do. Clearly, there are three options as to what you do to make sure the young people now paying in from their first paycheck 12.5 percent will be able to have benefits when the time comes to do that. One is 
   to raise taxes. Very few people are for that. Another, of course, is to reduce benefits. Very few are for that. The third option is to take that account and make it a personal account for the person who has paid in the money, and allow, on their behalf, for this money to be invested in the private sector in equities or bonds or stocks so that the return on that trust fund will be much higher than it is now and the benefits will be there. 
   We talk about paying down the debt. It is a great idea. We have done very little of that over time. We have a $5 trillion debt. This generation and preceding generations have spent it, and we are going to leave it up to others to pay for it. We have paid down the debt some with respect to taking Social Security money and putting it over there in place of publicly held debt, which is a positive thing to do; the costs are less. Really, to pay it down, we ought to be taking some of the surplus out of the general fund and putting it over there. Frankly, we don't do that unless we have a plan to do it--something like a mortgage in which we say over 15  years, or whatever, we are going to pay that off. Then we can take so much every year to do that, and we are dedicated to doing it. That is not the approach taken by the administration. 
   There is great concern about tax reduction. I certainly believe we ought to take care of adequate spending, protecting Social Security, paying down the debt, but then what is wrong with tax reduction? That is where the money came from. Just because there is more money coming in as a result of a stronger economy doesn't mean we necessarily have an obligation to spend it, which is what the other side often says we ought to do. Much of the tax reduction is just a fairness issue. For instance, the marriage tax. Why is it that two people who are making a certain amount of money as two single persons get married and they have to pay more taxes on the same amount of earnings? That is very unfair. Part of what we talk about in tax reduction is a matter of fairness. Part of it is also incentives to do other things. 
   So we will be talking about the Republican budget that will be coming before this Congress, in which we safeguard Social Security, shield Medicare, pay down the national debt, and at the same time work on the fairness issue. We will be protecting that surplus by not spending it, which is unique, only happening in the last several years. It strengthens Medicare by increasing--as we did last year and again this year--some of the reductions that were made in the balanced budget amendment. We will reduce the national debt, hopefully, by using operational funds to do that, as well as Social Security dollars. We will provide tax fairness for families. We need to do that. We need to balance the budget again, as we have for about the third time in 40 years. So that is a very good thing. 
   This budget, over time, reduces the debt by $177 billion, wipes it out over 13 years--if we stay with this budget. That is the kind of commitment we ought to make. We talked about tax reduction. Think about what it is. This budget would provide about $150 billion in 5 years in tax relief to American families--over $13 billion next year alone in the form of marriage penalty relief which, again, is a fairness tax. In the form of educational assistance now, is reducing taxes a bad thing if we are going to--increase the health care deductibility? I don't believe so. We are seeking to provide more coverage for people--without making a total government program out of it--by giving some kind of tax relief to do that. 
   I think this is going to be a very important debate and an important discussion. I understand there will be differences of view. That is what this body is all about, talking about different philosophies. There will be different philosophies, such as saying the more spending we have, the better government is and the better off everyone is. That is a point of view. I don't happen to share it. I think there ought to be limitations on the size and role of government. We ought to be building opportunity instead of doing those sorts of things. 
   I think we have a great opportunity to do some of the things we have talked about for years; that is, to reduce the debt, to secure Social Security, and to provide some incentives for people to do things for themselves. 
   We have the opportunity, and we will be doing it this week. I think we ought to take into account not only the dollars that are there, and not only the specific expenditures, but how we envision the role of government over time. How does that fit into the idea of freedom and opportunity for all? What is the role of a government in that? 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pending second-degree amendment, of which I am a cosponsor. 
   First, I thank the Senator from Texas for his good work in getting this bill moved forward. We remember that this came up last year when we talked about the local-to-local broadcasting, and so on. The Senator--properly, I think--suggested it be sent back for more consideration by the Banking Committee. Indeed, it was. He promised us at that time that this bill would come forward. He has adhered to that promise and is out here with it now. 
   The other thing on which I agree with the Senator from Texas is that he has divided this responsibility and there is an 80-percent guarantee. I agree with that. There needs to be someone who has some risk and promises that there will be more attention paid to it. I have agreed with all those things. 
   What we are talking about is being able to include a not-for-profit financing organization that has been involved with rural telecommunications, that has been involved with rural electric, and, indeed, serves the rural area. Very appropriately, that should be considered. 
   By the way, this is the Cooperative Finance Corporation, not the Commodity Finance Corporation that has been mentioned a time or two. It is not set up by the Feds. It is a private co-op without Federal support. 
   CFC is adequately capitalized, so it has actually better ratings than most of those banks. 
   Furthermore, as we talk about the requirement that might include increased costs to rural electrics--rural electrics, by the way, with which I am rather familiar, having worked in that area before I came to the Senate--they can get their financing other places; they are not captive borrowers from the CFC. 
   I think this second-degree amendment is one that simply provides more opportunity for this unit, this nonprofit unit, owned by rural people, to participate in the financing of an effort to provide rural television, local-to-local television, 
    the kinds of coverage we now do not have in Wyoming. If you want to see ABC, you have to get your program from California or from Chicago. We are saying we can provide that locally so you can get local news, local information. We think that is very important. Of course, that is what this bill is all about. 
   The proposal that is before us and that we seek to second degree places the burden of proof to show that the lender's ratings will not decrease. Under the proposed amendment, this board would need to predict what the financial condition is going to be. That is a pretty unreasonable requirement for this governmental board composed of Cabinet officers or their designees. 
   Secondly, of course, Wall Street rating agencies make these kinds of ratings, and they will be making it here. This, after all, is a market function. CFC raises its capital in the private capital markets through the sale of bonds, through the sale of equity securities, equity investments. So these things are all a function of the market and are tested by the market. We don't need to set up an artificial organizational effort to do that. 
   CFC is over 31 years old. I think it has $600 million worth of capitalization. They have been in the energy and telecommunications markets. They are mature. What we are saying is that we appreciate very much the Senator's willingness to allow these kinds of nonprofits to participate, but our argument basically is there are restrictions and regulations here that are not needed. They are additional bureaucratic reviews that are not necessary in order to accomplish the purpose the Senator has set forth. 
   I won't take longer. I am very much in favor of this bill. I hope we will move to pass it quickly. I thank Senator JOHNSON and Senator GRAMS for joining in this effort to make some changes. I do not think they changed the policy direction that the Senator from Texas takes, and I urge the support of the second-degree amendment.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to come back this afternoon--I  talked some this morning--to talk about this bill. It is a very important bill to us. It is one that provides an opportunity for us to have local television in rural areas. There is great support for this idea. We are trying to find a way to put it into the proper perspective in terms of the lending of money to guarantee loans that will cause this to happen--I agree with the chairman--where we have 80 percent of a loan guaranteed by the Federal Government, but that the remaining 20 percent be done in the private sector without further guarantees by the Federal Government, by the taxpayers, so there is that sharing of risk and that incentive to continue to be very careful with these kinds of expenditures. There is no question that this is a somewhat risky operation, something that is new and technically different. 
   The conversation we are having currently, of course, is to provide an opportunity for CFC, the Cooperative Finance Corporation, to be a participant. CFC was formed in 1969 by the Rural Electric Cooperatives and provides private capital. I have worked with it a great deal, having been manager of a rural electric association in Wyoming for a number of years. 
   CFC was not created by the Federal Government and does not receive Federal funds. This is a private corporation. CFC has 31 years of experience in lending to rural electric systems, and since 1987 has provided more than $3 billion to rural telecommunications projects. 
   Our Wyoming rural electrics, starting 15 years ago, were involved in bringing satellite TV to rural consumers and have been doing that from a programming standpoint. Unfortunately, we could not get our local stations, and that is what this is all about. This is something the rural electrics have been involved in for some time. 
   CFC is AA rated. It has $16 billion in loan assets. Over 31 years, CFC has had only $77 million in losses and has loss reserves of $235 million. 
   This is a strong organization and one that is capable of doing this work. Furthermore, it is owned and operated by citizens, by rural people, by boards of directors of the rural electrics, by people who are elected to serve. 
   What we want is to give an equal opportunity for this unit to give loans and to participate as well as others. 
   CFC has backup lines of credit with 50 banks. These lines of credit amount to about $5 billion. This is a large group. We have heard some information about the allegation that a loan loss by CFC will result in rate increases to 25 million consumers. I think that is very farfetched. I do not believe it is accurate. 
   If CFC incurs a loss, CFC, as a private corporation, will incur the loss, with no liability to the Federal Government. 
   If CFC incurs a loss and its interest rates increase, rural utilities are free to borrow from other lenders, including banks and other finance companies. 
   Co-ops are not responsible for repaying CFC losses or obligations. What we need to do, of course, is to ensure they are treated like others in the private sector. But this idea 
   that they somehow have a special advantage in that any losses can be passed on to rural electric consumers in the electric business is not true. We have heard a great deal about that. 
   The bottom line is, in the worst case scenario, CFC's rates could increase and co-ops would then borrow from other entities. 
   CFC is a private cooperative. It is paternalistic to set up this private organization to have people governing under the rules of private sector and private enterprise and to suggest the Senate ought to design for them their rules. I reject that idea. 
   I am happy to say we are seeking to find some language that will satisfy the need to move forward with this bill and also to provide an equal opportunity for CFC to participate without unwarranted supervision. I am hopeful we can find that arrangement. 
   We ought to make that discipline work. I think we can, and I certainly look forward to working with others this afternoon so we can pass this bill and move toward rural communications and local-to-local communications. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I will take a very short time. I speak in favor of the flag protection amendment to the Constitution. It is an honor for me to be a cosponsor of this constitutional amendment, 1 of 58. Most everything has been said, I suppose, that needs to be said about it. Of course, no one here is in favor of desecration of the flag. What we have is a difference of view as to how to deal with that issue. 
   This constitutional amendment has been around for a very long time and has been considered several times. Certainly, this symbol of the flag is one that should be held in the highest regard. Most everyone agrees with that. 
   This measure states:  
   The Congress shall have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.  
   That should be the case. It seems to me what that does is helps to define freedom of speech. We can do that. 
   What we are saying is it is illegal to physically desecrate the flag of the United States. I cannot imagine how people can disagree with that. The Senate has voted on this matter in the past in 1989, 1990, and 1995, and each time a majority was in favor. The House passed an identical measure in June of 1999 by a vote of 305-124 with a sufficient majority. Each year we get a little closer to passing it.  
   Why do we need a flag protection amendment? Forty-nine State legislatures have already passed resolutions urging this constitutional amendment. The flag, obviously, is a sacred symbol and deserves protection from desecration. It is a symbol of national unity and identification. We all know of the sacrifices that have been made, and this flag typifies that; this flag is symbolic of that. It is an inspiration for people. 
   The attempts in the past have failed in terms of statutory issues. The Supreme Court struck down the Texas v. Johnson in 1989 in a 5-4 decision. In 1990, there was another 5-4 decision. 
   This is a reasonable request to accommodate and I believe most Americans want to protect this flag. If this is the necessary way to do it, then I am for that. 
   I am very pleased to be a cosponsor, and I urge this be passed in the Senate. I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coal Market Competition Act of 2000. The legislation would amend the Mineral Leasing Act to increase the acreage of coal leases. Companies need this assurance as they plan and finance their operations into the future. Now, more than ever, we need to diversify our Nation's resources. The current oil prices are a daily reminder of what occurs when we allow this country to be too dependent on foreign resources. It is time to focus on domestic energy production and this legislation will facilitate development of one of our Nation's abundant natural resources, coal. 
   Most of the coal produced in our Nation comes from mines west of the Mississippi River and the vast majority of that coal is mined in western states with significant federal ownership of both the surface and mineral estates. In fact, my state of Wyoming is home to 11 of the top 12 coal mines based on tonnage. We produced approximately one third of the total U.S. coal in 1999, with production exceeding 330 million tons last year. Not surprisingly Wyoming is also the leader in federal coal lease acreage with approximately 145,000 federal acres under lease to 20 companies. 
   The current federal coal lease limitation under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 is 46,080 acres per state. An amendment of the Mineral Leasing Act in 1976 maintained the per-state limit and added a 100,000-acre nationwide limit for any one company. The state coal lease limit has not been changed for 36 years. Coal, sodium, phosphate and oil and gas were all assigned identical or similar per state lease acreage limitations in the 1926 amendments to the MLA (2,560 acres per state for sodium, coal and phosphate, 2,560 acres per geologic structure and 7,680 acres per state for oil and gas). The acreage limitation for each of these minerals was increased in the 1946 and 1948 MLA amendments (coal, sodium and phosphate to 5,120 per state in 1948; oil and gas to 15,360 acres per state in 1946). The per state acreage limitation for oil and gas leases was increased twice more (to 46,080 acres in 1957 and 246,080 acres in 1960) and the per state acreage ceiling for coal (and phosphate) leases was increased once more to 46,080 acres (and 20,480 acres for phosphate) in 1964. In my view, it is time to address the coal acreage limitations both on a state and national level. 
   The cap on coal needs to be raised to allow producers to remain competitive in the world-wide market. In Wyoming, the coal mine sizes will need to increase in order to maintain economic competitiveness. Our coal industry has grown and prospered because its economic competitiveness allowed Wyoming to be the location of choice for new low-sulfur coal capacity to serve much of the world. The scale of mining operations is much larger now. 
   In order for this competitiveness to continue, we must raise the acreage cap to alleviate concern from several companies in both Wyoming and Utah about the effect of the limitation on their planning and production abilities. Larger lease acreage areas are required to justify the significant capital investment necessary for mine expansion. Under current leasing operations, the penalty for violation of the acreage limitation is lease cancellation. It is essential during a time like now--when oil prices are soaring--that we diversify and develop our Nation's energy sources rather than be dependent on foreign sources. Expanding lease acreage will allow coal to be competitive and it is essential we have choices for energy here at home.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wish to talk a little bit about oil prices. I guess most everyone wants to talk about oil prices and gas prices at the pump--those things that affect each of us. First of all, I have had the opportunity to meet in the Chamber this morning and hear a little discussion about taxes. So I will comment for a moment on that. 
   We are now dealing with the budget, which of course is one of the basic responsibilities of Congress, and the question of how much money we spend in the Federal Government. That has to do with the whole philosophical question of how large a Government we want and the things we want the Federal Government to be involved in, how much involvement we want in all of those things--what is the division between the responsibility of the Federal Government, local government, and State government. I think these are obviously some of the most important issues with which we deal. These are broad issues. These are philosophical issues. The budget has a great deal to do with it. 
   In fact, I suspect that the total amount of expenditures is probably the most important issue we deal with all year, depending on how you view the role of Government. Keep in mind this year we will spend about $1.8 trillion. That is $1,800 billion in the Federal budget. About a third of that will be so-called discretionary funding, which is determined by the Congress. The remainder, two-thirds of that, $1,800 billion, will be mandatory spending--  things such as Social Security, Medicare, and others. 
   We are dealing with setting a budget that basically is an expenditure limit on that discretionary spending, which last year, as I recall, rose about 7.5 percent more, much more than inflation. This year I think there is an effort being made to see if we can control that level of spending. It has to do with the size of Government. Clearly, everyone has different views, of course, as to how to adequately fund programs we think are most important--the priorities the public sets through their representatives in terms of Government programs. 
   One of the things it seems to me we haven't done as well as we might is to review programs that have been in place for a very long time. Some of them, obviously, are important programs that need to go on. Others were designed to do something for a relatively short time, but they are always there. They never go away because we do not have the opportunity to have the oversight to see if, in fact, those programs have accomplished the things they were designed to accomplish, and if, indeed, those dollars can be spent more productively in some other programs. 
   We find ourselves in a situation of having these programs that have been in place forever and are almost automatically funded and the obvious need for new programs from time to time as time and needs change. It is simply an accumulation of programs. Those of us who occasionally say to ourselves that we ought to control the size of Government, have to take a look at those kinds of issues. 
   I hear my friends talk about the evils of tax reduction. They ought to review that a little bit, it seems to me. 
   First of all, we ought not spend Social Security dollars for operating funds. We have been doing that for 40 years, but we have not done that in the last 2 years. We hear our friends on the other side of the aisle and the administration and 
   President Clinton saying: Save Social Security. Not one program has come from them as to how to do that. 
   These young pages sitting here will pay out of their first paycheck 12.5 percent for Social Security. The likelihood is, if we don't do something, that they will not have benefits when they are eligible for them. 
   We need to do something. We have a plan. We set aside at least a portion of that for individual retirement accounts. Let it belong to the persons who made it, and, indeed, let them invest in private sector equities or bonds so that the return is much higher. 
   The choices we have are fairly simple. We can reduce benefits. Nobody wants to do that. We can increase taxes. I don't know of anybody who wants to do that. Social Security taxes are the highest that most people pay of any tax. Or we can increase the return for the trust funds. We are for that. The administration has no plan at all other than to say: Save Social Security. 
   We need to do something about paying down the debt. Most everyone would agree with that. The debt that the President brags about paying down is taking Social Security money and putting it into debt. It would be replacing public debt. But it is still debt. It is debt to the Social Security trust fund. 
   What I propose and what I think we ought to do is set money aside just like with a home mortgage, and each year we will take so much money. It will take this amount of money to pay this year's obligation to pay off the debt in real dollars. So instead of being replaced by Social Security dollars, that debt is being reduced. That is what we are for. The President has no plan. All we hear is this great talk about it but nothing is happening. 
   Then, quite frankly, we talk about taxes. What we are talking about, at least to some extent, is not simply reducing debt. It is a fairness issue. The marriage penalty tax is a fairness issue. Why should two people who work independently and are married pay this amount of tax? That isn't fair. 
   It is a fairness issue. It is not just tax reduction. 
   There are ways to change the estate taxes. The Presiding Officer has a proposal that estate taxes ought to be paid when they pay taxes as a matter of capital gains. Good idea. Then there is money left, unless one continues to spend it. 
   People talk about taxes and balancing the budget and the economy growing starting in 1993. I am sorry, it didn't start in 1993; it started in 1991. It has been going on for a good long time. I cannot imagine the President's tax increase has contributed a great deal to the economic growth. 
   People have different views. That is what it is all about. We have different views of how we best serve this country. There are many views. 
   We talk about energy. Thirteen leaders of the OPEC nations are meeting in Vienna to discuss boosting oil production. I appreciate the efforts of Secretary Richardson. I hope the answer is they will increase production. That is a good thing to have happen. 
   We have to talk about how we got ourselves in a position of having to go over to OPEC, saying: We have real problems; will you help us out? And then we do not get much of a response from the very group we have contributed so much to, not only in dollars but in the gulf war. Then we find them deciding whether they will do us a favor by increasing oil production. 
   How did we get where we are? I think we have had a lack of a policy regarding energy, not only in petroleum but in the whole sphere of energy. I come from the largest coal-producing State. This administration has made it increasingly difficult to produce energy as it has sought to close down energy powerplants because of maintenance. 
   We find ourselves depending on others and that puts at risk not only our economy but also our security. We find ourselves now in the neighborhood of 57-percent dependent on foreign oil. We see consumption going up each year; domestic production is going down at the same time. 
   What are some of the reasons? Some are what have happened in the last few months in terms of this administration which has set about to leave a ``land'' legacy--and I understand Presidents desire to have different legacies. This is called a land legacy where they will set aside more and more private lands and put them into public ownership to have a billion dollars a year they can spend at their own discretion without going through the process of Congress and appropriations to acquire more Federal lands. 
   In my State of Wyoming, nearly 50 percent of our land belongs to the Federal Government. Selfishly, it makes a lot of difference if the land can be used as multiple-use public lands, if we can protect the resource, protect the environment, but also use those lands--whether for hunting, for recreation, for grazing, whether it be for coal and gas production. We can do these things in such a way that we have multiple use as well as protection of the environment. 
   This administration has moved in a different direction. I have been on the Energy Committee since I came here in 1994. We have not had from the Energy Department a coherent policy on energy for a very long time. We had a meeting this morning on 
   the Kyoto treaty, the meeting in Japan where we were supposed to sign a treaty which would reduce our energy by about 40 percent, while asking less of the rest of the world. Of course that has not been agreed to. As a matter of fact, this Senate voted 95-0 not to agree to it--not that we shouldn't be doing something about clean air, not that we shouldn't be doing something to reduce the effect of economic growth--but not to just sign a treaty that says we are going to put ourself at a disadvantage. 
   This is part of where we are, including access to Federal lands, where we have 40 million acres, using the Antiquities Act, to set aside other lands for single purpose uses. We have had for some time offshore oil drilling, one of the great opportunities to provide domestic oil. We have tried from time to time to do something to give a tax advantage for marginal oil wells so they would produce, but the administration is opposed. 
   We talked about looking at ANWR, to do something in Alaska, to provide more domestic oil so we are not totally dependent on foreign countries to provide that energy source. That is not only good for the economy and jobs, but it is a security measure. 
   Since 1992, oil production is down 17 percent in the United States; consumption is up 14 percent. In just 1 year under this administration, oil imports  increased almost 8 percent; they are now getting close to 60 percent. DOE predicts a 65-percent oil dependency on foreign oil by the year 2020. We have become even more dependent. 
   The United States spends about $300 million each day on imported crude oil, $100 billion each year. We are concerned the trade deficit from oil amounts to about one-third of the trade deficit. Now we are looking at short-term issues when what we have to do is take a look at the longer term resolution to these problems. 
   The policy that would change this, and one we look forward to, is increased access to public land, continuing to emphasize, however, the idea that we need also to protect the environment. We can do that. 
   I mentioned tax incentives that would increase production. We need to look at the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act which is being used to reduce the use of lands as well. It has a real impact to a lot of people in my State which is largely a State that has mineral production. 
   In 1990, U.S. jobs exploring and producing oil amounted to over 400,000; in 1999, these jobs are down to 293,000, a 27-percent reduction in the ability of America producing our own oil. In 1990, we had 657 working oil rigs; now it is down to 153, a 77-percent decline. 
   I think we need to take a long look at where we are and where we want to go. Any government looking at energy has to recognize the stewardship responsibility that we have for the environment. We do that. At the same time, we have to be able to produce for ourselves so we have the freedom and opportunity to continue to have the strongest economy in the world, the greatest for jobs, while strengthening our security. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are here, of course, to talk about oil prices, high oil prices that affect each of us. Let me start by recalling that less than 2 years ago, in 1998, we had what was considered to be the largest oil collapse since 1900. The price of oil in my State, which is heavy oil and less expensive than some other places, was $5 or $6 a barrel. Now, of course, we are faced with oil prices that are in the neighborhood of $30 a barrel. 
   I think we will hear a great deal of talk that we need to find a long-term answer to stabilize the production cost of energy so we have, in fact, an ample amount of energy. We need an incentive to produce energy on a continuing basis so the price is relatively stable. 
   I have talked to a number of the producers in my State, and production is still not as high--there are not as many wells, not as many pumps--as it could be. We say the price is as high as it has ever been, but there is no assurance it will continue, so you are hesitant to invest the money you have--a great deal of money, as a matter of fact--when you do not know if that price is going to be back where it was before. So what we are talking about basically is some kind of policy that would bring about some stability in fuel prices.  
   I thank Senator MURKOWSKI, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, for his interest and leadership in this matter. Why this has happened is no real surprise. There are a number of things, frankly, that have happened over time, and this administration cannot be surprised that we now have energy prices that are impacting truckers' diesel fuel prices, that are impacting seniors, that will have an impact on the tourism economy in my State of Wyoming and in agriculture, and certainly in many places in home heating. 
   It is not a surprise this has happened. We need a long-term energy policy. We need tax relief for low-production wells. We need commonsense royalty collection. We need access to public lands for a multiple-use concept and to develop oil and gas and coal. 
   By the way, the Senator from West Virginia spoke of coal. Certainly, that is very important as well. Wyoming is the largest coal producer in the Nation, low-sulfur coal. We are very pleased with that. 
   There will be opportunities for quick fixes. Certainly we support the idea of Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Programs, for example. But the fact is, over time, we will need a policy that is not just short- but rather long-term so we can get away from this idea that we are going to be threatened in both our national security and our fiscal security from time to time because of this. 
   Part of it is regulatory. EPA has tried to shut down coal-fired powerplants in the U.S. when all they were doing was routine maintenance. Coal supplies 55 percent of the Nation's electricity. A third of that is produced in Wyoming. 
   There is an interchange between energy uses. Of course, you do not use coal in the car, but you can use coal in some places where you could then release the oil for transportation. 
   Lots of things are occurring. The Secretary of Interior, Mr. Babbitt, is talking about taking down hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest. We have had substantial limitations on the use of public lands in the West particularly. Vice President GORE has promised to prohibit future exploration for gas in the Outer Continental Shelf, places where we could do this and at the same 
   time protect the environment. 
   We are into this whole question of nonaccess to public lands. It is part of this administration's idea of the land legacy, where we have now 40 million roadless acres in the forest. We have BLM roadless areas that keep us from using the multiple resources. Interestingly enough, the access thing goes so far as national parks, where now there is a policy in winter use to keep people away from the access to Yellowstone Park but at the same time promote the burning of nuclear waste upwind from the park, and have no concern about its impact. Interesting. 
   A failed domestic policy is certainly what we have. It has already been mentioned that, since 1992, U.S. production is down 17 percent; consumption is up 14 percent. In just 1 year of the Clinton-Gore operation, oil imports increased 7.6 percent. It is now at 56 percent and growing. It will be up as high as 65. 
   The United States is spending $300 million a day importing crude oil, $100 billion a year. One-third of the trade deficit is based on the importation of oil. 
   So these are the kinds of things with which we are faced. We certainly need a long-term policy. As I suggested, we need to take a look at the Rocky Mountain States. We need to take a look at Alaska. We need to take a look at offshore opportunities, tax incentives to help oil production get started, exploration costs. 
   Yesterday, I cosponsored a bill introduced by Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON from Texas on marginal well credits. I think these are the kinds of steps we can take--incentives, of course, trying to make regulations that do not inhibit production moving forward. 
   We have a lot of things to do. There are some real impacts, in addition to the costs. In 1990, U.S. jobs exploring and producing oil involved 405,000 people. In 1999, jobs exploring and producing oil and gas were down to 293,000--a 27-percent decline in the production of energy. 
   I think there is a great deal we can do, but the overriding demand is to have a long-term policy which helps us to increase our domestic production so we are less reliant on overseas oil. American families should not have to bear the full cost of this failed energy policy. In the long term, I hope the administration will embrace Congress' efforts and we will move forward. I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. The Senator is correct, of course. There are a great many things that could happen. We have low-sulfur coal, which is very clean, but it is relatively low Btu. You can do some things to enrich the Btu's. One of the problems is transportation. We have this great coal now that costs us less than $5 a ton. That is what it is worth at the mouth of the mine. 
   But if you take it then to Fort Worth, TX, it is $25 because of transportation. You could transport many more Btu's if you would do this enrichment. 
   Fifty percent of Wyoming belongs to the Federal Government. Some of it is set aside, of course, and should be, as wilderness. Some of it is set aside in forests and lands that need special protection. But much of the land is high plains lands, and so on, that can be used for multiple use, can be used for production. Frankly, it has been made so difficult. We have had such a hard time with royalty payments, these kinds of things that really are unnecessary. 
   The Senator from Alaska is right. We can do a few things to encourage domestic production and really take us out of this kind of a proposition.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to improve the implementation of legislation that Congress passed in 1998, the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act. 
   It has been 45 years, since President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued Bureau of the Budget Bulletin 55-4, proclaiming, ``It is the policy of the Government to rely on the private sector to supply the products and services the Government needs.'' 
   Why is it, then, the Federal government has identified some one million positions on its payroll that are commercial in nature? As the author of the FAIR Act, I had hoped that my legislation would have put into place a process, albeit 45 years later, to substantively implement Ike's policy. 
   Despite almost a half-century of policy that ``the Federal government should not start or carry on any activity to provide a commercial product or service if the product or service can be procured from the private sector'' more than 100 agencies have released FAIR Act inventories identifying some one million commercial Federal positions. Of these, 440,000 are in civilian agencies and more than 65 percent have been exempted from potential outsourcing. In the Department of Defense, 504,000 non-uniformed positions are considered commercial, but 196,000 or 39 percent are exempt from outsourcing. 
   The first year experience with the FAIR Act raises fundamental questions. If it has been the Federal Government's policy for 45 years to rely on the private sector for commercially available goods and services, how did we get to the point where despite claims of ``reinventing government,'' ``the smallest Federal workforce since the Kennedy Administration'' and other political rhetoric, we have one million Federal employees engaged in commercial activities? How is it that of those one million positions, roughly half will not even be studied to determine if government or private sector performance provides the best value to the taxpayers? 
   The FAIR Act was intended to shed sunshine on the Federal Government's commercial activities. Its purpose was to tell the American people what its government does and put in place a process to determine how to best get the job done. Unfortunately, implementation of the law has fallen short of these expectations. 
   The law requires agencies to inventory activities and positions that are not inherently governmental. Inventories are published so that interested parties, both public and private, can challenge inclusions or omissions from the list. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has overstepped its authority by creating a series of ``reason codes'' that enable agencies to declare activities commercial but exempt from potential outsourcing, and then declaring such reason code designations outside the challenge process. As a result, 482,000 positions, roughly half the government's entire FAIR inventory, has been declared commercial, but exempt from potential outsourcing, public-private competition, or challenge. That is wrong, inconsistent with the law and down right un-FAIR. 
   Manipulation of the process has also cast a long shadow on the sunshine Congress was seeking. Take for example the Department of Energy. Of 11,765 commercial positions on its inventory, just 618 are ``commercial competitive.'' Within the agency's Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), 1,263 of the agency's 2,267 commercial positions were classified as ``management'' and of these 1,259 were considered ``commercial, in-house core,'' exempt from  further review. Unfortunately, DoE is not alone in gaming the system. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which has 4,500 employees, has inventoried all its positions in just two categories. 
   These practices, too, are un-FAIR, particularly for federal employees. How can BPA or Corps of Engineers' employees tell if their positions are slated for potential outsourcing? How is the private sector to determine if the positions the Corps has on its inventory involve management of campgrounds, integration of their computer systems, designing a dam, mapping a flood plain, or painting the walls of an office building if all these activities are aggregated into two broad categories? These actions fail to shed sunshine and render the FAIR Act challenge process moot. 
   The FAIR Act also requires a ``review'' of commercial activities that survive the inventory and challenge process ``within a reasonable time.'' The Act's legislative history clearly demonstrates Congress intended for such a review to be either direct outsourcing or a public-private competition similar to that envisioned in OMB Circular A-76. To date, OMB has not issued guidance on how it will implement such reviews, nor has it established a timetable. 
   Due to OMB's dismal performance thus far, it is clear that Congress will have to pass a package of FAIR Act amendments to make sure the job is done right. Today I introduce legislation to do just that. 
   This legislation is largely technical in nature but the major provisions would improve the accuracy and usefulness of the inventories, make sure Federal employees are notified when their jobs appear on the inventories, fortify the review process, require a report on the portability of federal employees' pension benefits, ban federal agencies from performing any commercial activity for other federal agencies or state and local governments unless a cost comparison is conducted and prohibits the conversion of any activity on a FAIR Act inventory to Federal Prison Industries. 
   I look forward to working with Chairman THOMPSON and Ranking Member LIEBERMAN of the Government Affairs Committee to see that this common sense legislation is enacted into law this year.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the remarks of the Senator from Alabama.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, there are lots of things we can talk about and, indeed, should talk about. The Senator from Alaska talked about the problem of fuel, the problem of petroleum costs. That is a very real issue for us, of course, and one we need to deal with. We talk about the marriage tax penalty. There are all kinds of things we must talk about. 
   There are some basic issues--and I have talked about them before--that I believe strongly in, issues that clearly are the responsibility of this body and the responsibility of the Federal Government to deal with. Frankly, sometimes it is very difficult to do that. 
   Unfortunately, I suspect that Presidential election years make it even harder than usual to do some of the things that clearly need to be done. One of the reasons, of course, is that there is a great tendency to talk about the things that can be used as campaign issues as opposed to seeking solutions. Unfortunately, that does happen. 
   The majority party, this side of the aisle, does have an agenda. I think we have a strong agenda that reflects, at least in my State, the majority of voters. I have been back home in my State every weekend this year. We talk about those issues all the time. 
   I am hopeful we can focus on those issues. I know sometimes it is difficult to get those issues on the floor. It is difficult to get them out and to find some sort of solution. I believe we have a responsibility to do that. I think we have a responsibility to do that as the majority party. 
   There are times, of course, when, if we could pass something, the President would veto it. That is his choice. Let him veto it. I think it is our responsibility to bring those issues forward and to resolve them in a way that best fits our philosophy of what we think is good for this country. 
   Certainly, there are a number of things that are very high on the agenda, such as the budget, such as the spending level and for what, in fact, the taxes are spent. Social Security, I am sure, is an issue that almost everyone is concerned about. Frankly, the younger you are, the more concerned about it you ought to be. 
   Another issue is doing something about the debt that we still have, a substantial debt that we have incurred over the last number of years and now, apparently, are expecting somebody else to pay. Another issue is tax relief. 
   These are the things we really ought to focus on; and I wish we would. 
   We talk about the budget. It seems to me, there is probably nothing more important, in terms of gauging where we go with the Federal Government, than the budget, because the budget, after all, is sort of the limitation as to where we go. The limitation is the thing that causes us to have to establish spending priorities. Of course, if you had an endless amount of money, you would not need to have priorities; you would just spend money. I do not think many people would want to do that; certainly, most taxpayers would not. 
   In the budget we have to find an amount. I think one of the things we are dedicated to, as Republicans, and, hopefully, all of us in the Senate this year, is to complete the budget and, subsequently, the appropriations, at the time set forth in the law and the time set forth in our operation here. 
   Last year, for example, we waited too long. We were here at the very end of the session trying to complete the budget. Of course, there is always controversy at the end of the session. There are always decisions to be made when you are at the end of the session. 
   It is even more difficult at the end of a session because the administration--particularly with this President--has used the end of the session as a very effective leveraging tool for the President to get what he wants; otherwise, he threatens to shut down the Government. Even though the President shut the Government down in the last experience, the Congress got the blame for doing that. 
   We need to get this thing done. We need to get it done before the first of September, and certainly before the end of September which is the end of the fiscal year. 
   We need to set the amounts so that they somewhat control growth. If you believe, as many of us do, that there ought to be some limitation to the size of the Federal Government, it ought to be constitutionally limited to those things that the Constitution provides. If you believe that most of the governing ought to take place at the local level, closer to the people, in the States and in the counties, then there ought to be some limit in growth. 
   Last year, unfortunately--and I voted against the bill--we 
   ended up with something like 7 1/2 or 8 percent growth in the budget--too much, I think. That is too much. Hopefully, we can hold it this year to no more than the growth due to inflation. 
   Of course, there are new programs that have to be funded. But there also ought to be a termination to some of  the programs that are there. It is very difficult to do that. 
   Last year, we had sort of fancy footwork which allowed us to spend more than it really seemed as if we were spending. But now, finally, of course, it comes out that we spent more. 
   In fairness, we also did some good things last year. For the second time in about 25 years we balanced the budget in operational dollars. For the second time in about 40 years, we did not spend Social Security money for the operations of Government. That is good. That is very good. Those are two things we ought to continue to do. 
   One of the other things that ought to happen--there is a good opportunity this year--is to have a biennial budget so that, as is the case with most States, we can deal with the budget every other year, which then gives us a year to have oversight. One of the most important things that Congress ought to have is oversight of the agencies, oversight of the regulations, so that we can ensure that what we have done, what we have passed, what we have put into law, is, indeed, working; in fact, as the money is being spent, the accountability is there, and so on. We could do that. Hopefully we will be able to do that. 
   It seems to me, the budget is key to managing the Government and is something we ought to be doing. Of course, the spending ought to be within the budget. We spend something like $1.7 trillion in our budget--almost an incomprehensible amount of money. Last year I think $586 billion of that was in discretionary spending. The rest of it was already set. 
   This year we are dealing with the question of, if it was $586 billion last time, how much do we spend? Do we spend $600 billion? Do we spend $630 billion? 
   It is hard. I think it is more difficult when you have the idea of a surplus than it is when you have the idea of a deficit. When you have a surplus, everybody has ideas as to where we ought to spend all that extra money. But it isn't extra money. It belongs to the taxpayers. When we have done those things we think are essential for good Government, then the surplus money ought to be used in other ways. 
   It is my belief, and the belief of many, that we ought to limit the size of Government, we ought to limit the number of things we fund, and we need to have better Government. Certainly, we can do that. We can do that in our appropriations. 
   Social Security. Almost everyone talks about Social Security. Almost everyone would agree that Social Security is one of the most important issues that we face. 
   Social Security, of course, is not a retirement program. It is a supplement, but it is very important. When I talk, particularly to young people, most of them say: I will never see any benefits. They are probably right. Unless there are some changes, the program will not sustain itself. 
   We have seen so many demographic changes. It started out at a time when almost 20 people were working for every one who was drawing benefits. Now it is about three. It will soon be two. Of course, it will be almost impossible then to provide those kinds of benefits over time. What do we do? We have to make some changes, pretty clearly. 
   There are several options. One is to increase taxes. Social Security taxes are the highest taxes many people pay, about 12.5 percent of their earnings when we take into account what the employer pays--a very high percentage. So that is not a very popular option. We could reduce benefits. Benefits are not especially high now. That is not really a very attractive option either. So the third option is to increase the return on the money that is in the Social Security trust fund. There are billions of dollars there, of course. Under the law they can only be invested in Government securities. So they bring a relatively small return. And up until now, they haven't even done that because they have been replacing debt for other purposes. 
   We have a plan that ought to be considered and put into place. The administration keeps talking about saving Social Security but doesn't have any plan to do so. I think there is a plan out there. There is a bill of which I am a cosponsor, along with others, that would, in fact, set up individual accounts and would take at least a portion, whatever portion we could decide upon, and that account would belong to you or to me. It would be there to be invested in your behalf. It could be invested in equities; it could be invested in bonds. The return would be substantially higher than it is now. Over a period of 40, 50 years, that would bring a really good return and fund the program. 
   Furthermore, if one was unfortunate enough not to use the program, passed away before they had the chance to get the benefits, it would belong to them. It would be part of their estate. I think that is a reasonable way to do it, one we ought to fully consider. 
   The other issue with which we need to deal, with regard to the budget and money, is the debt. We still have a substantial amount of debt. Part of it is privately held and part is held by Social Security dollars; part of it is publicly held. We talk all the time about reducing the debt. We did, indeed, last year put the Social Security money over there and replace publicly held debt. The fact is, when that is to be used for benefits, the taxpayers at that time will still have to bail out that money so it can be used in the trust funds. 
   What we would like to do is, assuming we have paid what is substantially needed for programs, set aside Social Security money. If there is still some surplus there, I think we ought to dedicate a portion of that to paying off the debt and do it in a systematic way, not just say, well, we will pay it off when we get some money, whatever, but, in fact, say, we are going to set aside enough money each year, as you would on a mortgage on your home, and say, in 15 years we will pay off this $3 trillion of debt or whatever it happens to be, publicly owned debt. Each year the payment on that will be in the budget. It will be 
   there. It will automatically be spent for that purpose. And over a period of time we would do away with that debt that is owned by the public and earns a substantial amount of interest. I think a couple of years ago we paid about $380 billion a year on interest out of this budget of ours to do that. I think that is one of the things we clearly could do. 
   Finally, of course, assuming there is still some left, we could, as the Senator from Alabama has said, do something about returning these excesses to the taxpayers who paid them in in the first place and certainly deserve to have them. Obviously, there are different ideas about how that is done, whether it is marriage penalty, estate tax, whether it is an across-the-board tax. The fact is, that money should go back to the people who paid it in. It is really bad policy to keep extra money in Washington because it will be spent. Once we have met our obligations, hopefully that can be returned. 
   These are the things that are clearly before us. There are many other items, of course, but these are the ones we have to do. These are the ones the American people want us to do. These are the ones people in Wyoming talk about when I am there. 
   I have to mention one other area they talk about that is a not in this category, but it has to do with management of public lands. It has to do with the so-called land legacy this administration has been working on for some time. Apparently the President, wanting to leave some kind of a Teddy Roosevelt legacy, wants to change the legacy he has before he leaves in several months, to have it be some sort of a setting aside of public resources for singular uses. That doesn't mean a lot to people who live in States where Federal lands are not a big issue. My State of Wyoming is 50 percent owned by the Federal Government; Nevada is 85 percent owned by the Federal Government, and it varies in between. 
   The things that happen in those States economically and other ways are affected greatly by the management of those lands. We have seen a number of designs to set aside lands for uses different than have been in the law. The law now provides there will be wilderness set aside, or, indeed, that they be set aside for multiple use, which means for recreation, for hunting, for scenery, for grazing, for minerals, for all kinds of things under the multiple use concept. 
   When that is not available, then the economies of our States suffer greatly, as do the long-term upkeep and availability and accessibility of those lands  for Americans. I happen to be chair of the National Park Subcommittee. The purpose of a park is to maintain resources and to provide an opportunity for its owners, the American people, to enjoy it. Now we find ourselves faced with a number of things being proposed that would limit access, limit the enjoyment of these lands: 40-million acres roadless in the national parks, for example, which has never been fully explained as to what it means. The Antiquities Act is being used to set aside lands only by action of the President. The Congress is not involved. BLM has set out a roadless plan without details; nobody knows exactly what that means. Does it mean you are not accessible to it, that there are no roads to get to it? Forest regulation--instead of having multiple uses, one of the concepts of the plan goes totally to ecology. No one knows exactly what that means. 
   We have proposals from the administration to put billions of dollars, over a $1 billion each year, directly to purchase more Federal land. In the West, we think there is a substantial 
   amount now. 
   We have a lot of things to do. I am confident we will get to them. I hope we do. I think we should. There is a philosophy, of course, that is different among Members of the Senate as to the role of the Federal Government, as to the size of the Federal Government, as to whether or not in an area of education, for example, there is flexibility to send the money, if you are going to support education, to the States and let them decide how it is used, or do you have the Federal Government bureaucracy in Washington tell people how it should be used. Frankly, whether it is schools or whether it is health care, whether it is highways, whatever, the needs in Wyoming are quite different than they are in New York and Pennsylvania. The school district in Meeteetse, WY has different needs than Pittsburgh. We ought to be able to recognize that and allow local people to be able to do that. 
   That is one of the big differences we have on this floor. The minority whip this morning talked about coming together to do things, a perfectly great idea. But as long as there is opposition to those concepts of letting States and counties participate, then it is very difficult to do that. 
   I am hopeful we will look forward. I am sure we will; that is the system. This is a great system. There are weaknesses and complaints, of course. But after all, this is the best system in the world. It is up to us to make it work. 
   I suggest the absence of quorum.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have seen in the last several months, and I suspect we will continue to see from now until the end of this administration, a considerable effort to implement programs that bypass the Congress, programs that, indeed, bypass public input into those programs. 
   We have seen a great many Executive orders regarding regulations that have had limited, if any, public input. We have seen the use of the Antiquities Act and a number of other activities of this kind. 
   It is important that we remember the constitutional requirements of this Government, that there is a division within Government. That is what the legislative, executive, and judicial branches were designed to do, and they were purposely put in place to ensure that none of the three branches developed a domineering position and became a czar of the Government. 
   It is terribly important we take a look at this in Congress; that we ensure, to the extent we can, that this does not happen; that there is, indeed, as we move forward with various programs--whether they be regulatory, whether they be legislative--an opportunity for people to participate. 
   The current regulatory system encompasses more than 50 Federal agencies, more than 126,000 workers, and annual spending of more than $14 billion in the area regulations. 
   From April 1, 1996, until March 31, 1999, Federal agencies issued nearly 13,000 final rules. Of these, 188 were major final rules that each carried an annual cost of more than $100 million in our Nation's economy. 
   The paperwork burden of these Federal regulations is approaching $190 billion annually. A recent study by the American Enterprise Institute concluded that all EPA rules promulgated between mid-1982 and mid-1996 under environmental statutes such as Superfund, the Clean Water Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, have had negative net benefits; that is, they hurt more than they helped. 
   When these regulations come into place, we hear that there is going to be a partnership, a partnership between the communities, a partnership between the State, a partnership with the Federal Government. Unfortunately, it has been our experience, particularly in the area of public lands, the partnership is a little one sided, a one-horse, one-dog arrangement, not an equal partnership.  
   One example is the clean water action plan, an Executive order establishing 111 key actions designed to improve the Nation's remaining water impairment problems. Everyone wants to do that. Imagine putting into place in one move 111 different regulatory actions, done without the NEPA process, without the process of input, without the process of having public discussion. 
   The administration has requested roughly $2 billion annually since 1998 for implementation. It has been an interesting process, particularly with EPA and the Committee on Environment and Public Works, which is taking a strong look at this and, in one instance, declared this agency had gone beyond its statutory authority. 
   One of the difficulties is, first of all, the nonpoint source idea which was never authorized in the Clean Water Act. It was only point sources which were authorized. 
   What is happening now is they have moved toward an implementation of the plan that is designed more to control the land use than, in fact, to control nonpoint source water. 
   The Environmental Protection Agency structured the plan around data that the GAO, the Government auditing organization, has criticized. In 1999, GAO cautioned the methodology used in determining both impairment levels and impacts from nonpoint source was underfunded and, consequently, results were very possibly inaccurate. 
   Specifically, GAO highlighted concerns relating to how the agency identified waters polluted by nonpoint sources, the need for more data to develop cost estimates, and the extent to which the Federal Government contributes to water pollution. 
   Instead of pulling back, having found out this information, EPA is moving forward with the implementation of the program. States and impacted industries have complained to EPA through the Congress, through the committees, that EPA's plan places a financial burden and amounts to an unfunded mandate. 
   This could be reasonable, if they went through the process of involving people before putting the regulations in place. But when the regulations are put there by fiat, certainly that is not something we expect to happen and should not allow to happen in our system of government. 
   Even USDA wrote a letter, saying when they were doing these activities in the old Soil Conservation Service, they were much more efficient. When we questioned EPA about that, they got the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture to change his mind and say: I really did not mean that at all. 
   Of course, 2 weeks ago I was in Wyoming for a week. Half of Wyoming belongs to the Federal Government. Much of our State is in public ownership. The use of those lands is vital to the economy. A multiple-use concept is what has made these lands useful, not only to preserve the environment, which can be done, but as well to be able to use them for hunting, recreation, grazing, mineral production--all the things that go together to make up an economy in the West. 
   Now we are faced with some other propositions. In this case, the Forest Service has declared by regulatory fiat that there would be 40 million acres dedicated to roadless areas. Of course, we have roadless areas in the public lands. We have wilderness that has been set aside by congressional action. By the way, when it was set aside in Wyoming, the statute also said there would be no more wilderness set aside unless Congress made that proposal. 
   It has been very difficult. We have had several hearings with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Chief of the Forest Service to determine what ``roadless'' means, whether or not it is another way of having wilderness areas. The interesting part of it is, most of the lands that have been structured in this plan for roadless areas have roads on them; they are not roadless at all. But the Forest Service has done nothing to identify or solicit cooperating non-Federal agencies in the EIS. 
   Several of our States have asked to be cooperating agencies, which is what the Environmental Quality Group in the White House has said they are going to implement in all these kinds of programs, but the Forest Service has said: No, we are not going to have the States; we are not going to have the counties; we are not going to have these non-Federal agencies participate. 
   Hearings were held. Actually, they were not hearings; they were information systems. People were invited to come, but there was no information there. They were asked to respond to something without knowing what was being done. So there was really not public involvement of that kind. 
   The other thing is that we already have forest plans in place. Each forest is required to have a forest plan. I have no objection to the idea of limited roads, but it ought to be done in a way in which people can participate, and it ought to be done in a way in which Congress can participate. We are finding more and more of that happening in this so-called land legacy that is being put forth by the administration. 
   Last week, the Secretary of the Interior announced there would be literally millions of acres of Bureau of Land Management lands that would be set aside simply for their scenic value. That is very important to western public land States, where much of that land is part of our economy. It can be preserved for the environment. However, we also have to have multiple use. Those things will go together. 
   The Antiquities Act is another. In 1996, we put into law the Congressional Review Act which requires regulations be submitted to the Congress. They are interpreted by OMB. Those that have over $100 million of value or cost are submitted to the Congress, with an opportunity to take a look--oversight--to see if those regulations are carrying out the spirit of the legislation which authorized them or, indeed, to see if in some cases they are being put into place without any statutory or regulatory authority. 
   Unfortunately, it has not worked well. The idea was to have it come to the Congress. It has to go through OMB first to decide whether it has the $100 million impact. Then it comes to the Congress, but the Congress has not had an opportunity to deal with it. 
   Unfortunately, from April 1 of 1996 until March 1 of 1999, Federal agencies issued, as I said before, 13,000 final rules. And 188 fell within this category of $100 million. Unfortunately, not one has been changed by the Congress because this bill is not workable. 
   We have to make it work. We need to create a congressional regulatory analysis group that has the opportunity to look into these bills. Much like CBO, Congress needs an entity to take a look at them. Right now, unfortunately, it does not work. I think certainly we have to do something to keep this administration from running roughshod over my constituents' interests, the Presiding Officer's constituents' interests, and others. There needs to be this balance. I think the Congressional Review Act could be that balance, if it has some changes.

   Mr. THOMAS. I yield myself such time as I may utilize. 
   Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill. The time has come for the Congress and the Federal Government to step up to do something. This is not a new issue. It has been going on for a very long time. As a matter of fact, the basic legislation--the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982--required the Federal Government to build a storage facility for spent fuel, to accept nuclear waste by 1998, to develop a transportation system, and that the cost would be paid for by the electric utility customers. The Department of Energy has not done this. The administration has not lived up to its part of it. They have been required to have a plan, but they have done very little. 
   The Federal Government has accepted the more than $16 billion collected from utility customers to do this. It has not shown results. The customers, of course, have been hit more than once in terms of paying the higher rates. 
   The time has sort of expired to continue to debate this issue, to continue to have opposition, which does not surprise me because there has not been many positive options coming from the other side of the aisle. All we have is resistance. All we have is: No, we are not going to do that. 
   This year I had the chance to go down to the nuclear storage site in New Mexico. We have spent billions of dollars there. We have moved only a very small amount into that storage spot. Idaho has not been able to use that at all. 
   Currently over 40,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel is being stored at 74 sites in 36 States. An additional 35,000 metric tons from weapons production and naval facilities increases the number of sites. 
   I understand this legislation isn't what everybody would like to have, but the fact is that we need to do something. Passing this bill will start us moving in that direction. That is what we ought to do. 
   The legislation drops interim storage, requires the Congress to approve  increases in fees collected, sets a schedule for the development of a repository, authorizes backup storage for any spent fuels, and allows EPA to set radiation standards after June 1, 2001. It does a number of things on which we need to move further. It authorizes the settlement for outstanding litigation and sets an acceptance schedule for spent fuel. I know it is a difficult issue. 
   I commend Chairman MURKOWSKI and Senator CRAIG for all of their hard work. The Energy Committee, which has approached this several times, has done a number of things. Frankly, the time for delay is over. 
   We are experiencing some of the same kind of resistance to doing something now in the INEEL situation in Idaho where we are looking very hard at some alternative to incineration. 
   I have heard from the Vice President. He said he would look into it. I have heard from Mr. Frampton from the White House who said he would look into it. I have heard from the Secretary of Energy who promised to look into it, but nothing has happened. 
   There is a limit to the amount of time we can continue to stall in making some decisions with regard to this nuclear 
   issue. 
   I urge support for this bill. I hope we can move forward with it today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to comment a little. I suppose I might have a different view than what we heard in the last 35 minutes, about what a wonderful budget we have and that we can now return to the era of big government. Not everyone is happy about that, as we might have heard over the last few minutes. 
   As we look realistically at these things, we have to look at a time that has been prosperous. It started in 1991, in fact. We moved forward. We have a surplus projected, largely because of the strong economy, of course. Also, it is a result, frankly, of a majority in this Congress that, since 1994, has held down spending. That is a little difficult for my friends to accept, of course, but we have now an opportunity to take a look at a relatively prosperous time. Certainly, we want to continue that. We want to take a look at the things that ought to be done for the people of the United States, using their tax money. We ought to take a look at how we strengthen education and return the opportunities to make the decisions about education to the local level rather than doing what the President wants to do, and that is to decide in Washington what each school district ought to have. 
   We have quite a different philosophy on how we approach this, and that is reasonable. That is why we are here, to represent different views. The things we heard this morning would all represent the idea of more Government, more Government spending, more decisions made in Washington. That is a legitimate point of view. It is a point of view of many in the minority. It is not the point of view of most of us in the majority. So that is what we will be up to, over the next several months and, indeed, this year: deciding as best we can how to come together on these decisions. 
   It was not long ago, you will recall, when President Clinton suggested in his State of the Union Address that the era of big government was over. That seems now not to be the issue at all. In fact, apparently the era of big government has returned. If this budget is put into place, that is exactly what we will see. Many think that is the greatest way to go. I think that is legitimate. So that is what the debates will be about. 
   We have before us suggestions of substantial amounts of surplus. This is the first time in 25 years the budget has been balanced. That is largely because of some controls on spending. We have been increasing spending over the last couple of years, I think amply, but still in the level of about 3 percent. Prior to that time, in the early 1980s and the early 1990s, we were expanding as high as 12 percent. That has been reduced some, and that is part of it. Certainly the President's tax increase, back in 1994-1995, had some effect. 
   Also, the tax reduction brought on by the Republicans helped stimulate the economy. We will have a lot of basic things about which to talk. 
   This is a huge budget, $1.8 trillion. What is that, 1,800 billion dollars? We will have to talk about each of the areas in which that spending will take place. 
   Basically, there are some philosophical things. If we think about  where we are going with our Government and the decisions we will be making in elections--that is what politics is about, to set the direction of Government, and we will be doing that. 
   We start with some basic things. We start with putting priorities on the role of the Federal Government and then funding those priorities. Again, not everyone will agree, but that needs to be done, it seems to me. There is no end to the way we can spend money. There are many programs on which we can spend it. I believe we can start by saying to ourselves: What are the legitimate functions of the Federal Government? What should the taxpayers' money be used for, and what are the priorities? 
   When we come to some agreement on that and, in fact, have begun to fund those priorities adequately--I just came from a breakfast with the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Having been in the Marine Corps, I was happy to be there. The defense of this country is one of the real priorities, and certainly we need to fund the military adequately. We need to fund education. We need to fund health care. There are a number of things, perhaps, at which we ought to take a long look. 
   The President has proposed 43, I believe--in the neighborhood of 40--new programs. There is a surplus, he says, so let's spend the money. Fine, but let's take a look at the priorities and see, with respect to local governments, if this is where it ought to be done. 
   Social Security: I do not think there is anyone who does not agree that Social Security is an issue that is a high priority. As I said yesterday, these young people who are starting to pay into that program will pay the largest percentage of their income for a longer time than they will pay in any other tax. Are they going to have benefits at the end of 40 or 50 years? The answer should be, yes, they will. To do that, we have to make some changes. 
   There are no proposals in this budget to make any significant changes in Social Security, other than to take something out of the general fund, which is not a long-range proposal. We have some ideas how we can do that. 
   The other thing we have to recognize, even though certainly it is a step in the right direction, is the idea of reducing the deficit with Social Security funds. We have to take a long look at that. It is a good idea, and we should put that Social Security money there as opposed to spending it in the general budget, but the fact is that we are replacing publicly held debt with some other debt that has to be repaid by the taxpayers when that Social Security is drawn out. It is less expensive as well, so it is a good idea, and it does get it out of the grasp of the Congress. 
   What we ought to be doing, if we are serious about the debt, is instead of spending more, we ought to be saying: Let's take a certain amount of that money out of the operating funds, decide over a period of time we are going to pay off this debt, and do it as one does with a home mortgage--we are going to 
   pay so much every year for 15 years; not Social Security money, but regular operating money. 
   That Social Security money also needs to be taken out of our grasp, and we are hoping we can do that by having individual accounts where Social Security money belongs to the older person who paid into it, where those dollars, as a way of ensuring there will be benefits, can be invested in equities or bonds and will produce a higher return. It will also belong to the person. If they are unfortunate enough not to live to get all the benefits, it will go into their estate. 
   These are the things we ought to be talking about, not spending $400 billion on new programs, not going through a State of the Union Message in which there is $4 billion a minute proposed. That is, I believe, a reckless budget, and I do not think that budget is going to move in this Congress without a considerable amount of change. 
   There are, hopefully, some things on which we want to agree with the President. He wants to talk about strengthening the military. We ought to do that. We ought to do something to encourage recruiting, to encourage retention, and to provide what is necessary to carry out the missions of the military. We certainly should do that. 
   We want to do some more things for schools based on the idea that it be given to the districts, that they can make the decisions as to how that is done, so we can strengthen education. 
   We ought to be doing something about Medicare prescriptions. We have a program that can be done that keeps it in the private sector generally and allows those who have supplemental programs to continue to have them, perhaps supplement them with a tax reduction but not to do an overall health program, as the President tried before. That is not what we want to do. 
   It is interesting that, of course, we have this great surge of enthusiasm over the idea of spending all the money we possibly can, but we ought to be thinking about taking a minimum amount of money from the taxpayers of this country to run the Government. It has to be paid. Everybody understands that. But when we do have things like surpluses over time--certainly we do not want to be reckless--but to call every tax reduction reckless is distressing. That money belongs to the people who paid into it. 
   If we do not have something to limit these kinds of surpluses, the very thing will happen the President is talking about now, and that is, we will find a way to spend it. What we are looking for is a way to adequately finance the Government, to deal with those things that are high priorities for America, to do something about the national debt, to secure Social Security, and then return this money to where it came from so that it is not here, so it has an opportunity to be in the communities, to be in the towns, to be in the States, and to strengthen this economy. That is what keeps the economy going is people having money to invest and create jobs and these are the directions most important to us. 
   I wanted to let everyone know there are certainly more directions we will take. There are different ideas, all legitimate, as to where we should go. I hope as we proceed, we have an idea of where we want to end up. 
   I was reading ``Alice in Wonderland'' the other night. Remember when Alice fell down and she did not quite know where she was going. She ran into various people. She talked to the rabbit who did not have any ideas, except to promote himself, and the mushroom, who was very unpleasant, and the queen who was going to cut off everybody's head. Finally, she came to a juncture in the road, and there was the Cheshire Cat sitting in a tree. She said: Mr. Cat, what road should I take? 
   He said: Where do you want to go? 
   Alice said: I don't know. 
   The cat said: It doesn't make any difference then, you take whatever road you choose. 
   We need to know where we want to be when we look at this budget, what it has to do with principles of government, the principles of smaller government, the principles of adequate government, and then try to avoid the idea that there are some bucks out there. So let's try to find a way to spend them. 
   I suspect that is what we will hear a great deal about in this session. Unfortunately, I believe we will hear more about issues that can be used politically than we will about trying to solve problems. There are some we have identified and with which we agree. We need to come together and find some solutions to those particular issues. The country will be much better off. 
   I thank the Chair for the time, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, in this coming session--which is going to be relatively short, as it always is on election years, but particularly this year--we have to focus if we intend to accomplish things. I hope we do. As is often the case in election years, there are times when people are more interested in creating the issue than they are in resolving the issue. I think we will see a considerable amount of that, of course, going out towards the Presidential election and trying to find the issues the party will be for--which is all part of the system. But I am hopeful we can concentrate and focus on the issues that we think are most important. 
   We have had some experience, unfortunately in the last several weeks, and certainly even last year, that quite often the minority chose to bring up issues they knew would not be resolved but brought them up continuously to diffuse the issues on which we have been working. In this body, that is easy. One person very readily can hold up things, unless we can get 60 votes to do something different. 
   In any event, I am hopeful that will not be the case. We are going to focus on some things that we have decided upon. This will be more refined as time goes on, but certainly education will be one. The issue of education, of course, is not whether we try to improve it, but how we fund those improvements. I do not believe that we should have one-size-fits-all regulations that come from some bureaucracy in Washington. We should distribute our education funding in a manner that allows the States and local school boards to make those decisions. 
   Certainly the needs in Pinedale, WY, are going to be different than in Philadelphia. That is as it should be. We need to allow for this type of flexibility. 
   Another area that we will be focusing on is health care. We did some work last year on strengthening Medicare, doing something particularly in rural areas so outpatient care can be better financed. We intend to continue to do that, at the same time doing whatever is necessary to ensure Medicare continues to provide the benefits it is designed to provide. 
   Certainly one of the issues that will be difficult and controversial, yet I think most people want to do something about, is providing the opportunity for everyone to have pharmaceuticals available if they cannot afford them; hopefully to protect the programs we have now, to encourage and in fact assist people who now get their own supplementals, but be able to help those people who are not able to do that. 
   Social Security will continue to be an area of great concern. We have made some progress in not spending Social Security money in the operational budget. However, that is not all that is necessary. If the young people who will start making Social Security payments at their first job can expect some benefits 30, 40, 50 years from now, then things will have to be done differently. Obviously, we have alternatives. We can increase taxes--but not many people are for that. Social Security payments are one of the highest taxes  many people pay in the United States. We could reduce benefits--again, there is not much support for that. Or we could, indeed, increase the return on the money that is in a trust. We think that is an excellent idea, to provide individual accounts so at least a portion of the money that is in the fund would belong to you and belong to me. I suspect people over 50 or so would not see any difference, but younger people would have an account that would be theirs and, indeed, could be invested in equities for a much better return. 
   So, along with reducing the debt, those are some of the things, with which we will be involved.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, unfortunately, one of the issues that continues to show up and seems to have nine lives--or more than nine, is the matter of gun control. We have seen it every session a number of times. I am sure we will see it again. I think it is something about which we ought to talk. I believe most people have come to the conclusion that the passage of additional laws is not going to make a great deal of difference in the behavior of criminals. Sadly, law abiding citizens who are exercising their constitutional rights are the ones who will be impacted by additional gun control laws. But it would not affect those who do not intend to abide by the law. Therefore, the idea of additional laws certainly is questionable. 
   In my mind, it is not the direction we ought to take. Fortunately, I think the majority of people in this country also believed the passage of new laws is not the solution. We need to enforce the numerous gun laws that are on the books. 
   Thankfully for our country, the President has not been able to carry out his continuing agenda of wanting more and more gun laws. But, regrettably, he has not been able to make enforcement more effective. More laws are not going to keep those who are willing to break the law from doing things illegally. Stronger enforcement of existing laws is the answer. The administration, however, has not presented such a program. Certainly, we need to move in that direction. 
   When tragedies occur, as they did in Colorado and a number of other places, of course all of us wonder what we can do to ensure that these tragedies do not happen again. The first impulse in a legislative body is to pass more laws. 
   Unfortunately, that is often the most political thing to do. But the fact of the matter is, in almost every instance numerous gun laws were broken when these terrible acts were committed. One might say, what advantage is there in passing more? Indeed, what we ought to be doing is talking about enforcement. 
   As many of you know, the administration has been busy developing new gun control initiatives and additional laws--everything from threatening gun manufacturers with Federal lawsuits to mandatory licensing of new handgun purchases. Currently, there are 26 municipalities that have filed lawsuits against the gun industry, and they are shown on this chart. These lawsuits seek to make gun manufacturers liable for the criminal misuse of firearms. Interestingly enough, three cases have been thrown out by judges in Cincinnati, OH, Bridgeport, CT, and Miami-Dade County, FL. 
   These cases are interesting. For instance these judges noted:  
   ..... the City's complaint is an improper attempt to have this Court substitute its judgment for that of the legislature[.] Only the legislature has the power to engage in the type of regulation.......  
   The city of Cincinnati.  
   The plaintiffs have no statutory of common law basis to recoup their expenditures.......  
   The city of Bridgeport.  
   ..... the Plaintiffs have not directed this Court to any statute or case that would allow a city or county to proceed against a group of manufacturers.......  
   Miami-Dade County, FL. 
   The courts have pointed out municipal lawsuits are not the answer. Interestingly enough, the President has announced the Justice Department will pursue a similar lawsuit against the gun manufacturers on behalf of HUD. Basically, the Federal Government is trying to pressure gun manufacturers into settling their current cases. 
   Once again, the action highlights the President's failure to pass gun control legislation. Instead of bringing forth legislation, he is seeking to go through the judiciary to do what he has been unable to accomplish in Congress. 
   This next graph shows the results of a poll taken recently by CNN and USA Today. It was conducted between December 9 and 12 of last year. Let me read it:  
   As you may know, the U.S. Justice Department is considering filing a lawsuit against the gun manufacture industry seeking to recover the costs associated with gun-related crimes. The companies that manufacture guns in the U.S. have stated the charges have no merit. Which side do you agree with more in this dispute: the Justice Department (or) the gun manufacturers?  
   The result was, those who agreed with the lawsuit by Justice were 28 percent, and those who agreed the lawsuit had little merit were 67 percent. I really believe this poll reflects how American's feel about a government lawsuit against the gun industry. 
   In the President's State of the Union address he spoke about the idea of having individual states regulate the sale of handguns by requiring a photo ID and documentation of the successful completion of a safety course--just to purchase a handgun. This is clearly another attempt by the President to tighten gun laws on law-abiding citizens. Of course, criminals do not register their guns. Enforcement, however, is how we get guns out of the hands of the criminals. Republicans have continued to support law enforcement efforts. 
   Project Exile, for example, which has been put into place around the country, has dropped the murder rate in Richmond, Virginia by 30 percent each year that it has been in place. 
   Unfortunately, President Clinton cannot say the same for his gun control efforts. This is a graph of ATF gun referrals, 
   prosecutions, and convictions in 1992 and 1998. Between 1992 and 1998 ATF referrals for prosecution went down by 5,500 or 44 percent; prosecutions have dropped 40 percent; and, finally, convictions have dropped 31 percent. 
   This graph shows just how tough the administration has been since 1992 regarding the enforcement of existing federal gun laws. 
   Last year, I asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to conduct an audit of the National Instant Check System (NICS). The system was put in place in November 1998 as phase 2 of the Brady Act. I asked the GAO for an audit to see if, indeed, it is operating as Congress intended it to. I am confident when the report is released--and it has not yet been released but will be very soon--we will have results that show the NICS has not been as effective as we hoped it would be. 
   Lastly, since last November, there have been numerous news articles from around the country that highlight the publics disfavor with attempts by the President to add more gun control laws. I want to take a minute to highlight a couple of these. One is titled, it is the ``Wrong Approach,'' by the Cheyenne Tribune Eagle, which suggests:  
   Since the President has been unable to ban individuals from owning guns, Mr. Clinton has decided to do an end run around the Constitution.  
   That is the point of view of that particular paper. 
   Another is titled, ``Gun Deaths, Injuries on Decline.'' This article speaks about a government study which shows that gun deaths have declined since the late 1960's. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print these articles in the RECORD.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I believe all of us want to find a better solution to illegal gun use. We intend to do that. People in my State believe more laws are not the answer, that, indeed, the enforcement of gun laws is the answer. We are pleased to see that the administration has finally added increased funding for the enforcement of existing gun laws--something we have been talking about over the last 7 years. The dollars alone, however, will not do it. There has to be some oversight. We have to make sure there is an effective use of law enforcement.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will take a little time to talk a bit about our agenda and the things I think most of us hope we will accomplish during this coming legislature. 
   There are some who believe we won't accomplish much. It seems to me that is not a good prognosis. The fact is, we should put some priorities on the many issues that are there and, indeed, make a special effort to accomplish a good deal. I think we can. Many of the issues have been talked about a great deal already. We know what the backgrounds are. 
   I think now our commitment is to decide what the priorities are for this country, what the priorities are for this Congress, and to set out to accomplish them. 
   We heard the President last Thursday make a very long speech, including a very long list of ideas and things he is suggesting we consider. I don't believe he is suggesting certainly that they all be done. He knows very well that will not be the case. I think it is up to us, particularly the majority party, to establish an agenda of those things we believe are most important. 
   I read in the paper that some Democrats in the House are saying we aren't going to accomplish anything unless we set the agenda, and we will talk our way through that. I am very disappointed in that kind of an idea. Of course, it is possible to continue to raise all these issues that one knows are not going anywhere. I suspect that is not a new idea even in this body. But we need to have a set of priorities. 
   The President had 100-plus ideas that, I suppose, were set forth to lay out a political agenda, maybe largely for this election. That is fine. It is not a brand new idea. I am surprised the agenda pointed in a different direction than that with which the President has sought to characterize himself over the last several years. He talked about the leadership council and starting towards the center, saying, I think some time ago, that the era of big government is over. One would not have suspected that, as they listened last Thursday night to his view, that the era of big government is over. 
   It was a very liberal agenda laid out, I am sure, for conduct of this session of Congress. I suggest that is not the direction we ought to take. Expenditures of some $400 billion in additional programs, $400 billion in spending, some $4 billion a minute during that process, with very little detail, of course, as to how it is done but, rather, here are the things we ought to do, sort of in a broad sense. 
   We need to ensure that the description of what we are going to do does not interfere with us doing something. We have an agenda. Much of it I am  hopeful the President will agree with and the Members on the other side of the aisle will agree with. Certainly I am not excited about the idea the minority party will set the agenda, just simply by the discussions that go on endlessly. When it comes to spending, of course, there are many of us in this body who were sent here by our constituents to see if we can't limit the growth of Government, and we have succeeded some in the last couple years. Even though it was a large one, the growth in last year's budget was something around 3 percent, which was about the inflation rate, which is considerably less than it has been over the last 10 years, where the rate has gone up much higher than that. 
   Did we hold down spending enough? No, I don't believe so. To do that, we have to have a little different system this year. 
   Hopefully, we will do that. I think we are already beginning to deal with the budget, with the appropriations, so that we don't end up at the end of the session with a huge bill that many people are not even familiar with all the content. So we need to do that. 
   I am one who believes we ought to be setting about to hold down the size of the Federal Government rather than to expand it. I am one who believes there is a limit to the kinds of things the Federal Government is designed to do. I think that is very clear in the Constitution. We have exceeded that in many ways, but it is not too late to take a look at what we are doing and say, is that the appropriate thing for the Federal Government to do? Are these the things the Federal Government can do better than any other government? I don't think so. When we talk about States and the differences we have among States, certainly, I come from a State that is the eighth largest State in the Union, one of the smallest in population. Our needs and methods of delivery of health care, the management of public lands, all those things are quite different in Wyoming than they are in Rhode Island or Pennsylvania, and properly so, which seems to me to be a good indication that we should not be continuing to have the one-size-fits-all kind of Federal pronouncements from the Congress and from the bureaucracy in Washington. 
   One of the things I hope we do over time is change our system to biennial budgeting, where we have a budget that lasts for 2 years. It seems to me it is very appropriate to do that. Most States do it that way. For one thing, the agencies then have a longer time to know what their spending restrictions are for a period of 2 years. Maybe more importantly, however, we have an opportunity to exercise the oversight which is the responsibility of Congress, which we don't do very well. Unfortunately, we spend so much of our time on appropriations and other things that the idea of ensuring that the laws which are passed are carried out consistent with the intent of the law is something we don't spend enough time doing. 
   I want to come back to the floor next week and talk a little bit about that provision in, I think, a 1996 law which provides that regulations that are put together by the bureaucracies must come to the House and the Senate to be reviewed. Seldom does that ever happen. I think only one or two times has there been some kind of a motion to change those, and none have succeeded because the system is not workable. A great idea, and we have that in most legislatures where there is oversight of the legislature by the regulations that come out to augment the laws that have been passed. We don't do that here. 
   So we ought to hold down spending. We ought to have smaller Government. We ought to seek to review the kinds of things the Federal Government has involved itself in and ensure that there are reasonable things that are best done here. That doesn't mean there isn't a role for government. Of course there is. But often that role can be best implemented at the State and local level. 
   We need to talk about reducing the Federal debt in a real way. We have been doing some work on that for the first time in 40 years, I think. We have not spent Social Security. We balanced the budget for the first time in 25 years. We are using Social Security money to pay down the publicly held debt, which is a good idea. It reduces the cost of that debt. It takes the Social Security money out of the opportunity to be spent. That is good. Nevertheless, the key there is that it is reducing publicly held debt. We are replacing one debt with another kind of debt. When these young people are eligible for benefits from Social Security, those dollars that have been put into a trust fund to replace debt will have to be recovered from the taxpayers at that time. So we need to do something more than that. 
   In my opinion, we ought to set about to figure out some kind of a process over a period of time that we commit ourselves to a payment each year to pay off the debt out of operating funds, that we do it much like a mortgage on your home. We can decide that we will pay off $15 billion, or whatever it is, each year, and do that over a period of time. That would be real debt reduction. That would be reduction that would help to keep the so-called surplus from being spent to increase the size of Government. So we can do that and reduce our debt in a real way. 
   We also, hopefully, will pursue--when we have a surplus--what are considered to be the real needs of the Federal Government, and after we secure Social Security and pay down some of the debt, that money will then be returned to the taxpayers so it can be used to buoy the economy. Otherwise, frankly, the money left floating around is going to be spent. If you don't like the concept of increasingly large Government, when there is money beyond what there is a target for, then it ought to be sent back to the people who paid it in in the beginning. 
   What are the priorities? They are pretty clear. They have been the same for several years and will continue to be. I think that is where we ought to focus. Certainly, most people would consider education to be the issue we are most concerned with--having an opportunity for all young people to have an education. Obviously, money is not the total answer. There has to be accountability, training, and there have to be things that happen within the school system in addition to money. You can't do it without money, however; it is essential. 
   Health care is one issue, obviously, about which everybody is concerned. We are trying to do some things about that. We need to continue to do that. I am proud of the health care system we have in this country, certainly in terms of quality. On the other hand, we have to start to be a little careful about what that quality costs--affordability. But we can do some things about the health care. 
   Social Security. There is no question but that we have to change Social Security if we are to have it for these young people who start to pay in the very moment they get a job, and 
   most of whom now don't expect to have benefits in 30, 40, 50 years. We need to change it so that the benefits will be there. There are several alternatives that can be used to change that. Certainly there needs to be a continued reduction in taxes. 
   In education, I am proud of what we have done so far. This GOP Congress provided more funding in the last year than the President requested. We did get into a hassle, of course, about how the money is spent. You may recall the President insisted it be spent on 100,000 teachers. I can tell you, there are schools where I live where additional teachers are not the issue; there are other things that need to be done. So we need to give the flexibility to the State and local school boards as to how they spend the money to strengthen education. We will insist on that being part of the system we produce this year. The elementary and secondary education bill this year, I hope, will be passed for safe schools and keeping the parents involved, and particularly making sure that all children have a chance for quality education. 
   I am interested, of course, in access to education in rural communities. I am also particularly, for a number of reasons, and personally interested in special education for special kids. My wife has been a special education teacher for 25 years, and I am very proud of that. Education will be one issue we will continue to press on. 
   Health care, of course, we will continue to have on our agenda, and it will be one of the most important things we pass. We passed a number of things last year. In my State, for example, in small towns, we have hospitals that won't be able to have a full series of services and up until now could not be certified and did not receive dollars  from HCFA. We changed that so they can be something much like a clinic and have emergency care, so patients can be transferred on--sort of a wheel-and-hub concept. We did that last year. 
   Certainly, we need to increase the funding for Medicare and hospitals and all kinds of service providers.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Idaho. Certainly, we share all those thoughts and ideas. I want to expand in the few minutes we have remaining in our allotment of time the public land issue the Senator mentioned. 
   Public lands, of course, are very important to those of us in the West. As was pointed out, 1 out of every 4 acres in this country is owned by the public. My State of Wyoming is 50-percent owned by the Federal Government. Idaho is some 63-percent owned by the Federal Government. Nevada is 83-percent owned by the Federal Government. The management of these lands then, rightfully, is a public issue and one with which all of us need to be concerned. 
   It would not be a surprise to know that some of the issues with regard to the management of those lands are seen differently by the people who live there and who have access to the lands as opposed to those who equally own them and live many miles away. The fact is it is a public issue and it deserves public input. 
   There is a system that has been set up by the Congress and happens to be followed by everyone, except the administration, which allows for public input. It requires that all ideas be set forth so that they can be considered and there can be statements made on all these issues. Sometimes it takes an excruciatingly long time to do it, but nevertheless it is a vital concept. 
   Now, of course, we have a different thing going on in the administration. They call it a land legacy, an effort by the President in these remaining months to leave a Teddy Roosevelt land legacy for himself and his administration. 
   In so doing, he has done a number of things quite different from what we have seen done before and, quite frankly, has created a good deal of controversy, particularly in the West. 
   There are different kinds of lands, of course, set out for different purposes. I happen to be chairman of the Parks Subcommittee, so I am very interested in that. I grew up right outside of Yellowstone National Park. As you know, Wyoming has several famous national parks. We are very proud of them. Those lands were set aside for a particular purpose. They were set aside because they were unique and they were different. They are used for a limited number of purposes. 
   We have the forest reserve which, by its nature, was set aside, was reserved for special uses. Although there are many, part of them are wilderness areas set aside by the Congress in specific acts that limit the use, and properly so, in my view. 
   Then there is the Bureau of Land Management, which has a very large section of lands. Those lands, rather than having been set aside for some particular purpose, were generally what was left after the Homestead Act was completed. They were sort of residual lands that were managed, first of all, by a different agency but now by the Bureau of Land Management--clearly multiple use lands. They are used for many things. 
   These are the kinds of things we have. We have seen suddenly a rush for doing something in public lands. The system being used now by the administration completely ignores the Congress, which should have a say in these kinds of things, and as a matter of fact generally ignores people. One of them is the 40 million acres of roadless areas nationwide that were declared by the Forest Service. 
   Frankly, I have no particular quarrel with the idea of taking a look at roadless areas in the forests, but each forest has a very extensive, very expensive, very important forest plan, a process that has been gone through that requires studies, that requires proposed regulation, that requires statements, that requires hearings. That is where those things ought to be done rather than having one EIS over the whole Nation, not for the Secretary of Agriculture to just come out and declare that there are going to be 40 million acres, and not even knowing exactly where they are. 
   As a matter of fact, we had a hearing with the Secretary and with the Chief of the Forest Service in which they could tell us very little about it. 
   Another is the $1 billion from offshore oil royalties that the administration has asked to be given to it to spend, without the approval of Congress, to acquire additional lands. 
   As the Senator from Idaho said, in the Western States the acquisition of new lands is not the issue. The care of those lands, the investment in parks, the investment in forests is where we ought to be, in my view. 
   The Antiquities Act, which is a legitimate act, has been on the books since 1905. Teddy Roosevelt put it there. As a matter of fact, Devils Tower, in my State, was put in by the Antiquities Act and was part of Teton National Park. But times have changed, and we understand now the President is going to have 18 different land areas changed in their designation without, really, any hearings--we had one last year in Utah that the Governor and the congressional delegation did not even know about until it was done. That is not the way to do these 
   kinds of things. 
   They have a proposal to change the way the Land and Water Conservation Fund is allocated. It was set up by Congress to go half and half--State and national. Now the administration wants to spend all that money for land acquisition. 
   BLM now has a nationwide roadless plan in which there is very little, if any, input. They have the Clean Water Action Plan, which is something done by EPA, which has to do with the control of water, which is really a way of controlling land. 
   Each of these things probably has some merit, but they ought to be examined. They ought to go through the system. They ought to be talked about. They ought to be agreed to, rather than imposed unilaterally by an administration. 
   We can preserve public lands, and, indeed, we should: they are a legacy for us. We can have multiple use on those lands. We need them for the communities. We can have public involvement. That is the way it ought to be. We can have cooperating agency agreements in which the State and the local communities ought to have a real voice in doing this. 
   I hope we do not politicize public lands simply because it is an election year, to the distraction of public use, to the distraction of the economies that surround them. The purpose of public lands is to preserve the resources and give a chance for the owners to enjoy it. The owners, of course, are the taxpayers. 
   It is an issue on which I think we will have more and more input throughout the year. I hope we do. 
   Mr. President, our time is nearly expired. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to take some time, since we have a little on our hands this morning, to talk about an issue that continues to be very important for our part of the country, the West. The Presiding Officer comes from a State that is similar to Wyoming. The ownership of land by the Federal Government continues to be an issue, and I think it is more of an issue now than it has been in the past, largely because of some of the actions in recent times by the administration of not only obtaining more land for the Federal Government but also changing some of the management techniques. 
   This issue, of course, has been one of controversy for a long time within the West. The West has large amounts of land that belongs to the Federal Government. So when you develop the economy of your State, management of the lands has a great deal to do with it. In Wyoming, for example, the three leading economic activities are agriculture, minerals, and tourism, all of which have a great deal to do with public resources, with lands. So it is one of the most important issues with which we deal. 
   It is interesting to see the percentages of Federal land holdings by State. As shown on this chart, you can see that here in the East generally 1 to 5 percent of the lands are federally owned. When you get to the West, it becomes 35 to 65 percent and as high as 87 percent in some States. So when you talk about how you operate an economy in New Jersey or in North Carolina, it is quite different. When you talk about public lands, it is seen quite differently. The impact in States such as that is relatively minor, where the impact in the West is much greater. Look at Alaska, for example. It makes a great deal of difference. 
   There are several kinds of lands, of course, and nobody argues with the idea that the purpose of dealing with these public lands is to preserve the resources. All of us want to do that. The second purpose, however, is to allow for its owners, the American people, who use them, to have access to these lands for hunting, fishing, grazing, timber--all of the things that go with multiple use and healthy public lands. Really, that is where we are. No one argues about the concept of these resources, but there is great argument about the details of how you do it. 
   One of the things that is happening now--and part of it is in the appropriations bills that will be before us tomorrow--relates to the purchase of lands and changing some of the management techniques so the lands become less accessible to the people who live there, less a part of the society of these States. 
   It is difficult to see on this chart, but 
   this is Wyoming, where over 50 percent of the land belongs to the Federal Government. The green colors are Forest Service lands which were set aside by action of the Congress, action of the  Federal Government, for specific purposes, and we still fulfill those purposes. 
   Some of the lands were set aside as wilderness. When the wilderness was set aside, others were proclaimed to be for multiple use. Before that changed from multiple use to wilderness, it said specifically in the Wyoming wilderness bill that Congress had to act on it. The red area is Federal lands, Indian reservations. Yellow is the BLM lands. The light green in the corners is national parks which were set aside for a very specific purpose. That purpose continues to be one that is very close to the hearts of the American People. I happen to be chairman of the parks subcommittee and work on those very much. The yellow--the majority of the public lands in our State, as is the case with most other Western States--is Bureau of Land Management lands. Interestingly enough, when the Homestead Act was in place and people were taking homesteads in the West, BLM lands were basically residual lands, not set aside for any particular purpose. They were simply there when the homestead expired, and they are there now to be managed for multiple use. 
   Let me go back to the notion that this is what has created some of the current controversy--the fact that these lands change when they are used differently. Congress should have a role in this. This is not a monarchy, a government where the President can decide suddenly he is going to acquire more lands without the authority of the Congress. That is kind of where we are now. There are several of these programs that are threatening to the West, including the concept of the Federal Government's intrusion into the whole of society in States in the West. 
   A number of things are happening. One is the so-called ``land legacy'' that the administration is pushing. It is an idea presented by the President--I think largely by Vice President GORE--that the Federal Government somehow should own a great deal more land than it owns now. Indeed, they have asked for a set-aside from the offshore royalties of a billion dollars a year to acquire more lands. In many cases, their idea is not to have any involvement of the Congress at all but simply to allow them to have this money set aside, without the appropriations process, so that they can purchase additional lands each year. A portion of that is in this year's Interior program, but the big one, of course, is still controversial in the Congress, and it was being dealt with in the House last week or the week before. 
   So the question is, if there is to be more Federal land, where should it be? The other is, if there is to be more, what is the role of Congress to authorize it and appropriate funds for that as opposed to having a sort of monarchy set-aside to do that. 
   The other, of course, in my view, has to do with the use of these dollars. We talked about the parks. That is one of the things. We have 378 parks, or units, managed by the Park Service in this country; they are very important to Americans. The infrastructure in many of them needs to be repaired and updated. I argue this money that might be available from these kinds of sources ought to be used for the infrastructure of these parks so that we can continue to support 
   the maintenance and availability of enjoyable visits for the American people. I believe we need to do that. 
   Another that has come along more recently is a pronouncement by the Forest Service that they would like to set aside 40 million acres in the forest as ``roadless.'' Nobody knows what ``roadless'' means. Is that a synonym for wilderness? We don't know. We had a hearing to try to get that answered by the Secretary of Agriculture and by the Chief of the Forest Service. We were unable to do so. Many people I know believe that would limit the access and would not allow people to hunt, for example, in places where they aren't able to walk because they are elderly, or whatever the reason, and that it will be most difficult to have a healthy forest, where you cannot remove some of the trees that are matured and, rather, let them die or let insects infect them. These are the kinds of things that are of great concern. 
   There is also what is called an action plan, the conservation of water action plan, which seems to be put forth by EPA and other agencies more to control management of the land than clean water. The clean water action plan says you can do certain things and you cannot do certain things. The key is there needs to be participation by people who live there. There needs to be some participation in cooperating agencies, participation with the State, participation with the agencies there, so we can work together to preserve the resource but also preserve access to those resources and continue to allow them to be part of the recreational economy in our States. 
   There are other programs that also put at risk the opportunity to use these lands, such as endangered species, about which there is a great controversy in terms of whether there is a scientific basis for the listing of endangered species, whether there are, in fact, ways to delist endangered species when it is proven there has been a recovery in terms of numbers. You can argue forever about that. These all go together to make public lands increasingly more difficult for owner utilization. 
   I guess one of the reasons that is difficult--and people who work with these problems are basically in the minority--is that the Western States are the ones that have almost all Federal ownership. 
   With respect to some of the things we might do with regard to the land legacy and the idea of putting money aside for public land purchase, we are prepared to try to put in this bill some sort of protection and say we ought not, in States that have more than 25 percent of their surface owned by the Federal Government, to have any net gain--that there may be things the Federal Government ought to acquire because they have a unique aspect to them, but they can also dispose of some so that there is no net increase. I think that is a reasonable thing to do and one we ought to pursue. 
   In terms of endangered species, it is very difficult to do anything with a law that has been in place for 20 years. We have 20 years of experience as to how to better manage it. Everyone wants to preserve these species. But they shouldn't have to set aside private and public lands to do that. We believe if we would require more science in terms of nomination and listing--and indeed, when a species is listed, to have a recovery plan at the same time--that would be very important. 
   One of the other activities is the Natural Environmental Protection Act, NEPA, a program in which there are studies designed to allow people to participate in decisions. Is that a good idea? Studies could absolutely go on forever. 
   We are faced currently, for example, with the problem in grazing. Obviously, you have a renewable resource, grass. It is reasonable to have grazing. You have that on BLM forest lands. Now we find in this case that, under BLM, you can get through the NEPA process to renew a contract, and they say: Too bad; your contract is dead, unless we can get to it, and we can't. 
   We are trying to change that. It is an unreasonable thing to do. If there is all of this difficulty with the agency, we ought to change that. Indeed, there is language in this year's appropriations bill to do something about it. 
   I think we are faced with trying to find the best way to deal in the future with public lands. In States where there is 50 percent or more of land in Federal ownership, there is no reason we can't continue to protect those resources; that we can't continue to utilize those lands in a reasonable way; that we can't involve people locally in the States in making these decisions and making shared judgments. We can do that. 
   Unfortunately, we find this administration moving in the other direction--moving further way from working with NEPA. We hear about all of these kinds of partnerships. A partnership means there is some equality in working together. That is not the kind of partnership we hear a lot about from the Federal agency. I am hopeful that there can be. 
   We are very proud of these resources: Yellowstone Park, Devil's Tower--all kinds of great resources in Wyoming. Here is where I grew up, near the Shoshone Forest. I am delighted there is a forest there. It should be, and it should continue to be there. But we need to have a cooperative management process to do that. I am committed. I am  also committed to working toward that in the coming session. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. THOMAS. 
   Mr. President, today I join Senator ENZI in introducing legislation that will give small businesses more flexibility in how they choose to operate. 
   One of the most important decisions for the founder of a business is ``choice of entity,'' whether to operate the business through a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other form of business. This choice is plainly important for reaching business goals, and may be critical to the survival of the business. For the family business, the choice also is inseparable from the owner's preferences as to how the owner wants to relate to family co-owners. Choice of entity is therefore potentially one of the most important decisions for an owner. 
   The law concerning choice of entity has changed enormously in the last decade, particularly with the widespread adoption of laws authorizing the limited liability company (LLC). As a result, business owners have more flexibility in this area than ever before. Even so, older family businesses operated as S corporations may be ``locked'' into the corporate form, simply because of the tax cost of changing to another form. These businesses are thus unable to take advantages of the recent advancements in choice of entity. 
   In order to help these older businesses remain competitive with their younger rivals, the bill Senator ENZI and I introduce today will allow a one-time election for an S corporation to change to another form of business without incurring the normal tax cost of doing so. 
   Thousands of corporations have elected subchapter S status since President Eisenhower signed into law the Technical Amendments Act of 1958, which added subchapter S to the code. The legislative history makes clear that the purpose of subchapter S was to offer simplified tax rules for the small and family-owned business operating in the corporate form. 
   Until the rise of the LLC in the mid 1990's, the S corporation remained, for all practical purposes, the sole means for a small or family business to obtain the benefits of limited liability without the complex corporate tax. For many years, a change to another form of business was relatively easy. But by the time an alternative to the S corporation became widely available, this avenue had been foreclosed by changes to the tax code. Thus thousands of S corporations are saddled with the cumbersome and inflexible rules of the corporate form. 
   The Internal Revenue Code itself reflects a policy of respecting economic reality over form in the conduct of a trade or business. For example, Section 1031, which existed even in 1939, allows nonrecognition of gain or loss in the exchange of property used in a trade or business, or for investment, on the theory that the taxpayer has not cashed out his investment. Code Sections 351 and 721 allow nonrecognition on the contribution of property to a corporation or a partnership, on the rationale that the taxpayer is only changing the form of his investment. 
   The S election itself was a giant stride in removing tax considerations in choice of entity. More recently, the Internal Revenue Service has done much to remove tax considerations from the choice of business form through the check the box regulations.  The Service should be commended for taking this step. 
   The next step in the process is allowing those S corporations that can more efficiently function as an LLC the one-time chance to make the conversion, without tax cost being the controlling factor. Until these conversions can be accomplished, the task of reducing the role of taxes in choosing a business form will remain unfinished. 
   I look forward to working with Senator ROTH and the other members of the Senate Finance Committee so we may take action on this measure as soon as possible.

   Mr. THOMAS. That is correct. I was one of 23 signatories of a letter dated April 16, 1999, that provides several reasons why unilateral tariff reductions should be avoided. First, wool fabric similar to the foreign imported product, subject to tariffs, is already available from domestic producers. Second, this is not the appropriate time to address accelerated tariff reductions as wool fabric tariffs are currently being reduced at the multilateral level. U.S. producers and textile companies have made investments and based business decisions on trade negotiations that were reached under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and 
   the World Trade Organization (WTO). If we are to consider additional tariff reductions, those discussions should occur during trade negotiations, instead of being legislated on the floor of the U.S. Senate. U.S. manufacturers are the only customers domestic wool growers have; virtually no wool is exported. Wyoming is the second largest wool producing state and because of already depressed wool prices, our growers can not break even, let alone turn a profit. Accelerating wool fabric tariff cuts, at this time, will only further decrease fiber prices and sales, consequently putting U.S. wool growers and textile workers at risk. I thank my colleague, Senator LIEBERMAN, for his work on this crucial issue.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today to provide for the conveyance of economic development land for Park County, WY. 
   The management of our public lands and natural resources is often complicated and requires the coordination of many individuals to accomplish desired objectives. When western folks  discuss Federal land issues, we do not often have an opportunity to identify proposals that capture and enjoy the support from a wide array of interests; however, the bill Senator ENZI and I are introducing today offers just such a unique prospect. Project coordinators and involved parties have spent a great deal of time incorporating the concerns of various individuals by presenting their plans to agency and congressional representatives. 
   This parcel of land was identified by the Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Reclamation as an unsuitable area for public domain and the agencies have recommended that it be disposed of by the Federal Government. The Park County Commissioners subsequently approached the Wyoming Congressional Delegation about allowing the county to pursue economic development efforts that would be beneficial to the local town and surrounding communities. Specifically, this legislation is needed to allow the Federal Government to sell approximately 190 acres of land to Park County, WY for the appraised value of $240,000. The county commissioners intend to work with an economic development group to attract new businesses to the area and allow other companies to expand at an industrial park adjacent to the conveyance land. 
   Mr. President, this bill enjoys the support of many different groups including county government officials as well as the local community. This proposal will provide for the creation of a number of private sector jobs in a county that has 82 percent Federal land ownership. It is my hope that the Senate will seize this opportunity to allow a local community to improve their livelihoods and economic prospects.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, let me first thank my friend from New Hampshire for coming down. We have morning business now for 2 hours, and we intend to talk about some of the issues before us during this first hour. I am going to at some point--and I hope the Senator will also--talk a little bit about some of the things we have accomplished this year. I understand the media is always interested in the conflicts and where we have controversy. And that is fine. But they do not always talk about the things we have accomplished, the things we have done with the budget, the fact we have spent less in growth this year than we have for a number of years, the fact that we are setting aside Social Security and have proposals out there to strengthen Social Security. We have done a lot for education; indeed, authorized more money to be spent than the administration asked for and allowed for it to be spent on the local level. These are things that are terribly important. 
   Defense is probably the singular most important thing the Federal Government has to assume. The expenditures of defense have gone down ever since the gulf war. This year we have raised them because in order to fill out the mission the military has, there must be more resources to be able to encourage people to come into the military and to stay there. 
   We have talked about tax relief, and, indeed, sent to the President a bill which would have given tax relief to all citizens of this country in various ways rather than spending it. Unfortunately, it was vetoed. We will be back with tax relief. When we have an excess amount of money, that is where it ought to go, back to the people who have paid it. 
   In health care, we have done some things and intend to do more before the week is over; and bankruptcy. 
   I wish to say I hope before we finish we can put some emphasis on the positive things that we have done for the good of this country. 
   I yield to my good friend from New Hampshire, who has done a superb job on the appropriations bills, and continues to do so, whatever time he may consume.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, one of the bills currently being considered, and is very important to the West particularly, is the Interior funding bill, the bill that funds the Interior Department, national parks, the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and others. It is relatively small compared to others. It is around $13 billion, $14 billion. I never thought I would suggest that is small, but compared to $360 billion it is relatively small. 
   It has been tied up for a number of reasons. It has to do with the so-called land legacy the administration has been pushing recently, the idea of purchasing a great amount of land that has something to do with S. 25 that will bring in dollars from the Outer Continental Shelf royalties to be used in this area. 
   The controversy is over the purchase of additional lands. There are some good things about S. 25--taking some more money from oil royalties and using them for parks. I am chairman of the Parks Subcommittee, and I met this morning with the new advisory committee that will be focusing on concessions. The parks are more and more in demand, more and more people are coming to them, and more and more people are taking advantage of the parks, one of the legacies of this country. We are having problems with the upkeep of the infrastructure that must be done to preserve historic and natural values. I support that. 
   The park system, of course, has to be part of another section of parks, and that is local and State parks. National parks are not designed to provide all the services that people need. In communities, these are local responsibilities. Ball parks, for example, are put in by State and local parks. So they, too, need additional funding. 
   One of the interesting areas, particularly those in the West where they do a great deal of wild game hunting, is a thing called teaming for wildlife. In our State, for example, the funds that go to the game and fish department come from the purchase of licenses for game animals. They spend a great deal of their time dealing with animals that are not game animals that are threatened, endangered. 
   The problem, however, is the administration insists on having $1 billion a year to spend as they choose to buy land. This week, we had a hearing on the Forest Service setting aside 40 million acres by fiat, by administrative decree, to be used for de facto wilderness, if they choose, when under the law clearly to set aside land of that kind is the responsibility of the Congress. 
   We are having increasing difficulty with that. I do not know whether it is driven by the President's desire to have a legacy, to be a latter century Theodore Roosevelt, or whether it is the environmental aspect of the Gore campaign. The fact is, the White House is not a monarchy; it does not decide to do these things individually. There has to be a cooperative arrangement with the Congress, whether it is purchasing or whether it is assigning different designations to land. That is the way it is, and it needs to be preserved in that fashion, in my judgment. 
   We need to move forward with the Interior bill. It is one of about three bills that remains out of the 13, which is kind of surprising because it is one upon which most people here agree. There are a couple of things in it that are being used which I think are not realistic. One has to do with permits for 
   grazing on Forest Service lands. Ranchers in the West--they have their base lands, of course--use grazing so we can have multiple use of public lands and forests, have grazing leases. In order to renew those leases, there needs to be a study. No one argues with the idea there needs to be a study. Unfortunately, they have not been able to keep up with the number of studies that need to be made, and so the study is not made before the permit expires and the Federal Government says: That's too bad, you're out of luck; take your cows and go home--when it has nothing to do with the permittee having not gotten the job done. 
   What this amendment to the Interior bill says is the permit will be renewed for a period of time until this study can be made. If the study is made and there have to be changes, then there can be changes. That is held up somehow by the White House, and they are making a big thing and separating that out. 
   The other is on oil royalties. We worked a long time trying to get fairness in oil royalties, taking out some of the charges and costs before the Government takes over, and percentage of royalties. We have not come to an agreement. This simply says, let's set it aside until the Congress and the executive department can come together. Again, not a willingness to work in a team fashion. 
   I am hopeful we can get by those kinds of things this week. We are aiming to get out of here in 3 days, in fact. The fact is, it is possible. 
   There are really only about three bills that need to be determined. Everyone knows what changes need to be  focused on, what kind of concessions need to be made on both sides to make this happen. Usually, as we come down to the end, it is amazing how quickly some things can be done as opposed to when they just stretch out in the future. 
   So our goals are to have no Government shutdown--certainly that is the Republican position for the rest of this year--we are settled on not having any new taxes to finance this year's new programs--we certainly have an adequate amount of money--and we are committed to paying down the publicly held debt and to protecting the Social Security surplus. These are the kinds of things I think everyone can agree upon if we can get to it this time. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. 
   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes and talk about some of the things we are doing. Obviously, we are heading toward the end of this session. There is speculation as to when we will conclude our work. Of course, before that is done, clearly the most important thing before us is the appropriations process, funding the Government, and we will do that. 
   I had the opportunity this weekend to spend some time in my home State. I can always pick up things about which people feel strongly. They want to see the budget signed. There are differences of view as to what that budget should contain--legitimately, of course. 
   Most of the people in my State--and I certainly believe they are well informed because I agree with them--think we ought to hold down the size of the budget because that is how we really put some limits on Government. That does not mean we do not fund the things that are essential. Certainly we will not always have unanimity on what people perceive as being essential, and that is what it is all about. 
   People do want the budget signed. They do not want the Government to shut down, nor does anyone here, and I hope not the President. He has indicated he does not. We have about five bills to complete and get signed. I am optimistic about it. We will conclude our work without a shutdown. We will conclude our work without spending Social Security dollars, which was the commitment we made. 
   Out of the surplus this year--a surplus, frankly, for the second time in 25 years--we will only spend that money when it comes in the operational budget and not the budget of Social 
   Security. More important, not only will we not spend Social Security money, but we also have a plan to strengthen Social Security for the future. To save Social Security is not enough. We must do that, of course. 
   The other thing I have heard--and I already mentioned it--is hold down the size of Government; we do not want the Federal Government to continue to grow and to be the dominating factor in people's lives. Indeed, there are essential elements of the Federal Government, but the strength lies in the communities, States, and counties of this country. The more decisionmaking that takes place there, it seems to me the stronger we will be and the closer we will be to the governed making the decisions, and the better off we will be. 
   We will do well. We will have to make some adjustments. One of them may well be an across-the-board cut of 1 percent. I happen to favor that idea. We are talking about a discretionary budget of about $595 billion. That is out of a total of about $1.7 trillion, the rest being mandatory. We are talking about actually below 1 percent, a .97-percent across-the-board cut, which is about $3.5 billion. That will bring us down to $592 billion. I cannot imagine that agencies with a budget of $15 billion or $260 billion are unable to find 1 percent that can be reduced. Generally, through things that are not terribly  important or some even considered to be wasteful spending, they can find 1 percent. In any event, I am very confident that can be done. 
   Some say it will require the military to lay off. The fact is, after 1 percent, it would still be a substantial increase over last year and over the President's request for the military budget. We are closing in on getting that job done. Certainly it is the compelling task before us. 
   It reminds me of one of the things I believe we ought to consider, and that is a biennial budget, so we can do this business of budgeting and allocating resources every other year, which has the advantage of giving agencies and the Federal Government a better opportunity of knowing what they will be doing for a longer period of time. But more important, it provides an opportunity for 1 year to do budgeting and appropriations and 1 year for oversight which, in my view, is equally important. It is important for the Congress to have oversight of the expenditures and to ensure these expenditures are implementing policies that have been passed by the Congress. 
   Most States do biennial budgeting and find it very useful, very satisfactory, and successful. I suspect there will be resistance, of course, from those involved in the appropriations process because it will eliminate 1 year in which they have perhaps extraordinary authority in the direction we will take. Nevertheless, I hope this idea is favored by the chairman of the Budget Committee and by the leader of the Senate majority. That is something we ought to consider. 
   As we talk to people at home, we ought to talk a little bit about the accomplishments of this Congress. I believe it has been extraordinary. It is a little difficult to keep up with it through the media's description of what we do; they don't like to talk about anything unless it is sensational; and also opportunities to communicate are very difficult. One of them is the budget. 
   We have a surplus--the first time in 42 years. Two years in a row, we have had a surplus. Part of that, obviously, is we have more revenue coming in and a strong economy. But equally 
   as important--perhaps more important--is the balanced budget amendments that were passed 3 years ago that have kept down spending. At the end of the seventies and through the eighties, into the nineties, growth each year was in the neighborhood of 10 to 12 percent. In this year, it is just over 2 percent. Is it where we want to be? No. For many of us, it is not. Nevertheless, it is progress. We even have had, of course, a non-Social Security surplus. 
   Instead of spending at 10 percent, which we did in the early eighties, we are spending at 2.8-percent growth. That is pretty good. 
   Spending as a percent of gross national product has fallen during the nineties. Unfortunately, largely because of the President's tax bill in 1995, the percentage of taxes with respect to the gross national product has increased, the highest since World War II. Of course, we tried to do something about that. We passed a bill that would have been a reduction in taxes, but, unfortunately, the President vetoed it. 
   I mentioned Social Security and that we have to do more than simply talk about it. We can do that. Two years ago, President Clinton urged us to save Social Security first. Unfortunately, he has done very little since then, but there have been a number of things done here. Republicans have worked hard in seeking passage of a Social Security lockbox. Unfortunately, it has been filibustered on the other side of the aisle. 
   One of the most fundamental changes I hope will be considered next year and passed is the notion of having private accounts where people who are closer to the retirement benefit age will continue as they are. But people 25, 35, and 40 years old will have the opportunity to take the dollars they have contributed to Social Security and put them in a personal account, directly invested in equities, directed by the owner through an investment program, that will have several benefits. 
   One, it would belong to the taxpayer. If, unfortunately, you were not able to utilize it before you passed away, it would be part of your estate. The second is, the return on the investment would be more substantially invested in equities than it would be invested as it is now in Government securities. That is the real direction we need to take. 
   Tax relief, of course, will be back again. It continues to be an issue. When you have taxpayers who are paying more into the Federal Government than is necessary to sustain the essential elements of the Government, then the money ought to be returned. It has been said--and it is probably true--that if dollars remain in Washington, they have a way of getting spent. So we ought to give some relief to taxpayers. 
   I was out last summer, in August, talking about the tax relief bill, and people sort of rolled their eyes about it because they had heard that before. But when you talked about the elements of it, they became very interested and supportive of it. 
   Estate taxes: For example, we have a lot of agriculture in Wyoming. Many agriculturists have almost all of their life's earnings in property, not in yearly income but in the estate they build up in that farm or ranch. Currently, they could lose nearly half of that through estate taxes. We would like to do away with those over a period of time. 
   Capital gains: More and more people are investing money in the market and seeking to take care of themselves for their old age security or to supplement their Social Security. We need to encourage that. One way to do that is to reduce the tax on capital gains. 
   The marriage penalty: Almost everyone would agree to the fact that a marriage penalty is very unfair, where two young people who are single at a certain wage level pay a certain amount of tax, but if they get married, they pay a higher amount of tax. That is not fair. We sought to change that. Unfortunately, as I said, that was vetoed. Nevertheless, I consider it to be an accomplishment for the Republican Senate because it sets the groundwork to move forward in another year. 
   Education: This budget we are talking about contains more for education than the President requested. He is arguing about that. The big argument is not the amount of money. The argument is because the President wants to dictate, to stipulate where the money goes--in this case for 100,000 teachers. We think it makes much more sense to be more flexible. If you have the money, send it to the States, send it to the school districts, and let those folks decide where it is most efficient to invest the money. 
   I have a strong belief that the needs in Greybull, WY, are quite different than they are in Pittsburgh. We ought to be able to adjust for that. I believe what we have done, in the case of education with Ed-Flex, is given local people more flexibility. So there is additional money in this budget for education. We had money in our tax bill to encourage education, as well. I am pretty pleased about that. 
   National security: We have added $17 billion for the defense of this country. Probably, if you had to select the item and the issue that the National Government is most responsible for--the Federal Government--it is defense. No one else, of course, can participate as fully in the defense of our country as the Federal Government. 
   Unfortunately, we have had more troop deployments over the last couple years than we have had in 50 years. But the administration has requested funds that would cause military readiness to go down. We have been in Haiti, in Bosnia, in Kosovo, and a number of other places, which has been very expensive. We have found ourselves in the situation, with voluntary Armed Forces, where it is difficult to recruit people to come into the military. Probably the more difficult thing is to retain those people in the military who have been trained to be pilots or mechanics, or whatever, who can find, of course, much better jobs somewhere else. 
   Health care: Clearly, health care is a vital interest to all of us. Again, folks in Wyoming are interested in that, in particular, because the changes that have been made over the last couple of years have affected rural areas probably to more of an extreme than nonrural areas. We are moving, of course, into an era where very small hospitals find it most difficult. We have some towns in our State with hospitals that have an average occupancy of one or two acute-care beds. That is  very difficult. And there are shifts taking place. We have changed the definition of ``hospital'' so that HCFA, the funding agency, can fund hospitals that have less than full services, even emergency rooms, to move those patients off to somewhere else. 
   We passed the Patients' Bill of Rights. I hope one of the things that will happen before we leave is some change in the balanced budget amendment on Medicare. That will probably be an additional $15 billion over 10 years, to take away what we think were the overcuts that have been made by the agency that pays it out. So we will be moving forward on that. 
   Financial modernization: I think for the first time since the 1930s the whole financial picture has changed somewhat. That bill is prepared to come to the floor. We closed the deal last week. We have been trying for 10 years--and finally got that done--to change the regulations that were put in place during the Depression times to fit what is necessary now. 
   So we have accomplished a great deal in the budget: Social Security, education, defense, tax relief, health care, and now a banking bill--all things that are good for America--but yet without letting the Federal Government grow out of control. 
   It is legitimate to have different views, and we ought to have an exchange of views. There are different views everywhere. One of the basic differences here has to do, frankly, with the size and involvement of the Federal Government; it has to do with spending. The liberals, of course, want to have more taxes, more spending, put the Federal Government into more things, override the States because they think that is a better way to do it. It is a legitimate point of view. I do not agree with it. 
   We ought to try to limit those things that can best and must be done by the Federal Government. Do we raise money to do it? Of course. But after that we ought to let that be done closer to the people. 
   Those are the real issues. Sometimes they do not show up. We get to talking about details, but the basic philosophy is there and it is legitimate and we need to work at it. 
   I hope we can move forward. I think we have completed a good amount of work this year. We have some more to do. We have probably less than 2 weeks to do it. So I hope we move forward. 
   I now yield whatever time he might consume to the Senator from Oklahoma.

   Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, it has been an interesting morning to listen to the Senator from North Dakota talk a little bit about the economy and about spending. There are interesting figures in terms of growth. I do not happen to have one of the charts. I guess it is getting to be where you have to have a chart to speak, but I hope not. 
   Let's go back to the second half of the 1970s, when we had a Democrat-controlled Government. All spending grew 12.2 percent annually; nondefense discretionary spending grew 15 percent. 
   In the first half of the 1980s, all spending grew 10 percent, but nondefense discretionary spending was only 2.8 percent. Defense was where the money went--10 percent. 
   Then we scoot on down to currently. All spending grew in the second half of the 1990s, with this Republican-controlled Congress, 2.8 percent totally; nondefense discretionary spending was 1.4 percent. 
   If our goal over time is to control the size of Federal Government, if our goal is to be efficient, if our goal is to control spending, then these are the numbers; these are the figures. Really, spending is the key. 
   Of course, our friend on the other side of the aisle talked about having the largest tax increase in the history of the United States--which was true in 1993 with the Clinton tax increase. But what we really ought to talk about is the size of Government. 
   There is a great deal of talk about going into Social Security. Let me read this short letter dated September 30 from the Congressional Budget Office.  
   Dear Mr. Speaker: You requested that we estimate the impact of the fiscal 2000 Social Security surplus using CBO's economic and technical assumptions, based on a plan whereby net discretionary outlays for the year will be $592 billion.  
   That is the cap we put there.  
   CBO estimates this spending plan will not use any of the projected Social Security surplus for the year 2000.  
   We keep talking about that differently. That is the way that is. So one of the things that is interesting--I will not take long today, but we have differences of view here. We have differences of view in the country. There is nothing wrong with that. That is what the political system is about: To bring together people who have different views about attaining goals, even, indeed, different views about goals. So we ought to have legitimate arguments. That is what this system is about. 
   But we ought not to spin it off into things that we are not really able to document. We ought not to spin it off into motives and different kinds of political things. We ought to talk about the basic differences we have, and then decide whether we want more Federal Government or less; decide whether we want to spend more, send more of the decisions back to the State and local governments as opposed to one size fits all on the national level. 
   These are the real issues. 
   Mr. President, we ought to be talking about some of the positive things we have done this year. 
   Surplus: 2 years in a row with no deficit, for the first time in 42 years. Pretty good stuff. We even have a non-Social 
   Security surplus this year. We reduced Federal spending as a percentage of growth. 
   Unfortunately, we still have taxes as the highest percentage of gross national product we have had since World War II. Those things are hard to reconcile. Growth now is a little over 2 percent, compared to 10 percent in the early 1980s. 
   So these are the kinds of things we have done. We passed tax relief here. Unfortunately, the President chose to veto it. 
   Our budget goals, of course, for the rest of the year are: No Government shutdown; no new taxes; pay down the debt; protect Social Security. We are going to do those things. We are going to do it in the next 10 days. 
   Social Security: We talked a lot over the last few years about ``save Social Security first,'' but we have a plan to do that with individual accounts, taking the money off the table and letting it belong to the people who have paid it in, to earn additional money by having it invested in equities. 
   Those are the things we are prepared to do and have done. 
   Education: We have done a lot this year for education. We have increased spending for education, more than the President asked for. We have more flexibility in educational decisions so that parents and school boards and States can make those decisions. 
   I can tell you what is needed in Greybull, WY, is quite different than what is needed in Pittsburgh. And that is the way it ought to be. We have done that. We have done a number of things. 
   National security: For the first time, more money is going to defense than we have had before. We have had more deployments over the last few years in foreign countries than ever, and yet this administration has reduced the dollars that go there. We have changed that. 
   Health care, the Patients' Bill of Rights: We passed it here. Hopefully, we will get it passed. 
   A balanced budget on Medicare changes: We are working on that. 
   Rural provisions in Medicare: We will get that done. 
   Financial modernization is ready to come to the floor for the first time since the 1930s. 
   We have a lot of things to talk about and be proud of in this session. I am very pleased we have done it. Despite the partisan rhetoric and the tactics, we have had achievements in the budget, in Social Security, in education, in  defense, in tax relief, health care, and in finance and banking. I think we ought to move forward and make the most of those advantages that we have had. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

    Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of Wyoming's native sons, former Wyoming Governor and United States Senator Cliff Hansen. I am pleased that my colleague, Senator ENZI is joining me in sponsoring legislation to name the federal courthouse in Jackson, Wyoming, as the ``Clifford P. Hansen Federal Courthouse.'' 
   Wyoming has enjoyed a long history of outstanding leaders and strong individuals. These men and women have sought the best for our small towns with big expectations and in turn have exemplified what it really means to be a leader in their communities. 
   Senator Cliff Hansen stands with the other Wyoming statesmen that have helped make our state so special and her citizens proud. Today I join my colleagues and Wyoming people to honor him by designating the Jackson, Wyoming, federal courthouse in his name. 
   Cliff Hansen's career is well known and he has been a fixture of public service in Wyoming and the United States for more than 40 years. Beginning with the local school board, to Teton County Commissioner, the statehouse in Cheyenne as Wyoming's 26th Governor, and finally here as a distinguished member of the U.S. Senate. 
   Senator Cliff Hansen was so well regarded, his leadership so clear, that President Reagan asked him to be Secretary of the Interior not once, but twice. With his experience and expertise gained from working on issues involving public lands and the environment there is no doubt he would have done an excellent job had he chosen to accept. 
   His has been a remarkable career with a distinguished record. 
   Cliff Hansen and his wife Martha recently celebrated their 65th wedding anniversary. What an incredible accomplishment--one of many for this singular Wyoming family that continues to play a significant role in the Jackson Hole community in which they live. 
   With their children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren--the Hansen family is a colorful part of the fabric that makes Jackson and the surrounding areas unique. Cliff Hansen resides and enjoys life in Jackson, Wyoming under the immense shadow of the famed Grand Tetons. Like the Grand, he stands tall in that close community--dignified, multifaceted and solid in his grounding. Our goal as fellow public servants should be to aspire to climb to the same personal heights. 
   Senator Hansen is a man who embodies a mix of justice and compassion. That's a combination we need always to strive for. He is a leader, quick to care, astutely understanding and finding the best solutions to fit the need. Gracing the Federal Courthouse in his hometown with his name--considering that great legacy--is an appropriate symbol for what he has always worked for and achieved. 
   I join other Wyoming people who consider Governor, Senator, Cliff Hansen a worthy citizen. An honorable gentleman who continues to live up to the special significance I hope this act will bestow.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, several speakers were intending to be here to talk in morning business. With the untimely death of our friend JOHN CHAFEE, I think this time is going to be reserved for Members who wish to talk about the Senator and his life. I would like to do that for a moment. 
   I have had the opportunity, for my time in the Congress, to serve with JOHN CHAFEE on the committee of which he has been chair. I had the opportunity to become acquainted with certainly one of the most outstanding Senators who has ever been in the Senate. I will not go back over all the things our friends have already said. But each of us, I suppose, has a little different memory, a little different feeling.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor this morning and talk a little bit about where we are in the Senate, at least in my view, and where we are going. We are, of course, nearing the end of this session. Nobody knows precisely or exactly when we will be out of here, but it won't be long. We have to take a strong look, in my view, at what we have to do, and the things that are necessary to do. There are, of course, certain things that are required. 
   At this time of year, Congress maybe hasn't finished its annual ritual, but the fact is we have done a great deal. I am pleased with that. But we must, of course, finish the appropriations. The continuing resolution expires this week, but hopefully we will have the appropriations to the President. We will see what happens from there. 
   In addition to that, of course, I am very hopeful that at least one other issue will be undertaken, and that is to do something about the balanced budget amendment and the Medicare restrictions that are in place. 
   You might recall that Congress asked for some reduction in the cost of Medicare over a period of time to ensure a firming up in the fact that these dollars are being used as they should 
   be. Unfortunately, the administration has reduced that spending almost twice what was anticipated and, therefore, I  think it will be necessary for us to go back and do some things for all of Medicare and particularly, I might say, for rural areas and small hospitals in areas such as in Wyoming. 
   I think we have allowed ourselves to become a little bit off track. We have gotten involved in lengthy discussions of issues that are probably not particularly timely nor, indeed, perhaps even particularly appropriate, issues that did not need to be or were not ready to be discussed and debated this year and could well have been put off until another year. But, nevertheless, they have been discussed, and we are, in fact, still involved in some of those--the nuclear test ban treaty of course, being one of them. Now we are on campaign finance. 
   There have been extended debates brought about by the insistence of Members on the floor. We have also had a number of filibusters and threatened filibusters from the other side of the aisle in order to control what was occurring on the floor. 
   I haven't been here as long as have many Members of the Senate, but I can tell you I don't think that in the time I have been here I have seen such a contentious and combative situation. It is the most controversial session I believe--perhaps the most uncooperative--in terms of coming to terms with the things we need to do. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, of course, have brought issues to the floor, and we have had a number of filibusters and threatened filibusters. I guess the most interesting was the latest nuclear test ban treaty debate in which there was an insistence that we come on the floor with it, and then there was a cry of foul when it came up. That was a somewhat interesting and difficult issue. 
   We have had Members forcing issues to the floor that have had little or no support, but yet under the rules of the Senate they are entitled to be discussed and discussed for a length of time. In fact, we have had the feeling we are becoming too oriented toward accomplishing things. But, again, that is one point of view. 
   It seems to me we find the President now in the most political posture that I recall a President being in, criticizing the Senate for doing the things that we have a constitutional responsibility to do--treaties. We have the advise and consent responsibility on all treaties. That is in the Constitution. The same is true regarding nominees. That is our responsibility. I believe we have the right to do the things that we believe are right without being criticized. 
   At every opportunity, the President is calling everything a political vote. I find that paradoxical. There were allegations of racial voting on nominees for the Judiciary. I for one--and I know many others--did not even know the race of the person being voted upon. 
   The White House, trying to use many of these votes to breathe some life into a lame-duck President, makes it very difficult. We still have a responsibility. We have things to do. We have things to complete. We find ourselves in a confrontation, with the President threatening to disapprove appropriations. He has that right, as well. However, we ought to come together. We ought to talk about it. We ought to decide what we are going to do. We know we will fund the Government. We know we will go forward. I don't think anyone genuinely wants to shut down the Government. However, we are faced with that possibility. It worked out so well politically for the President a couple of years ago; he shut down the Government and we got the blame. I hope we don't use that technique again. 
   It is a fairly simple thing. It is very difficult, but we have a commitment to have a certain amount of spending--about $592 billion worth of spending--outside the mandatory appropriations. We have to make agreements to stay within that commitment. We are dedicated to the idea of not spending more than that because we have to go into Social Security. As difficult as it may be, that is the goal. That is the bottom line. We simply have to make the adjustments that are necessary to do that. I think that is reasonable and certainly not impossible. 
   Aside from that, it seems to me we have had a good year. We started this year as the majority party saying we were committed to ensuring a sound Social Security retirement system. We said we were here to help improve educational opportunities for our children, to expand economic opportunities for all Americans, to provide a strengthening of our national security to protect our freedoms. Those were the four things we set about to do. I believe the leadership and the Members have called for that. 
   Despite all the talk and concern about education in the appropriations, the Republican proposal has $537 million more than the President requested. We have passed a bill that increases flexibility and opportunity for the States, the local school boards, and the parents to make the necessary decisions in their school districts. The school districts in Basin, WY, have different needs than in Philadelphia, PA. To the extent the Federal Government has a role--which represents, by the way, about 7 percent of total educational spending; not a huge amount --that money should be able to be spent the way the people wish to spend it. They, after all, are responsible for the education of their children. 
   In our tax bill, which the President vetoed, there were several educational propositions, educational savings accounts, and student loan programs available, as well. Of course, the 
   President vetoed those bills. We have done a great deal in education. I think it is something of which we should be proud. 
   Everyone talks about Social Security. It is one of our most important issues. Everyone who has worked for a wage or worked in their own business has paid into Social Security. Our commitment is to have Social Security available not only for those who are now beneficiaries but, indeed, for those young people who have just begun to work. There has been a great deal of discussion. The President talked about saving Social Security, but, frankly, has put nothing forward. 
   We have done a couple of things. One is to have a Social Security lockbox to ensure we will not spend the Social Security money, and that will be a test of this budget. The other is to propose that we have the kind of Social Security program so at least a portion of those funds can be put into an individual account that belongs to the person who has been putting in the money. It can be invested directly in equities in the private sector to increase the return. I am pleased with that. 
   We have increased military spending by about $17 billion. It has gone down over the last several years despite the fact that the world is not safe. 
   Tax relief: We spent a great deal of time working on opportunities for all Americans to save some of the money they pay to taxes through marriage penalties, through estate tax reduction, capital gains reduction, and general reductions in rates. The President vetoed that because he wants to spend more money. 
   In health care, we have a Patients' Bill of Rights that I think is excellent. We also have committed ourselves to do something on the balanced budget. 
   These are the things on which we have made a great deal of progress. In addition, we recently had the test ban on nuclear testing. In a press conference last week, the President tried to deflect criticism about the lack of leadership he provided and the fact that not even a majority of this Senate supported it on a final vote by blaming it all on partisan politics, accusing the Republicans of making the world a more dangerous place. 
   Acting against the national interest? Nonsense. Let me give some canards. Neither the United States nor the Senate have changed their views on nuclear testing. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and Japan. We are not going to start testing; we have not changed our position. We have no plan to test. Our policies in that regard are exactly the same as they were before the vote. All we were saying in the vote was, this is not the treaty at this time, with these shortcomings. 
   The President tried to blame the Republicans for being in a partisan mode. The President should look at his own party. Democrats demanded we have a vote on this treaty or they would filibuster all action on the Senate floor. On September 18, the Senator from North Dakota said:  
   I intend to plant myself on the floor like a potted plant and object. I intend to object to other routine business of the Senate until the majority leader brings this treaty to the floor for debate and vote. I don't run this  place, but those who do should know this is going to be a rough place to run if you do not decide to bring this issue to a vote.  
   We brought it to a vote and apparently they got exactly what they demanded--a debate and vote. Before the President blames the Republicans, he ought to take a look at the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. The vote was not a vote against national security. In an attempt to frighten people, the President accused those who opposed it of threatening the national security, that no thinking person could possibly oppose it. 
   Let me list for the Senate some of the people whom the President dismissed: Henry Kissinger, six former Secretaries of Defense, four former CIA Chiefs, former Federal weapons lab Directors, two former Chiefs of Staff, the President's own head of Strategic Command at the time the treaty was negotiated, three former National Security Advisers. It goes on and on. 
   This idea of isolationism is ridiculous. The idea of maintaining the U.S. military strength is not. That, in the view of many, gives the best opportunity for security. 
   Now we are involved, of course, in this question of campaign finance. It is a legitimate issue, a good issue. We have been into it before. We passed bills in the 1970s. We passed bills in the 1980s. It has not changed an awful lot. Some people suggest it has been blown completely out of hand. I suggest it is probably not true. The expenditures in the average congressional district have gone up about 3.6 percent a year since 1986. That is hardly runaway. It amounts to about $1 per voter in most congressional districts. 
   But I believe--and, for myself, I think there is some consensus in the Senate--it is an important issue. I have said, and I continue to say, I support some changes. I would like to see more disclosure. It seems to me that is the most important thing. If there is going to be money--and, indeed, there has to be money--if people are to understand the issues and have a chance to speak out, to have the freedom of speech, to have the opportunity to participate, it has to be open. But I think there should be disclosure. There should be disclosure right up until the end of the election, and we can do that. We should enforce the laws already on the books, as is the case with many other matters of enforcement. I think we have to protect the constitutional rights of individuals to participate. 
   I would support some limit on soft money. I do not know how, constitutionally, that would be accepted by the Supreme Court. Nevertheless, I would set some limit and support that. But I would not support doing away with it. I would not support eliminating it. I would not support the bill as it is proposed now. 
   We can contribute to the integrity of the process and help return more confidence to it. I have thought about this a lot. People who support Members, or people who are running, do so because of what they believe. They do not change their beliefs because they received some support. As you look around for whom you are going to support in the election, you support the person whose beliefs are similar to yours. I support things in my State--I suppose some people call them special interests--because they are important to my State. Those are the industries at which most people in my State work. Those are the kinds of industries that we need to have a vibrant economy. Of course I support those, not because of some contribution. 
   In summary, I wish we were in a little different situation in our relationship on both sides of this aisle and in our relationship with the White House, so we could really look at some issues, come out with what seems best to us as a group, and move forward. 
   On the other hand, I am very pleased with many of the things we have done. I can tell you, most people in my State, when we talk about doing all these things, have a limit in their minds as to what the Congress ought to be doing, what is the role of the Federal Government. It is not up to the Congress to solve every problem. On the contrary, we are better off to push more and more of that government closer to the people, where they can make the decisions, not the one-size-fits-all kind of thing some people here would like to have. 
   We are ready to move on and finish up. I look forward to it. I hope we can conclude our work and do the best things for the country. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join my colleagues Senator JOHNSON, Senator GRASSLEY and Senator KERREY in introducing the ``Rural America Needs Competition to Help Every Rancher Act of 1999'' (RANCHER). 
   Additional regulation of meat packing companies has become necessary because of a loophole my colleagues and I have long been concerned about: the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 does not clearly and definitively address meat packers owning livestock for slaughter. This legislation will prohibit meat packing companies from owning and feeding livestock, with the exception of producer-owned cooperatives defined by the majority of ownership interest in the cooperative being held by co-cop members that own, feed, or control livestock and provide those livestock to the co-op. An exemption for cooperatives is included as recognition and reward to those producers who have invested the resources necessary to enhance their market edge. 
   In placing a prohibition on meat packing companies, our efforts today will be branded as anti-competitive and in support of ``big government,'' versus the ``free market.'' However, our intentions are precisely the opposite--we are introducing this legislation with goal of restoring competition to our livestock markets. In fact, this legislation is long overdue. In recent years, livestock markets have become increasingly more concentrated, leaving individual producers with fewer options for selling their products. 
   According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the four top meat packing firms control roughly 80 percent of today's slaughter market, while less than 20 years ago, the top four firms controlled only 36 percent of the market. Over the last year we have watched the on-farm price of commodities plummet, while at the same time, retail prices have remained constant or even increased. The problem of price disparity, I believe is in part, attributable to growing market concentration. Since it is evident that market concentration exists, this legislation is a first step in working to restore fair market prices to our producers. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this legislation--it is an admirable initiative that seeks to strengthen financial solvency for our family producers. I hope our colleagues in the Senate will recognize the benefits this effort will generate for producers and rural communities across the United States and will join us in restoring true market competition.

   Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for the work that has been done on both sides. I know this is a very difficult issue, one about which Members have very different ideas concerning resolution. I do appreciate the work that has been done. 
   Certainly, one of the things that has occurred and has an impact on what we are talking about today has been the difficult times we are having in agriculture. In my State of Wyoming, we have basically three areas of economic activity. This is one of the three; minerals is the other. Both have not been good lately. Fortunately, there are some signs of improvement, particularly in the livestock area, which is of course the most important part of Wyoming's agriculture. 
   I come to the floor to talk about what we need to do in the long run. We are talking in this bill about a great deal of fairly short-term remedies. I don't argue with those particularly. I guess maybe we have spent a little more money than we should, used the emergency technique for some things that probably are not bona fide emergencies. On the other hand, we have a great deal to do in our community in agriculture and all that needs to be done. 
   No one doubts the urgency of providing the short-term relief, whether it be from emergencies in weather, from emergencies in markets, or whether it be other kinds. 
   But the fact is that this, in my view, is not the long-term solution to the problems we have. Producers in Wyoming generally do not favor returning to the Government farm programs. I think they would much prefer the idea of being in the marketplace, producing for the marketplace, developing new markets. 
   We had an agricultural seminar in our State recently, and those were the things that were talked about--that we do need to develop markets; we need overseas markets because we are great producers. We produce efficiently and at good prices. But in order to do that, we have to continue to develop markets. I think we have to, in addition, reduce the kinds of restrictions that prohibit the sort of production we choose. So we need to follow up, and I think many of the agricultural leaders in the Senate believe we have some things we have to do to make Freedom to Farm work. Those are the things we must do in following up to make that marketplace work. 
   One of them, of course, is to reduce unfair trade barriers throughout the world. We have a great many of those, and probably the most pressing one is the European Union, where they have found various ways through tariff barriers, or nontariff barriers, to keep agricultural products in the country moving--beef, for example, which is important to me and others. 
   We have a great opportunity, as we go forward with the WTO meetings in Seattle soon, to take to that meeting the kinds of things that are important to us. I happen to be involved as chairman of the subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific rim. So I have been involved with some of the countries with which we deal to a great extent. 
   Japan has a 40-percent tariff on American beef. This is not a realistic thing to do. If we are going to have trade organizations and trade treaties that are designed to level the playing field and be fair, those kinds of things should not happen. We have some opportunities in China, as a matter of  fact, where they moved this summer to suggest they would take more wheat and also more beef. So we have some great opportunities to do that. We just this week had some hearings with respect to the NAFTA treaty with Canada. In this instance, we had some hearings before the International Trade Commission to seek enforcement of those trade agreements. 
   So what I am saying, of course, is that these are the kinds of things, over the long term, that we have to do to cause American agriculture to produce for the market and to be able to produce from that market a reasonable price. We can do that. 
   Unilateral sanctions. We have had a great deal of talk and discussion about unilateral sanctions. I think most people would agree that unilateral sanctions are not an effective tool for foreign policy. Basically, what we do is bar our own producers from selling in those particular places and gain no advantage from it. If there have to be sanctions, they certainly ought not to be unilateral. They should be through some kind of a trade organization. 
   So that, coupled with enforcement, I believe, of trade agreements is something that agricultural people are very anxious about. Obviously, foreign trade is not the only remedy, but it is one of the major ones. It was unfortunate that at the time we were moving into the marketplace in agriculture, we had the currency crisis in Asia, a place where we have a potential for great markets. Of course, now, hopefully, the Asian market 
   is strengthening and we will find we will be able to move back there again. 
   As I mentioned, foreign trade is not the only remedy and not the only issue on which we ought to be working. I think we have to have some other innovative avenues to spur market competition. I think one of them that, again, was talked about at our seminar in Wyoming was producer-owned cooperatives that move on through to the retail marketing of these products. 
   I think it is pretty clear, particularly in the case of beef--or at least it is very appropriate there--where you had a major reduction in the price received by producers but no reduction in the retail market, no reduction in the grocery store when you went there--so there is some sort of a problem in between. We think producer-owned cooperatives may be a way to do the processing and to ensure that, indeed, producers are given their fair share of the final product. Another is niche marketing. A great number of things are taking place on the Internet, where people are marketing products in specialties areas. 
   I think we need to look at the concentration of packers, where there are only two or three packers that handle 80 to 85 percent of the livestock. I think there are some similarities in the grain industry, where very few buyers are available to go into the marketplace. So you have to ask the question, Is there, indeed, a competitive, fair marketplace? We have the Packers and Stockyard Act which is designed to do that. Over the years, we have appealed to the Justice Department a number of times to look at whether there was, indeed, a monopoly factor. They have said that, under the law, there is not. Not everybody agrees with that. Nevertheless, that has been the result. 
   We are going to, I think sometime this week, introduce a proposition that would have to do with packers' ownership of livestock and see if we can do something about reducing the potential for monopolies so the market prices are there. In this bill, I think there is a market-price-revealing requirement that is very important. 
   Financial solvency, of course, for agriculture is always difficult. 
   Crop insurance. The Senator who is presiding at this time continues to do a great deal with crop insurance, and we need to do that--at least from the weather emergency standpoint. That is the kind of thing that needs to be in place to protect the investment of farmers. In the form of tax relief, we have tried to do some things to extend income averaging. As you can understand, because some years are good and some are not, there needs to be the ability to income average. 
   There is interest in estate taxes. Most agricultural people have their estate in property, and they make very little profit often, but it accumulates toward their estate under the circumstances, and after they get beyond the exemption of 55 percent, that estate has to be paid in taxes. That is extremely difficult for agriculture. So we are going to be doing some things there. 
   Regulatory relief is particularly important in States such as ours, where 50 percent of the land belongs to the Federal Government, where much of agricultural activity, particularly livestock, is carried on, on public lands. The restrictions sometimes are very difficult. 
   So I am pleased we are going forward with this bill. As is the case with many, it probably isn't the way I would do it if I 
   were in charge. But I am not in charge, nor is anyone else. So when you put it all together, it is difficult. I think the committee has done the best they could and has done a good job, but we need to focus on the long-term prosperity in agriculture, the family farm. We need to focus on continuing to keep U.S. producers competitive in the world market and, finally, opening those markets throughout the world for our agricultural products on a fair basis, so we are not kept out of those markets by nontariff barriers, and, in addition, of course, to develop domestically the things we do. 
   So, again, I say to the chairman, the Senator from Mississippi, good job. He has worked very hard in doing this, and we are pleased that this bill will be sent to the White House. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which revises an outdated and constricting statute for the number of federal sodium leases which can be held by any single producer within a state. This limitation is damaging the economic viability of an environmental responsible and critical mining industry for our country. The soda ash industry has been operating under the present acreage limitation for five decades. This cap for lease holdings is the oldest acreage limitation under the Mineral Leasing Act. In fact, sodium is the only mineral subject to the Act which has not had an increase since the law was amended in 1948. It is out of date with the competitive and technological advances in the industry and needs to be changed as we move into the next century. 
   Specifically this legislation provides the Secretary of the Interior with discretion to increase the federally held acreage of individual sodium producers; the same additional discretionary authority he has had for some time for other mineral categories affected by this law. It would increase the current limitation from 15,360 acres per producer, to 30,720 acres. 
   The Mineral Leasing Act set forth these limits to ensure that no single entity can control too much of any single mineral reserve. This remains an important objective. A lease limitation ensures that there is sufficient competition, while providing an incentive for development of these reserves and ensures a reasonable rate of return to the Federal Treasury. My bill is consistent with these objectives and seeks only to conform the present limitation to current economic and international conditions. Indeed I am pleased that this bill has the full support of the Wyoming Mining Association, including smaller sodium lease holders, who have traditionally been concerned increasing acreage. 
   Mr President, I offer this bill after carefully reviewing the need for it in light of current conditions affecting the soda ash industry in my state. In my examination, I have been reminded that U.S. soda ash producers, four (of five) of which are in our state, are extremely competitive with one another for a relatively flat domestic market. And, they are also faced with stiff international competition. 
   I believe this legislation is necessary to sustain the global competitiveness of the U.S. soda ash industry. Since our state is blessed with the largest known deposits of trona in the world, I am proud to say that the United States sodium industry is also the world's low cost supplier of soda ash. U.S. produced soda ash, critical to glass manufacture, is accountable for a $400 million positive contribution to our balance of trade. Today, the U.S. soda ash industry comprises five active producers--four in my home state--generating some 12 million tons of soda ash per year, or approximately a third of the world's demand. 
   But I have learned we cannot take these producers for granted. Like so many other industries basic to our economy such as steel, paper, aluminum, copper, and so on, the soda ash mines must take the measures necessary to stay competitive. I know, as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, that many countries have make it difficult to export U.S. soda ash. They have erected tariff and non-tariff barriers to support their own less efficient domestic producers. 
   For this season, U.S. producers have formed the American Natural Soda Ash Corporation (ANSAC), in recognition that the growth of U.S. soda ash is dependent on its ability to effectively export. ANSAC is the sole authorized exporter of soda ash and is wholly owned by the six U.S. sodium producers. It accounts for the employment of some 20,000 people in the U.S. and exports more than $400 million in soda ash to 45 different countries. 
   This is but one example of how our domestic industry has taken the steps necessary to compete effectively abroad. In addition, the producers in my state are making major investments in moderizing their facilities and sustaining the level of capital investment necessary to continue to be competitive both at home and abroad. The start-up cost for a new soda ash operation is estimated to be at least $350 million, and to develop a world class mine, $150 million. This is largely due to the fact that soda ash is mined underground and thus requires a sophisticated processing plant to turn raw ore into the finished products. This is simply the reality of what is required to stay competitive. 
   At this cost a new entrant, as well as existing producers, must have a predictable ``mine plan.'' A primary component of such a plan is a predictable level of reserves that will last several decades. The legislation I am introducing today would help provide this predictability by giving the Secretary the discretion to raise lease limits on a case-by-case basis if the producer can show it is in need of additional reserves to maintain its operations. 
   Producers need to know of mine expansion is possible in order to develop structural design plans which are safe, efficient and maximize the large economic outlays. This is the predictability that any manufacturer needs when contemplating a major capital investment. And in the end, it is the capital required, rather than the acreage available, the must be weighed by new entrants. 
   I would like to note that despite consolidated in the Wyoming trona patch, there is an anticipated new entrant to the soda ash business in our neighboring state of Colorado. Moreover, in Wyoming, six other leaseholders have substantial holdings that could be translated into active production. This bill does not discourage their entry. In fact, by raising the current cap on acreage holdings, it creates an incentive for additional purchase by these holders, one of whom already exceeds the existing limitation. 
   Raising the acreage limitation for trona is also consistent with good environmental and safety practices followed by this industry. Much of the currently mined out acreage is essential to proper ventilation of ongoing operations and therefore critical mine safety. In addition, the mechanically mined out sections are also available for proper tailings disposal, thus avoiding environmental degradation elsewhere. This is a practice encouraged by our Wyoming State Department of Environmental Quality. 
   In summary, Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today provides critical changes in existing statutes in order to sustain the economic viability of an environmental responsible and critical mining industry in our country. The current sodium lease limitation is approximately one-third of the per state Federal lease cap for coal potassium, and one-sixteenth the lease acreage cap for oil and gas. After passing the Mineral Leasing Act in 1948, Congress and the Bureau of Land Management have revised acreage limits for other minerals to meet the needs of these industries consistent with good mining and environmental practices. In light of the conditions I have described, I believe it is time we recognize the need to update the lease limitation for the trona industry as well.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments about where we are, what we are faced with this afternoon, and what we are faced with over the next few weeks. We have heard, of course, a great deal from my friends on the other side of the aisle, some of which is a little hard to understand, I believe, but nevertheless I guess legitimate conversation. 
   We, of course, are prepared now to take a vote within the next hour, or less, on the idea of a continuing resolution. It is not a new idea. It is one that has been used a number of times. Would we all like to be through now? Of course we would. This matter of appropriations is a very difficult task. 
   I must tell you at the outset, one of the bills I have had in since I have been in the Congress--I brought it with me from the legislature in Wyoming--says we ought to have a biennial budget. Instead of going through this every year, we ought to do it every 2 years: Budget 1 year, appropriations the other year, which would give us more opportunity to have the kind of oversight Congress is responsible to do, but we do not do that. We go through this each year. Unfortunately, the appropriations becomes kind of the direction for the Congress, which is wrong. It seems to me we ought to set our priorities, do that in the authorizing committees, and then we fund it. 
   The process, of course, is to have a budget. The budget was passed this year on time. The budget is designed to break down the total revenue, the total amount we are willing to spend, break it down by various subcommittees within the appropriations, and those are the amount of dollars with which 
   each has to work. So we have done that, of course. 
   This is a pretty positive year in many ways. I certainly wish we were further along. I think everyone does for various reasons. I have a few ideas as to why we are not, I might say to my friends on the other side. But there are some positive things about which we ought to talk. How long has it been, I say to my friend, how long has it been since we have had a balanced budget? How long has it been since we have had income more than our expenditures? Has it been 25 years? Has it been 30 years? I think so. I think so. So this is kind of a positive thing about which we are talking. 
   This year's caps were less than last year's. Why? Because last year we took some out of this year to pay for it. This year's caps were less than last year's. I would like to stay with the caps; I voted for the caps. But when we bring  up the kind of emergencies that my friend from North Dakota insisted on in agriculture--good idea? Sure. Nevertheless, that is over the caps, isn't it? That is an expenditure, and we have had a good deal of that. 
   We have some positive things. We will not get into Social Security. We have not gotten into Social Security. That is one of the things we are dedicated not to do. We had about $14 billion, I believe, in this budget, that is not Social Security, and we are not going to spend Social Security. That is a commitment that we have. 
   What are the pressures? The pressures have constantly been, from the White House, from the other side of the aisle, for more spending. That is the principle of this administration: Spend more. Spend more taxes. 
   We are not willing to do that. On the contrary, we have been dedicated to keeping spending down, keeping Government size down. So it is not an easy project. 
   I am not an appropriator. I am not familiar with the processes that have gone on internally within the committee. Talk about not being involved--I don't know that. But I do know this has been a very difficult task. I am told within these 13 bills, about 12 of them that have pretty much been completed on this floor are within the spending caps--except for the emergencies. Emergencies in military? Of course. Not a bad idea--Kosovo, all those kinds of things that were here to do something to strengthen the military, to which everyone on this floor agrees. 
   These are the kinds of things, certainly, that got us where we are. One of the reasons it has been difficult, of course, it has been hard to move things on the floor. We, just this last week, have gone through a couple of filibusters, as a matter of fact, in which the very folks who have been up this afternoon talking participated. That kept us for 2 or 3 days talking about MMS, Minerals Management Service. That is one of the reasons we are where we are. It has been difficult to move along that way. But that is the way a legislative body works. 
   We tried very hard to do some things to ensure Social Security would be kept as it was--the Social Security lockbox. How many times did we bring that up? There was unwillingness to accept it on the other side of the aisle. 
   They did not want to do it, so we put that aside. 
   They have not been willing to talk about what we want to do with Social Security and individual accounts so that the money will be there. 
   When there is surplus money in this place, it will be spent. Could we get tax relief? No. No, our friends on the other side of the aisle did not want to do that; we ought to keep this money here so we can spend it. That is how we get into some of these things. 
   I am persuaded there has to be a system if you have excess money: You either have to get it out to people on Social Security, put it in those accounts, or you have to give it back to the people who paid it, if there is an excess amount of money. 
   No, they do not want to do that. What they want to do is spend more of it. That is where we got into this. 
   Gridlock? Yes, indeed, we have had some gridlock. I have been here for less than one term, but I do not believe I have seen as much gridlock as there has been this year in terms of bringing up amendments to bills we have had to take 2 or 3 days to deal with, constantly bringing up an agenda that was different from the agenda that was on the floor. 
   These are the things that, to me, certainly, have created difficulties in getting our task done. I agree, however, that is our task, that is what we are here to do, and I am disappointed we have not gotten it done by the end of the fiscal year. But we have not. 
   We are not going to allow ourselves to get into the position--I do not think anyone wants to have that happen--where there is a closure and a shutdown of the Government. Certainly we are not interested in allowing that to happen, or encouraging it to happen, or promoting an opportunity for it to happen. Indeed, we want to move forward with the appropriations as they should be dealt with, and we are persuaded that is the thing we are going to talk about doing. 
   Again, however, I do think there are some very positive things that have happened. For the first time in 25 years, we are not spending Social Security money, we are not spending deficit money in this budget. It has been a very long time since that has happened. 
   Mr. President, I suspect what we ought to do is move forward. I yield back the time allotted to the Members on this side of the aisle and ask--I was going to ask for the yeas and nays, but I don't think I can do that. I ask unanimous consent that the vote on adoption of House Joint Resolution 68 occur at 5:15 this evening and that paragraph 4 of rule XII be waived.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, who is very knowledgeable and, of course, is involved. I want to talk about an interesting thing that has to do with the last year Democrats were in charge of the majority--fiscal year 1993. I don't think it is an excuse, but I think it is interesting, given all the conversation we have had. 
   These are the dates that the appropriations bills were passed in 1993: The foreign assistance bill was passed in the Senate on September 30 and approved on September 30; the legislative branch bill, of course, which has to do with operating the Congress, was passed early, August 6, and approved on August 11; Treasury-Postal was approved in the Senate October 26 and signed on October 28--this, of course, was the same fiscal year we are dealing with now--Energy and Water was passed on October 26, signed on October 27. 
   This was the year the Democrats were in the majority. This is the kind of thing they are talking about today. 
   Military construction was passed in the Senate on October 19, signed on October 21; VA-HUD, October 28, when it was approved; District of Columbia, October 29; Agriculture, October 21; Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, October 21; Commerce, Justice, and State, October 27; Interior, passed November 11 and signed; emergency supplementals, of course, were before that; Transportation, October 27; Defense, November 11; the continuing resolution, the first one, on September 30, and a further continuing resolution on October 29. 
   This was 1993. The Democrats were in the majority. The idea of a continuing resolution is not a brand new idea. 
   Mrs. LINCOLN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are facing the last week for the consideration of appropriations bills for the next fiscal year. I expect we will end up having a continuing resolution--I hope so--so we can finish our work without an interruption, the closing down of the Government. 
   One of the issues, of course, that is most important to all of us is that of education. I wanted to talk--and will be joined by several of my colleagues during the course of this hour--a little bit about strengthening education. 
   The Republicans have had, and continue to have, a strong education agenda, one that reflects the view we share on this side of the aisle, that of returning control to the State and local levels so more of the decisions can be made by the school boards, by States, by parents, making Federal programs more flexible so there can be assistance from the Federal Government but at the same time allowing local governments to have the flexibility to adjust educational programs and school programs so they fit. 
   My State of Wyoming is unique in that we have lots of space and not too many people. Chugwater, WY, would have quite a different educational approach than Philadelphia. I think those  differences need to be recognized. We have worked hard to move towards block granting of Federal money directly to States and to local school districts. I happen to believe that is a very important item in terms of Federal participation in elementary and secondary education. 
   There are differences of view as a matter of fact as to what the role of the Federal Government is with regard to elementary and secondary education. Many believe, of course, that it is the primary role of the local governments. I share that view. I share the view, however, that the Federal Government can assist, and in doing that, it needs to assist in a way that local officials can prevail. 
   Underlying this debate that we will hear a great deal about today and every day is a fundamental philosophical difference as 
   to how you approach education. The Democrat approach is to create a series of new mandates and new programs such as 100,000 federally funded teachers to deal with class size. There is a different approach as to classroom units depending on where you are. Most States--I believe 43 out of 50--have this 18 to 1 ratio about which they talk. The Democrats are talking about federally funded school construction and afterschool programs, all of which sounds great and probably has some merit, but the fact is we ought to be thinking more about funding the programs that are already there, such as IDEA, those kinds of programs, than we should be talking about expanding into new programs. Democrats don't like the idea of letting local people make the decisions. They continue to want the educational bureaucracy in Washington to call the shots. 
   That is a fundamental difference, legitimate difference of views. There are those who generally respect that idea and those of us who do not. Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate between the basic differences of view as they get tangled up with the details of dollars. 
   But it is the local people, it is you and me as we serve on the school boards, as I have and many of you, not the bureaucrats in Washington, who really need to decide what the classroom unit in our schools ought to be, whether they need a new gymnasium or something else. 
   Those are the key issues about which we need to talk. It is not the issue of whether or not we want the Federal Government to participate. The issue is how it participates, how much more regulation goes along with this participation, and taxes, of course, as well. 
   The Taxpayer Relief Act, which was vetoed last week by the President, had over $500 billion in family tax relief. Parents could have used this money to help educate their children. Specific educational provisions totaled $11.3 billion in this tax bill the President vetoed--educational savings accounts, interest deductions for student loans, deductions for employer-provided tuition assistance, these kinds of things that would give families the opportunity to do more with their educational programs. 
   Congress had made substantial progress earlier this year with the passage of the Ed-Flex bill. I am hopeful the principal sponsor of the Ed-Flex bill, who is now presiding, will have an opportunity to share with us a little more of what that means. It is one of the big things we have done this year in terms of education. It allows district waivers of Federal requirements. This is the direction we really need. We need to let the schools and the districts make their decisions. That is really where we are in much of the discussion at this time. 
   There will be some resolutions talked about today, introduced by the majority leader and the minority leader, which deal directly with the funding and how the funding is handled. I think they are extraordinary items we will discuss in relation to whether or not this administration has listened more to the polls and tried to do things that kind of pick up the people's attention or whether they really have been involved in seeking to strengthen education through the kinds of activities we have had. 
   I yield to my friend, the Senator from Alabama.

   The issue really has to do with MMS. It has to do with the development and enforcement of regulations. Nearly everyone who has gotten up so far has said: I do not know much about this; our State does not do this. And they have gone on to talk at length about it. 
   I have been involved with this. I have been at the meetings with MMS. Our State is the largest State involved in terms of oil royalties. 
   We ought to focus on the real issue for a while. I want to do that.

   Mr. THOMAS. It certainly seems that way. I think there is a real paradox here. On the one hand we are talking about more money for education and at the same time voting to reduce that amount for education. So I think that is difficult. 
   Let me go back to the topic that we are really here to discuss and that is MMS's proposed oil valuation rule. I rise in strong support of the Hutchison amendment. I have been working on this issue for a long time. I have been involved in numerous meetings. I have worked with the oil companies. I have worked with the school districts. I have worked with the State of Wyoming. 
   We are working toward find a workable solutions for everyone, which seems to be ignored by the folks on the other side. We are trying to find a way, with these regulations, for Minerals Management to make them work better. We have met with them. The oil companies want to make it work better. We want to give the Congress an opportunity to participate in this matter of making regulations. 
   So that is where we really are. 
   The domestic companies, of course, already pay significant amounts of money. Someone was saying here that 95 percent pay but the others do not. That is simply not true but if it were, that is an enforcement issue. We have regulations now. The problem is, the regulations and the proposed regulation are not workable. 
   Talking about having a price that is posted, that fits everywhere, that is not the way the oil business works. It is quite different in Wyoming than in Oklahoma. The idea of, where do you take the value? do you take it at the wellhead? that is what the contract says. But if you have to carry it, as an oil producer, out 10 miles to where it can be sold, it is quite a different cost that goes into it. These are the kinds of issues that are involved. 
   These folks who have been talking this afternoon would make you think people were trying to do away with this. That is not the case at all. It is terribly unfair. It is not the issue. The issue is to work together with MMS and get these regulations enforced. It is relatively simple, frankly. 
   I have to tell you, we talked some about the impact it has on Iowa, which is nothing; talked about the impact it has on Nevada, which is almost nothing because there is no production there. 
   Let me tell you a little about our counties. We have 23 counties in Wyoming. Here is one, Park County: 82 percent Federal land. We have another one that is 80 percent Federal land: Big Horn County. These are places where jobs, where the tax base, where schools are financed largely by mineral production. 
   We have mineral production now. Do we want to change the method of taxing? Fine. But we want to do it along with the Congress. We want to do it along with the producers. We want to make it work and not just be something that is to be done by MMS without consultation with industry and other involved. That is really quite simple.

<DOCNO>106-thomas-wy-25-19990923</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMAS. There is a great deal of involvement here. We have to talk a little bit about this industry. We have now, what, approximately 55 percent of foreign oil that comes into this country. Our oil people are stressed to keep it going. The oil business has been in something of a depression. We had oil down in the $6-, $7-, $8-a-barrel range in Wyoming. That is not to say there ought not to be regulations, that there ought not to be the kind of royalty rules that can be lived by. That is what we are working for. 
   If you came in from Mars and listened to what has been talked about over the last hour, you would think we did not have anything except a bunch of robber barons. That is not true--absolutely not true. 
   So I hope we can go forward with this, we can go ahead and work in the next year to put these royalty rules together, as it should be, to put it together in a way that is fair. 
   We have proposed regulations. We now have some changes in personnel in MMS that I think might make it work quite a bit better. We have some changes now coming forth at the Assistant Secretary's level. 
   We really need to get down to some facts and get away from all this hyperbole about what people are not paying, and people are cheating, and all these things. If that is true, that is an enforcement issue that ought to be dealt with by the Federal Government. 
   The West does have a unique relationship with the Federal Government. As I mentioned, all of us have a great deal of our land that is there, a great deal of our resources. We are dependent largely on mineral resources, along with agriculture and tourism, for our economy. So we need to have an economy that has jobs, that creates a tax base, that does the kinds of things that this industry does. 
   So I am really interested in us moving forward beyond these types of arguments brought up by the other side of the aisle and get something accomplished. We have talked about this now, and we have had several votes on this, as a matter of fact. We had 60 votes to move forward. We are ready to go forward with the Interior bill and do some things that have to be done in the next week and a half. We owe it to the American people. 
   I am really distressed by the idea of standing around wasting time on an issue that has pretty well been summed up and should be completed. We have already finished it, but we continue to go on and on here on the floor, I guess for political reasons. I cannot think of any other reason we continue to go on as long as we have. 
   One of the things, of course, that is most difficult from time to time in dealing with the Federal Government is the Federal regulations that are onerous and difficult. They make it very hard for businesses. 
   By the way, many of the businesses in Wyoming--and the oil business--are small businesses, independent producers. Many of them are stripper wells and down to 15 barrels or so per day. These are not all the mammoth companies, and so on, they talk about. This is an industry that is tremendously important to our State. 
   By the way, our students do receive a great deal of support from this source, which is our principal source, of course, for funding schools and doing the other things we do in our State. 
   Efforts will go forward to continue to complete the regulations and the rules. That is really what we are aiming toward. That is really what we ought to do. MMS needs to work with industry and come up with some workable regulations. 
   Talking about schools not having the money--the money is there now. As the Senator from Idaho indicated, there have been diversions from that pot of money by the very people who are continuing to talk about needing more. It seems to be something of an irony to do it that way. 
   I guess I have been particularly concerned about shifting the focus of our discussion today on an MMS proposed rule over to campaign finance, which we heard talked about for 30 minutes this morning. It is not relevant at all to what we are doing. And the implication that everyone who is for a workable rule is somehow a product of the contributions, I am offended by this. I am. I think it is a very unproductive kind of an argument. 
   I hope we can move forward, get this behind us, that we can get this job done. We can do it, and it can be done. By working with MMS, we and industry can come up with a workable rule. We are on our way to doing that now.

They did not mention Ed-Flex, one of the most important education bills that has been passed in this Congress, which allows families and school boards and States to have more say in education. They didn't talk about the tax bill which provides an opportunity for families to invest and save their  money so it can be used for education. They did not talk about standards and accountability, the fact we are going to take up these bills, the elementary school and secondary education bill, or Social Security, where we have done something about the proposal there, or the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. 
   It is interesting; when they talk about some of the things they would like to see happen, they somehow forget about the things we have done. I guess that indicates we do have a different view. It is proper. It is perfectly legitimate to have a different view about how we accomplish the things we are about. 
   Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma such time as he may consume.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for sharing the results of the hearing he had this morning. It is one of the real serious issues before the Senate, as is the case with the Senator from Oklahoma when he talks about the military problems in Puerto Rico. We have a lot of things with which to deal. 
   Most importantly, of course, is finishing our appropriations work. The end of the fiscal year occurs within 2 weeks. We will have at that time all the appropriations bills to the President. We intend to do that. It is difficult, of course, to go through the appropriations process and stay within those boundaries we have given ourselves, to stay within the boundaries of the caps, to stay within the boundaries of available funds and, maybe most important, to stay within spending limits without reaching into Social Security funds, which I think everyone is committed not to do. 
   There is a great difference of philosophy about how we do this. It seems to me we need to continue to think. There are those who legitimately want to see more government, more Federal Government, more involvement, more programs, and others who believe there ought to be a limited Federal Government--that, indeed, the role of the Federal Government is limited. 
   I had the opportunity yesterday to celebrate with four junior highs in my hometown of Casper, WY, the 212th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution. These were 9th graders. It was great fun. Some of them had on Uncle Sam suits in red, white, and blue. They all signed their own copy of the Constitution. One of the issues talked about by these 9th graders was the 10th amendment. The 10th amendment says the Federal Government's duties are spelled out in the Constitution. If they are not, they are left to the States or the people. It was interesting to talk about that. These young people who read that say: What are some of the things that our Government is doing? Of course, there is a legitimate debate about that. 
   Each year, as we come into the appropriations process, it seems to me we miss an opportunity to have evaluated where we want to go, what we legitimately want to do, and then fund it. Unfortunately, we get into the funding proposition before we have decided what it is we want to do; maybe more importantly, before we have had the opportunity to measure the effectiveness of what is in place. 
   That is one of the reasons many Members are seeking to have a biennial budget--so that the appropriations process only takes place every other year. In that case, agencies have a longer time to know what their budget is. 
   The key is that the Congress has oversight responsibility. Indeed, it should be looking at the expenditures; it should be looking at programs and setting priorities; it should be decided how effective they are and what the expenditures have been. 
   We had a little example this morning. About a year ago, three Members asked the GAO to do an examination of the cost of Presidential travel. They came in with their primary report yesterday. Even though there are a great many trips to be made, this President has made more trips than any other President in recent history. We asked that three trips be examined--a trip to Chile, a trip to China, and a trip to Africa--to see what it cost taxpayers. 
   The trip to Chile. Chile is not too far. There were a couple 
   of stops. It cost $10.5 million; 592 people traveled with the President, 109 from the White House. That was the least expensive trip. 
   The trip to China last year was almost $19 million; 510 people traveled, 123 from the White House. 
   These are the type of things at which we need to look. I think it is perfectly legitimate for the President to travel. Is it legitimate to have these costs? 
   Africa. There was contact with six countries. It cost nearly $43 million to visit Africa. Mr. President, 1,300 people traveled with the President, 205 from the White House. 
   These are the kind of expenses we should evaluate. These are the things at which we ought to look. These are the areas we ought to say: Yes, there ought to be trips, but $43 million for a trip to Africa is a bit expensive and a little extensive. 
   That is what the oversight is all about. I think we need to be sure we evaluate those things. We need to see if programs now in place, programs that are now being funded, are still as necessary as they were when they began, or do they need to be changed. There is a constituency that builds up around programs. Any change is resisted. That is not how to run any other business. We have to take a look to see if it is still effective, see what the mission is, see if that mission is being carried out, see if the dollars could be spent more efficiently somewhere else. That is what the budget process is about. 
   Now we are faced with having put together a budget some time back, about 3 or 4 years ago, and finding ourselves being pushed hard to break through the budget caps put in place at that time, largely through emergency spending. It is legitimate when we have emergencies such as we have had this year with weather. 
   We are committed not to go into Social Security money. The President has been saying for 4 years: Save Social Security. But he doesn't have a plan. We have a plan to save Social Security. We are going to do our work towards implementing that plan so the dollars that come in have a place to go so they, indeed, are kept for Social Security. 
   I think the key is the idea of individual accounts, which is what we propose to do. People under a certain age would have an individual account crediting a portion of the money they paid into Social Security. It would be their account, their money, invested in the private sector to return a much higher yield, to ensure that benefits are available. In that way, the money would not be spent for other things, as has been in the past. 
   It also deals with the fact that such changes have taken place. I mentioned we have to look at programs from time to time. When Social Security began, I think there were 150 people working for every beneficiary. It came down to 30. Now there are about three workers for every beneficiary and headed towards two. The choices in that program have become simple: We have to raise taxes, and most people don't want to do that; reduce benefits, and most people don't want to do that; or we can increase the return on revenue, increase the return on the money that is in the account--in this case, your individual account. 
   These are the kinds of things that seem to me to be part of the appropriations process, part of the budgeting process. That is what we are facing. It will be difficult to complete that task, but we are dedicated to doing it. 
   As I indicated, there is a legitimate difference of philosophy. I understand that. We see some of it every day. There are those who believe more spending, more government is better. There are those who believe in the 10th amendment, that more government ought to be closer to the people; that States and communities, and in the case of schools, school districts, have  the best opportunity to make the decisions that affect their children. I believe in that strongly. I think most on this side of the aisle do. 
   There was a long discussion about education today. Education is important to all Members. I think also there was an interesting set of polling done which indicated that for the most part, people do want to make the decisions at the local level, 
   to make the decisions where the kids are, to make the decisions where the families are. 
   There is quite a difference between what needs to be done in Jugwater, WY, or Philadelphia. So the one-size-fits-all kind of program does not fit. We want to have the flexibility to make the changes that are necessary to do that. 
   Unfortunately, our bills will go to the President. The President has, of course, vowed to veto the tax relief bill that we have sent. I do not believe there will be much opportunity to negotiate the basis for that. That is too bad. As we project, there will be excesses. We think they ought to go back to the taxpayers. In fact, the President wants to spend more money, indeed, increase some taxes--for instance, 55 cents on cigarettes that would be there to offset more spending. 
   So these are the kinds of things with which we must deal. We must do that soon. I believe we are headed in the right direction to have the budget that does reflect our needs, that does deal with patients' health care. We passed a bill. We will do that and we will move forward and complete our work by the end of September. 
   Mr. President, I think we have taken nearly all of our time. I yield the remainder of our time and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 2 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill. As a reminder, cloture motions were filed on Friday on S.J. Res. 33 denouncing the offer of clemency to Puerto Rican terrorists and on the Hutchison amendment regarding oil royalties. These cloture votes have been scheduled for 5 p.m. today and may be followed by additional votes on judicial nominations. It is hoped that action on the Interior appropriations bill can be completed by tomorrow and that the Senate can begin consideration of the bankruptcy reform bill. 
   I thank colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as was noted, there are 2 hours of morning business. My associates are going to undertake for the first hour to talk a little bit about the challenges that we face over the next month, 2 months. By the end of this month, of course, we are to have completed the appropriations, and we will be moving forward with that. We will be dealing with the administration and with the President on their completion. We hope that it will not end up in a closing down of Government but, rather, finding some consensus as to how we deal with our budget for next year. 
   We are challenged by different philosophies, of course, as to what that spending ought to be; we are always challenged by a difference of view as to what the priorities are. That is the nature of our body. 
   So, Mr. President, I would like now to yield to my friend, the Senator from Arkansas, for 15 minutes.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Arkansas stated very clearly the strong feeling that I have received from folks in Wyoming. As I went around as well, when I first talked about tax relief, people kind of rolled their eyes. But when you start talking about the specifics of it--estate taxes and marriage penalty taxes--when you talk about the kinds of things that are there to encourage retirement funding and educational funding, you really get a great deal more interest in it. 
   I think the Senator pointed out clearly the real philosophical difference. If the money is here, it will be spent for increased government and increased programs rather than going back to the people who really own the money. 
   I thank the Senator.

As cochairman of the Rural Health Care Caucus, I am particularly interested in those kinds of things. For example, in Wyoming, home health care is so important and sometimes quite expensive, particularly because of the amount of miles that have to be traveled. But for the patient, and because of the cost, home health care is the right way to go. 
   I now yield to the Senator from Missouri to talk a little more about the future and our plans with respect to taxes.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am very pleased my associates could come over this morning and talk about some of the programs that are before us, to talk about some of the directions we will be taking. I think there is another area, in addition to what has been talked about, that is right before us. We are dealing now with spending. We are now in the process of finishing the appropriations process. Congress must adopt 13 different appropriations bills for future spending of the Government and we are in the process of doing that. 
   We also have some budget limitations that we have placed on ourselves, some caps that we have to honor. We are dealing also with emergency spending. We have talked some now about the surpluses that have been available. The surpluses that are available this year, however, are generally Social Security dollars. But there are $14 billion in the regular budget and those will, of course, be available. Most of those have already been set aside as emergency spending. 
   What we have before us is an opportunity to continue to work and complete this matter of funding the budget for this year. At the same time, we must pass it on to the White House. We must find some agreement, either that or have some continuing resolutions that will put us into the future or, in fact, we are faced with the possibility of the President vetoing the legislation and of having the Government shut down, as happened in the past. I hope this will not be the case. 
   I noticed in the paper the other day the President has indicated he would like nothing better than a bipartisan compromise. Hopefully, that is what will happen. Yet he has suggested ``if only the Republicans could be a little more reasonable.'' I am not sure that is necessarily a part of it. Probably his White House aides are happy about this partisan combat because, as we know, the last time the Government was shut down, the Congress shouldered all the responsibility. I do not believe that ought to be the case, and hopefully it will not be this year. We are looking forward to working in those areas. 
   In terms of Social Security, there are some changes that need to be made. We are talking about saving Social Security. We ought to do that. We are committed to doing that. The method of doing it currently, of course, is to put the Social Security surplus in to replace the publicly held debt. The fact is, it then becomes debt that has to be covered by the taxpayers when the time comes to use it. 
   We also are looking at a change in the Social Security Act which responds to what is happening with Social Security. The demographics are changing. When Social Security started, there were 34 people working for every 1 beneficiary. People paid about $30 a year into the program. Now there are three people working for every beneficiary, and it is moving toward two. They are paying 12.5 percent of up to nearly $80,000 into this fund. 
   The fact is, over a period of time, probably in 20 years, there will not be enough money to continue as we have, so we have to make some changes. The choices are very simple ones basically: 
   We can increase taxes. Nobody really wants to do that. The Social Security tax is the largest tax paid by almost all taxpayers in the lower-income brackets. 
   We can reduce benefits. People are not much interested in that. 
   The third alternative, of course, is to increase the revenue that comes from the moneys that are in the trust fund. We are very anxious to do that. It also gives an opportunity to take that money when it comes in and put it somewhere other than into additional national debt loans and put it into individual accounts that people would have as their own, to be invested in the private sector for a much higher yield. 
   These are some of the things with which we grapple. Certainly, we are going to be working with the administration to see if we can do something in that respect. I do not think there is willingness on this side to trade off tax relief for increased spending. I hope not, and I do not believe we will do that. 
   On the other hand, we can find, I am sure, agreement in the appropriations areas, and we can move forward with that. 
   Mr. President, our time has expired. I see there is a Senator on the other side of the isle, so I yield back my time.

   Mr. THOMAS. I will take a very short while. 
   I think the details, the information of this issue have been well discussed. But I rise in strong opposition to what is being proposed based simply on the health of forests. 
   In Wyoming, of course, we have national forests, as they do in Pennsylvania and other places. These forests need to be managed. I just spent several days in August in Yelowstone National Park. We road for 2 days, and all of it was in burnt forests. I have to tell you, that burn was not even effective because the ground fuel is still there. The trees are dead, but the ground fuel is there. 
   So all I am saying is, you have to manage this resource. Something will happen to the trees. They will either die or they will be harvested or they will be diseased. So if we are to have healthy forests, certainly they need to be managed. 
   The proponents of the amendment have said the timber program is wasteful. It was never intended to operate as a commercial tree farm. We have some numbers as to the resources that are provided for communities and the Federal Government. They are substantial. 
   I am not inclined to take a great deal of time. The chief of the Forest Service has stated there are 40 million acres of national forests which are at risk, either through fire or infestation. This amendment would cripple the Forest Service's ability to use the timber harvest to promote health. The amendment will crush a program that provides significant economic contributions to both the Federal Government and the communities. This amendment is wrong. It is shortsighted. I question why the Congress would continue to ask the agency to manage this land and then take away their ability to do that. 
   So I will end by urging Members not to vote for this amendment. 
   I yield back the time.

   Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for giving leadership on this issue. We have worked together for a very long time in this area. I guess I am a little surprised and, frankly, a little offended that it would be said that people on this side of the aisle are not as careful or do not care as much about public lands as someone else. 
   I brought out this map I used yesterday. You can see where the Federal land holdings are in this country. Out in the West, nearly half of the land in most of our States belongs to the Federal Government, and we have taken care of it for years. I think the Senator's State of Illinois has about 2 percent. Here he is telling us how to manage public lands. I find that very difficult. 
   We are very intent on being the stewards of public lands. I want to tell you a little bit about open space. There has been more and more interest in open space as people move out. We have discovered that the best way to keep it is to provide an opportunity for ranchers to continue to operate. That is how you keep open space. We are trying to do that now. We want fair compensation. This has nothing to do with compensation. Let me start by reading the language that we think works. This is what is in the bill:  
   Grazing permits and leases which expire or are transferred, in this or any fiscal year, shall be renewed under the same terms and conditions as contained in the expiring permit or lease until such time as the Secretary completes the process of renewing permits and leases in compliance with all applicable laws.  
   That is what it says, ``all applicable laws,'' which includes the responsibility of the BLM to do this.  
   Nothing in this language shall be deemed to affect the Secretary's statutory authority or the rights of the permittee or lessee.  
   That is the language--the language that we have studied for several years.  We have been through this temporary thing the Senator from Illinois brought forth before, and we are back at it again. We think we have found an answer that would be more long term. 
   Let me cover a few of the things. This year, 5,364 grazing permits are up for renewal; only 2,159 have been renewed. So here we are, almost at the end of September, with people who have leases that, if not studied, will be taken off the land at the end of the month. Section 117 of S. 1292 addresses this problem by allowing the BLM more time to complete the renewal process without causing unwarranted hardship on the rancher or farmer who utilizes the public lands to make a living. Keep in mind, this is not some random thing people do. When the West was settled, we settled in and the homesteads were taken up along the water, the better lands, and these other lands were basically left there. They are simply residual lands that are managed by the BLM. They are very much attached, however, to the water and the other lands to make a ranching economic unit. So it is more than that. 
   Section 117 allows for the renewal of grazing permits under the same terms and conditions of expiring permits pending completion of the renewal process. BLM has to do this, and in the meantime this farmer or rancher is not penalized for something that wasn't his fault. 
   Permits renewed under this provision are not exempt from compliance with existing environmental laws. Permits will be issued under existing environmentally compliant land use plans. That is the way that is. 
   Section 117 allows for a thorough environmental review by the BLM, industry, and the public instead of an abbreviated, cursory environmental analysis, which will probably happen if the Senator has his way. The BLM cannot and will not ignore its environmental obligations due to the threat of litigation, of course. 
   We talked a little bit about the finances of it. One of the interesting things, of course, is that most farmers and ranchers depend on credit. Let me read you something that comes from the Farm Credit Association:  
   It is no secret that providing loans for farmers and ranchers is a risky business. The security offered by section 117 in allowing a full 10-year permit will relieve some of the risks. However, the Senator from Illinois intends to make the practice even more risky by shortening the duration of permits to 1 or 2 years.  
   That is the Farm Credit Association talking about the opportunity to have an effective beef production operation. 
   There is another factor that is underlying all of these things, the Administrative Procedures Act. That allows for these things to continue if the permittee simply sends in a request and does that prior to the time of the exploration. That has been recently dealt with in the court and proved to be an effective tool. The language in this amendment, if it passes, would probably negate that. I think that would be a real problem. 
   So there are a lot of things involved. It sounds kind of simple. You know, we are just going to do it for 2 years and we will get this all resolved. That isn't the way it works, my friends. We have been through this before. We continue to come up each year, and we have found, through the help and leadership of the Senator from New Mexico, a long-term solution that will not change the obligation for environmental protection, will not change the obligation of the BLM, and it, in fact, will take away some of the risk from the farmer or rancher, which has nothing to do with the fact that this has been elongated.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I take this time to talk about the uniqueness of the public lands of the West. It is very clear there are great differences among the States in terms of land management, the kinds of land ownership that exist, and the delivery of health care. 
   Wyoming is a large State. I think we are the eighth largest State in the United States yet the smallest in population. We have small towns. There are twice as many people in Fairfax County as there are in the State of Wyoming. The point I make is ``one size fits all'' in many areas of operation does not work effectively in delivering services. I think that is especially true when we start talking about the management of resources and the management of lands. 
   This chart shows the Federal land holdings by State. The color brown represents almost all New England States with less than 1 percent of their total land surface held by the Federal Government. Blue represents States with 1 percent to 5 percent, including much of the South and the Midwest. Five to 10 percent are the purple-colored States. In the West, the yellow-colored States have up to 65 percent of the State's surface belonging to the Federal Government. It is a unique proposition. Furthermore, there are States in green that go beyond that. This map shows almost 83 percent of Nevada--actually I think it is probably 87 percent of Nevada's surface--belonging to the Federal Government. The same is true in Alaska. 
   There is a great deal of difference in how we do this. The lands belong to everyone. The economy of the States depends on 
   Federal decisions that are made, including the jobs for everyone who lives there. Local county governments take care of all services transpiring on Federal lands. 
   Let me show you an enlarged map of Wyoming. This map gives you an idea of the amount of land in Wyoming belonging to the Federal Government or public lands. This is an Indian reservation. Purple represents national parks. We are very proud of them. The green represents U.S. forest reserves. The interspersed yellow represents land managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Where the railroads went through in the early years are checkerboard lands, with every other section being owned by the Federal Government. There are control and access problems for all of these areas. 
   We depend highly upon the dollars made available through the Interior appropriations. We have had much involvement with the decisions made by the land management agencies in these areas, whether it be BLM or others. I want to emphasize how important it is to talk about some of these important issues. 
   For example, these lands are basic lands. BLM lands were largely residual that remained after the Homestead Act expired. They generally are lands in the plains of our State. The homesteaders came in along the rivers and creeks, taking the most productive lands. The other lands remain managed by the BLM. To remain an agricultural unit it is always necessary to have the productive lands and the other lands for grazing. We use them for multiple use. 
   Everyone in Wyoming wants to use the lands for wildlife, for the preservation of wildlife, hunting, hiking. Indeed, they can be used together. It is sometimes difficult to find agreement. Multiple use, whether for mineral production or not--all the lands yield minerals; mostly oil, trona, soda ash or coal; Wyoming is the largest producer of coal in the country which most people don't realize--is income for the State and the Federal Government with their royalties. 
   We have currently and in this bill we will talk about funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service which manages the Endangered Species Act. This is a very difficult area. Everyone wants to preserve critters, animals, and plants that are endangered. At the same time, there are some questions when we have an animal in some danger. First, the grizzly bears or wolves; now we have the Preble's Meadow jumping mouse listed as endangered. It becomes almost a threat to the private land owners who are restricted from using their lands as they desire because of the potential threat of endangerment. 
   These are the issues we deal with. We deal with PILT payments, payments in lieu of taxes. Fifty percent of the State belongs to the Federal Government. There are no taxes as in private lands. In this bill, there is funding for PILT payments. We will have an amendment to raise it. 
   The counties provide hospital service, the counties provide policing, the counties provide all the services to these lands but have received no revenue as the case would be if they had been private lands. These are the things with which we deal. 
   Much of this supports grazing. Ranchers in Wyoming have permits. They pay so much per animal unit for grazing. We have a problem now because the Forest Service or the BLM has not done a NEPA study for permit renewal. Unfortunately, they have not been able to complete the NEPA studies. Now we are faced with the question: Does the grazing lease expire because there has not been a study? 
   There will be an amendment that says you can go ahead and extend the grazing lease and let the BLM go ahead and make the study; it doesn't preclude the study. The study will still be made, but it allows the grazing to continue because it is no fault of the grazer the study has not been made. 
   The Senator from Arizona talked about forests and forest management. Obviously, in many cases there is some kind of harvesting of mature timber. If it is not harvested and managed in the way you take it out, then it burns. 
   I just came back from spending several days in Yellowstone Park where we had a gigantic fire in the late eighties. It is discouraging to see how long it takes to reforest an area of that kind. 
   We are dealing again in this bill with financing what is called the clean water action plan which has to do with nonpoint source water controls. One hundred eleven ideas, put forth by EPA to do some things like that, frankly, are going to be extremely difficult and will have much to do with the utilization and multiple use of these lands because you have to have the water to do that.  
   We talk about droughts in the East. Frankly, this kind of area does not get as much rainfall in a normal year as we did in a drought. This is 14 inches per year. The water, the runoff, and the irrigation are a very real part of it. 
   We are going to move into this area this afternoon. I am very pleased with what has been done. The Senator from Washington has put together a bill which I think has great merit. We are trying to do some things that will make it more workable in terms of oil royalties, grazing fees, and some of the other things that do become controversial. 
   I urge people to take a look at the situation, even though they do not live here, and try to understand why some of these things need to be handled a little bit differently because of the situation we have in the West. 
   I thank the Chair for the opportunity to talk about this bill. I believe we have used our time, or very close to it. I yield back the time if we have not.

   Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I have been on and off the floor all day. We have been at this for about 6 hours. I suspect most everything has been said, but we all, of course, haven't said it. 
   I rise in support of what we are attempting--for the idea that we can do the things that are essential for the Federal Government to do and at the same time return substantial amounts of money to the people who own money, the taxpayers.  
   I have been amazed at all the discussion that has gone on. We are talking about a fairly simple thing--tax relief. Yet I hear from the other side of the aisle how damaging that is to the economy. That is hard to imagine, isn't it, that returning money to people who have paid it in is going to damage the economy. 
   We have tax relief based on our best estimate, provided by those who do professional estimating, that we will have a $3 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. Will it happen? Who knows. No one can guarantee it. But that is the way you have to plan any enterprise, by the best estimates you can make. We find ourselves now, of course, paying the highest taxes as a percentage of gross national product of any time since World War II. Surprising, isn't it, in this large of an economy. It certainly means one thing; that is, that the Government continues to grow. 
   I think it is interesting to see the polls. When they ask, what is your highest priority? Do you like Social Security? Do 
   you like Medicare? Do you like tax reduction? Tax reduction generally is the third one. That is not the point. We are setting aside Social Security before we do tax reduction. We are sustaining enough money to take care of Medicare. So that is not the choice. 
   The better poll would be: What do you do after you have taken care of Social Security? What do you do when you have taken care of Medicare? Should you return the money? I think so. 
   I saw somebody use an example of the simplest way to look at it, suggesting that you have three dollar bills in your hands, each representing $1 trillion. You say: I am going to set aside two of these dollars to do something with Social Security because that is where the surplus comes from. I am going to spend part of the third one for Medicare and the other costs that will be there. And about two-thirds of the last one we are going to give back to the people who sent it in because it is an overpayment of taxes. It is a fairly simple thing. 
   We have, of course, in this case, as we do in many, a pretty strong difference of philosophy. We have on that side of the aisle people who prefer more government, more spending, more taxes. That is the philosophy. I understand that. I don't happen to agree with it. 
   Our party, on the other hand, is one that says we ought to slim down the Federal Government; we ought to move more and more government towards the States and the counties, leave more and more money in the hands of the people. That is the philosophy, a difference of philosophy. That is so often the basis of our disagreement on many things. I understand that. It is perfectly legitimate. But if you want more government, that is fine. If you want the Government to spend more money, that is fine. That is a philosophy, one that has, through the years, been on that side of the aisle. It is not really a surprise. 
   People say, of course, how is it going to affect me? Well, it affects us in very real ways: 
   Estate taxes: I have a lot of people who farm and ranch in Wyoming who are very concerned about that. Capital gains taxes: More and more people are investing their money. The capital gains tax needs to be changed. Insurance deductions for health insurance, that people pay their own premiums, to be deducted, that is a reasonable thing to do. The marriage penalty, we have talked about that--a very reasonable thing to do. 
   So we often get lost in the details when we say, as taxpayers, what does this do for us? I think it does a great deal for us. I think we should move forward. I am sorry we don't have agreement with the gentleman at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, but that ought not to keep us from doing what we think is right, and that is the thing we ought to do. 
   I urge that my associates do the right thing.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to endorse the comments of my associates who have spoken in the last few minutes. This is an interesting program. We have been through this before. We went through it in 1996. There were extensive changes made in the farm bill in 1996 that resulted in a number of changes. We have a program that has provided consumers with low, stable prices. It operates at no direct cost to the taxpayers. It helps reduce the Federal deficit and creates 420,000 jobs. 
   The Senator from California was talking about the closing of one plant. I am talking about growers, family farmers in Wyoming. I don't recognize the description by the Senator from Arizona of the people who are involved. That is not the way we do it. 
   A number of things have changed that I think are very important. It was mentioned, when we didn't have a sugar program, the average cost of raw sugar was up to nearly 70 cents. It is now somewhere in the neighborhood of 20. Sugar policy benefits consumers. In developed countries, the average price is 60 cents; the highest is 92. The U.S. price is 41. We are 32 percent below the average consumer price for sugar. 
   It has been pointed out that at the same time raw sugar prices have gone down almost 6 percent, the cost of products such as cereal have gone up 18 percent; ice cream, 18 percent; candy, 20 percent; cookies and cakes, up 25 percent. That is not the reason the cost of goods has gone up. 
   Under the farm bill, there is no minimum price guarantee. They have no recourse loans other than when there is an exception to the imports. Sugar farmers receive no Government payment and have not since the 1970s. Indeed, they do pay a marketing assessment that goes to reduce the deficit, an unusual characteristic. 
   This business of the ``world price'' that has been discussed is clearly a dump price. The average production cost is 18 cents; the average world price is 9 cents. Figure out if that is really the market working. Of course it isn't. It is a dumped price. 
   The farm bill is not the time to discuss the sugar bill. It was extended in 1996 in the farm bill, to be reviewed again in the year 2002. The sugar industry is very happy to reduce the import quotas if the rest of the world does the same thing. 
   We are talking about small producers, not huge money conglomerates. I am a little offended at the idea that soft money is the reason that people support this program. This is a program that has served us well. The time when we are talking about strengthening agriculture is not the time to do this. 
   I urge my associates in the Senate to reject this amendment. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this is the last week before we go on recess. We will be gone approximately a month. We will have an opportunity to be home, to talk to our constituents about the issues that are here, to talk about what we have done during this calendar year, and talk about what we have not done for this year as well. We will be back, then, the first part of September. We will have, probably, 2 months to continue and to complete our work for this year. 
   There are 13 appropriations bills that must be passed to keep the Government running. They must be passed by September 30, the end of the fiscal year. This is a very difficult task. We are, hopefully, running on time. We passed eight bills out of the Senate. However, none has yet been sent to the President. So we will have a couple of months to wind up the year's work. I cannot tell you how important it is that we do complete that work. Of course, the Presiding Officer is the key Senator in that regard. He has done a great job. 
   We do not want the President to be able to put us in a position again of closing down the Government and blaming the Congress. I hope what we do is get these bills to him. I think we will do that. I cannot help but mention as we think about this a little bit, I hope in Congress we take a look at a biennial budget, as we have in many States--for instance, my home State of Wyoming. The Congress or the legislature would form a budget for a 2-year period of time, which has advantages, particularly for the agencies, and we would have the other year for oversight, which is equally as important a task for the Congress--to oversee the expenditure of those dollars. So I hope we are able to do that. 
   This has been a tough year. We have had lots of difficulties, starting, of course, with the impeachment process, which was difficult. I don't know that it slowed us up particularly. On the contrary, we did a lot of committee work during the time the impeachment was going on. Nevertheless, it was tough. Then came the Colorado Columbine situation, of course, the tragedy out there at the school and, with that, the great controversy over gun control, which we are likely to see again now after the tragedy in Georgia. Then Kosovo was also an issue, of course, although Congress really was not as involved. It was pretty much the President on his own, committing troops there. Obviously, we were going to support them. 
   So it has been a difficult year. Despite that, it seems to me we have accomplished a great deal. I am a little disappointed that most of the accomplishments have been made without the support of the minority. Our friends on the other side have, in fact, opposed nearly everything that has been done--I think, unfortunately, often more to create an issue than to create a solution. That often is the choice we have; you can cook up something you can take home to talk about in political rhetoric, as opposed to trying to find some solutions. 
   But we have accomplished a great deal. Much of the controversy will continue, I suppose. There are legitimate differences of view when we are on the floor on almost every issue. Generally, the issue is the larger issue of whether or not you want more and more Federal Government, more and more Federal regulation, more and more taxes--which is basically Senators on that side of the aisle as opposed to this side of the 
   aisle, where we are looking for limited government, where we are looking for less regulation, where we are looking for an opportunity for people to spend more of their own money. 
   So basically, when you get down to it in almost all these issues, if you really pare it away, that is the debate. Legitimate? Yes, indeed, it is legitimate. I happen to be on the side of being more conservative, of thinking we ought to be moving more and more of these decisions back to the States and to the counties rather than deciding everything, one-size-fits-all, at the Federal level. But these are the differences, and they are the basis for most of the things we find in conflict. We have had less cooperation from the administration than I had hoped we would have, from that side of the aisle. I think the President is seeking to change his image so the politics become more important than the movement of the congressional budget. 
   Let's review some of the highlights. The most recent one, of course, is the passage of tax relief, something I think is very legitimate, perfectly logical. We went through great debates about it, of course. One of the keys, naturally, is that you have to talk about reduction of taxes after having done something to save Social Security, having done something to strengthen Medicare. That is part of the program. That is not the choice. 
   We see these polls that are run from time to time. They say: Would you rather have Social Security protected or would you rather have tax relief? That is not the issue. That is one of the things we worked at. All of us are setting aside this surplus that comes from Social Security for the preservation of Social Security. These funds which will be used to reduce taxes and give some tax relief are beyond that. 
   I think one of the best illustrations is the Member who had three dollars--three dollar bills. This is basically the surplus we are looking at in the next 10 years, $3 trillion, each of these. Two of them are being set aside for Social Security. Tax relief constitutes about 75 percent of the third one, with the additional amount of the third one being set aside for spending and for Medicare. The press has not been very helpful, of course, trying to get that understanding. But in any event, I think that is a real movement forward. 
   The thing one also has to keep in mind is, if there is money lying around here, it is going to be spent. It is going to be spent enlarging Federal Government. So if you go back to that original thesis, you go back to the original notion that you would like to move activities back closer to people, you do it that way rather than bringing more and more money here that inevitably will be spent increasing the size of Government. 
   I think we have some hope there. Both Houses have passed some tax relief. We will see if we can find a way to put that together, hopefully this week. Then it will be up to the President to say whether he wants to spend more and more money, wants to spend $1 trillion on 81 new programs, or let the American people have an opportunity to spend some of their own. 
   Education? Our position again has been that the decisions that are basic to elementary and secondary education ought to be made closest to the people. They ought to be made by the States and by the school boards. Sure, we have an obligation to provide some financial help, but the Ed-Flex program that was passed by this Senate allows those decisions to be made more at home. 
   I can tell you, the delivery of education is quite 
   different in Wyoming or different in Alaska, the State of the Presiding Officer, from what it is in New York--and properly so. But to make that work, then, the local people have to have that opportunity. We have done that with Ed-Flex, and we had some other educational programs.  
   I feel fairly strongly about some of the Federal involvement. My wife is a teacher. She teaches special ed and spends almost half of her time on paperwork because of the kinds of Federal programs that are involved. So we are making some movement to change that. 
   The military fulfills what is obviously one of the principal, if not the principal, obligations of the Federal Government, to provide for the safety and protection and defense of this country. Over the last number of years, the administration has increasingly reduced the amount of resources there. At the same time, we had more demands on the military than we had before. They are not able to conduct their mission on the amount of resources that have been available. I was very disappointed it took a congressional committee to press and push and demand from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to really get down to whether they are able to carry out their mission with the resources they have. The answer was no. So we have moved to make some additions to that, in the first step for a very long time. 
   The other thing is, if you are going to have a voluntary force, you have to make it fairly attractive to be in the military, and after having trained people to do technical things like flying airplanes or servicing airplanes, they have to stay in the service and do that. So we need more of that kind of support. 
   Social Security? For a very long time no one would talk about Social Security. It is the third rail of politics--touch it and you are dead. Now, finally, everyone does understand that you have to do something different if, indeed, your purpose is to maintain the benefits that are now going to beneficiaries and to provide an opportunity for young people, who are beginning to work and put their money into the fund, to have some anticipation of having benefits for themselves. 
   We have to make some changes. The sooner those changes are made the less severe they will have to be. 
   The President has been talking about saving Social Security for several years. He has no plan. He has done nothing except talk about it. We now have a plan. There is a bipartisan plan on this floor. There has been a lockbox amendment to preserve Social Security funds. It has been opposed on the other side of the aisle five times, but we are going to move forward on Social Security. 
   VA funding: The administration has for several years requested a flat budget for VA health care but at the same time has expanded the eligibility for people to utilize those facilities. We find, for instance, in my State we have two facilities, but they are underfinanced and are not providing the kinds of services to which veterans are entitled. More money needs to be provided, and we are going to do that. The Republican budget this year had an additional $1.7 billion for veterans' health. It is something that is very important. 
   Patients' Bill of Rights: We passed a Patients' Bill of Rights that did not involve the Federal Government, did not involve lawyers and the courts making the decisions but indeed guaranteed emergency services without having to go through some kind of clearance. It guaranteed, if you felt as if you were not getting the services, an appeal to a physician, not to a lawyer or to a court, and that was passed. 
   Medicare: We moved to doing something with Medicare. A bipartisan commission was set up and they have a reasonable plan for Medicare, but the President asked his folks whom he appointed to serve on that commission to vote against it, so it did not come out as a commission report and as a commission recommendation. We are going to take that, basically, and move forward and do something on Medicare. 
   We are moving toward the end. We have some very difficult issues to deal with, particularly in appropriations. We have to deal with them. We will deal with them. I am hopeful we will also have some kind of a relief valve so that if we get through and cannot come to an agreement with the President that it goes on as it has and will not let that political technique be used again. I hope we find a little less resistance from our friends on the other side in terms of finding solutions to these problems. 
   I also hope--and this is a philosophy, I admit--that as we go forward we continue to understand the greatness of this country. And it is a great country. If you have had a chance to travel about a bit, you find it is the greatest. Each time I have a chance to go somewhere, I come back thanking God this is the place in which I live. But it is a great country not because of the Federal Government. There is a legitimate role for the Federal Government, of course, described, by the way, in the Constitution, but the real strength of this country lies in its communities and in its individuals who have the freedom to make decisions for themselves. They have the freedom to get together and do things that are required to be done in their communities to make them healthy. 
   Admittedly, I come from a State that is unique. Maybe we are the lowest populated State now. We are one of the largest States. The delivery of services is quite different, whether it be airlines, whether it be electricity, whether it be education. We cannot have this one-size-fits-all situation. 
   Again, I am pleased with what we have done. I say to the Presiding Officer that he has had one of the most difficult tasks of leadership in the Appropriations Committee and has done a good job. 
   I hope we will continue to provide an opportunity for us to come together to resolve our problems so that we can continue to have the opportunity to serve, to let communities make some of their decisions, and we will continue to be the greatest country in the world. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to visit a little bit a topic that will be coming before the Senate very soon, probably tomorrow, and that is tax relief and the reconciliation bill we will be considering.  
   To me that is one of the most important things before us, not only as the Senate but before us as American people. We ought to spend our time focusing on that issue. 
   I have been a little amazed at the comments that have been made this morning. I only heard part of them, but they said this tax relief will certainly damage the economy. I have never heard of anything like that in my entire life. More money in the hands of Americans will probably strengthen the economy. We heard about Alan Greenspan's comments. The fact is, his complete comments were that he would much rather see tax relief than expending those dollars in larger government, which basically is the alternative. 
   We ought to review again for ourselves and for listeners where we are with respect to the surplus, where we are with respect to the public debt, and with the President's proposal versus tax relief. 
   We all know we worked a very long time to have a balanced budget. For the first time in 25 years, we have a balanced budget, and we want to be sure the majority of the surplus is Social Security money. This is the first time we have done this in a very long time. It is largely the result, of course, of a strong economy and some efforts on the part of this Congress to have a balanced budget amendment, to have some spending caps to hold down spending. 
   What can we expect? According to the Congressional Budget 
   Office which released their midsession review on July 21, the estimates are that the total budget surplus will measure $1.1 trillion to the year 2004, and to the year 2009 nearly $3 trillion in surplus will be coming in. The non-Social Security portion of that surplus will measure almost $300 billion to the year 2004 and nearly $1 trillion to the year 2009. This is the non-Social Security surplus that comes in to our budget. 
   The congressional budget resolution which talks about tax relief will leave the publicly held debt level at $1.6 trillion. The President's, on the other hand, will leave it at $1.8 trillion. With some tax relief, the reduction in publicly held debt under the tax relief program, the reconciliation program we will be talking about the next several days, will reduce the debt more than the President's plan which plans to spend the money. 
   These are the facts. It is interesting; the budget chairman was on the floor yesterday indicating that out of the total amount of money that will be in the surplus, less than 25 percent will be used for tax relief and it will still be $1 trillion. 
   These are the facts, and it seems to me we ought to give them some consideration. 
   Another fact that I believe is important in this time of prosperity, in this time of having a balanced budget and having a surplus, is the American people are paying the highest percentage of gross national product in taxes ever, higher than they did in World War II. Certainly, there is a case to be made for some sort of tax relief. If there are surplus dollars, these dollars ought to go back to the people who paid them. They ought to go back to the American people to spend as they choose. 
   There will be great debates about this, and there have been great debates about this. There are threats by the White House to veto any substaintial tax reductions. Sometimes one begins to wonder, as we address these issues, whether or not it should be what we think is right or whether we have to adjust it to avoid a veto. That is a tough decision. Sometimes we ought to say: All right, if we believe in something, we ought to do what we think is right. If the President chooses to veto it, let him veto it. Otherwise, we compromise less than we think we should. Those are the choices that have to be made. 
   We will enter into this discussion again, as we have in the past, with different philosophies among the Members of this body. Of course, it is perfectly legitimate. The basic philosophy of our friends on the other side is more government and more spending. The basic philosophy of Republicans has been to hold down the size of government and have less government spending. 
   There is more to tax reduction than simply tax relief. It has to do with controlling the size of the Federal Government. If we have surplus money in the budget, you can bet your bottom dollar we are going to have more government and more spending, and to me there is a relationship. 
   Of course, we need to utilize those funds to fulfill what are the legitimate functions of the Federal Government. It is also true that there is a different view of what are the legitimate functions of the Federal Government. I personally believe the Federal Government ought to be as lean as we can keep it. Constitutionally, it says the Federal Government does 
   certain things and all the rest of the things not outlined in the Constitution are left to the States and to the people. I think that is right. I believe the State, the government closest to the people, is the one that can, in fact, provide the kinds of services that are most needed and that fit the needs of the people who live there. 
   I come from a small State. I come from a State of low population. The delivery of almost all the services--whether it be health care, whether it be education, whether it be highways--is different in Wyoming than it is in New York and, indeed, it should be. Therefore, the one-size-fits-all things we tend to do at the Federal Government are not applicable, are not appropriate, and we ought to move as many of those decisions as we can to the States so they can be made closest to the people. 
   We will see that difference of philosophy. There are legitimate arguments. That is exactly why we are here, to talk about which approach best fits the needs of the American people: whether we want more Federal Government, whether we want more spending, whether we want to enable more growth in the Federal Government, having the Government involved in more regulatory functions or, indeed, whether we want to limit the Government to what we believe are the essential elements with which the Federal Government ought to concern itself, or whether we ought to move to encourage and strengthen the States to do that. 
   We have on this side of the aisle, of course, our goals, our agenda. They include preserving Social Security. I am one of the sponsors of our Social Security bill which we believe will provide, over time, the same kinds of benefits for young people who are just beginning to pay and will maintain the benefits for those who are now drawing them. We can do that. 
   We have tried now I think five times to bring to this floor a lockbox amendment to make sure Social Security money is kept aside and is used for that purpose. We hope it will end up with individual accounts where people will have some of their Social Security money put into their own account where they can choose to have it in equities, or they can choose to have it in bonds, or they can choose to have it in a combination of the two. Increased earnings will accrue to their benefit, and, indeed, they will own it. If they are unfortunate enough to pass away before they use it, it becomes part of their estate. 
   Those are the things that are priorities for us. We want to do something with education. We sought to do that this year, to provide Federal funding of education to the States in the forms of grants so those decisions can be made to fit Cody, WY, as well as they do Long Island, NY, but quite differently. 
   We have done some military strengthening. We have done that this year. We want to continue to do that. We have not been able to increase the capacity of the military for a number of years. We need to do that. This is not a peaceful world, as my friends talked about. 
   Those are the choices. We will hear: If you are going to have tax relief, you cannot do these things. That is not true. We will have a considerable amount left over after we do a Social Security set-aside, after we do tax relief, and there will be adequate dollars to do Medicare reform and to do military reform. 
   That is the plan, that is the program, and that is, I believe, what we should be orienting ourselves toward. 
   I hope that over the next several days we will have the opportunity to fully debate this. I think there will be great differences in how you do tax relief. There are a million ways to do it. Frankly, I hope we not only have tax relief but also that we help simplify  the tax system rather than make it even more complicated than it is. Therefore, I think those will be the issues we should really address. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
   I wanted to talk about this issue because I feel very strongly about it. I have not been able to hear everything this morning, but it seems we have turned this into a little fairness technique which I have a little trouble understanding. 
   What we are talking about is whether or not you put authorizing legislation on appropriations bills. It seems to have been turned into kind of a contest of who is being treated fairly. I don't quite understand that, frankly. 
   There has been a lot of talk about the House. I served in the House. This is a different place. We have different rules--no question about that. We should have, and we will continue to have different rules. 
   Since I have been here, I think this leader has been very fair in operating to give everyone a chance to speak, as should be the case. On the other side of the coin, we haven't heard much about the fact that these appropriations bills are amended with things that have nothing to do with them, and we lose track of where we are going on these appropriations bills. 
   I think there is some responsibility on the part of the minority to feel that we need to accomplish something in this place other than simply introducing amendments that have nothing to do with the bill that is being considered. As you can see, I feel fairly strongly about that. 
   One of the things which I think is important is to separate the idea of authorizing committees from appropriations. That is why we have an Energy Committee; that is why we have an Armed Services Committee; that is why we have an Agriculture Committee--to talk about the policy in those particular areas, and to determine what the authorizations are going to be and what the role of Government is going to be. Then we follow with the appropriations bills, which also, by the way, have a great deal of power because, obviously, you can't do a great deal in terms of policy unless there are some funds with which to do it. 
   But when you do it the other way, as the minority apparently is urging, then  you avoid hearings and you avoid having any real discussion in committees on the issue. They apparently want to just come to the floor with the issue having had no background at all. I am afraid I don't understand that. It seems to me to be a little naive to suggest that we have rules of that type. 
   I wanted to talk a little bit about it.

   Mr. THOMAS. No. I will continue a little bit, and then I will be happy to answer the question when I am finished. 
   I think we ought to emphasize this idea of authorizations. I was happy to be on the appropriations committee when I was in the Wyoming State legislature. So I have had some experience with that. 
   The idea that you just simply ignore the authorizing 
   committees and begin to do everything on appropriations is wrong, absolutely wrong. 
   How we got here I am not sure. The minority whip has been here longer than I and I suspect remembers when Democrats were in charge. But I think maybe he has forgotten a little bit about the way it operated then. As I understand it, when the Senator from Maine was in charge, it operated very much the same way. I am not suggesting that should be the case, nor am I suggesting it is. It seems to me that there have been real efforts to be as fair as we can be, and that should be. We need to do that. 
   In addition to having the opportunity to put everything on the floor, which I agree with, there is also a responsibility on the part of all of us to accomplish some things. 
   My recollection is that during the last number of months amendments that have come from the other side of the aisle have generally been to stop anything from happening. There are a good deal of examples of that. Frankly, that is very frustrating for me--to bring up something and then the bill has to be withdrawn from the floor because we have lost completely the direction of things. 
   What is this debate about? It is very simple. It simply says that in the precedence of the Senate, unless an amendment has to do with the same subject as does the appropriations bill, it is not allowed on the bill. You can make a point of order. And there has to be a majority vote to follow it up. That is pretty simple. I think it is fairly reasonable. If you are going to come in through the appropriations bill and put an appropriations amendment on it, you can have a point of order, have a vote on it, and, if it isn't appropriate, it isn't used. I don't find much of a problem with that. 
   I think we ought to get to the topic and talk about what it is we are doing rather than going through all of these gyrations of fairness, and so on, in terms of getting on the floor. If that is a problem, if that is a real problem, then we have to resolve that problem. This is not the way to resolve that problem. 
   We have some things that we have to do. We have to accomplish things right now. What do we have, 13 appropriations bills with which we have to deal? I think we have dealt with about seven. There are a number of examples of how nongermane issues have been raised and have been withdrawn. We have to withdraw the topic from the appropriations bill. 
   What we are doing is seeking to overturn the ruling of the Chair with respect to legislation on appropriations bills. 
   If the minority whip would like to make a comment, or ask a question, I would be more than happy to respond.

   Mr. THOMAS. I can answer that very quickly. Yes, I agree with that. I think it is the same concept as coming to the floor with an amendment on an issue that has never been discussed, has never been authorized. To do that in the conference committee, I believe, is equally wrong.

   Mr. THOMAS. I do think so. I do think it is the same concept there. What we want to avoid, in many ways, is putting more authority into this Appropriations Committee. It is a very important committee. I recognize that. But it ought not be the center of all of our activity, and it can be if we are not careful. So I think there is a balance in both these areas. I support both the propositions that are here, and I hope we have some action that will put them into place.

   Mr. THOMAS. I understand that. I think it was five, but 
   as a sponsor of the lockbox, I am very much for it. But in this instance it just seems to me that is what I am talking about, simply blocking it. There has been much opportunity to talk about lockbox. You can talk about it whenever you choose. 
   I guess the reason the Senator voted against cloture is because he wanted an opportunity to amend.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs of the Foreign Relations Committee, I rise in strong opposition to the motion to discharge S.J. Res. 27. My objections to the motion and the underlying resolution, and to bringing them up at this point in time, are both procedural and substantive. 
   My first procedural objection is that while the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. SMITH] is within his rights to move to discharge the joint resolution pursuant to 19 U.S.C. &#167;2192(c) and 2193, by doing so he is effectively seeking to bring it to the floor by completely circumventing the committee process. S.J. Res. 27 was referred to the Finance Committee on June 7 of this year. As my friend the distinguished chairman of that committee [Mr. ROTH] has noted today, the committee has had no opportunity to hold hearings on the relative merits of the resolution, to amend it, or to prepare a report on it to the full Senate. A piece of legislation this important, that would--if passed--have a huge effect on what I believe will be our most important bilateral relationship in the next century, deserves to be considered fully by the committee of jurisdiction without having that process short-circuited by a single Senator--especially one that is not a member of the committee in question. 
   Second, the Senate still has a number of vitally important appropriations bills to complete before Congress recesses for August. There is no connection whatsoever between these legislative matters and the joint resolution. There exists no time exigency which makes it important to lay aside debate on appropriations bills in order to debate China NTR nor, for that matter, which makes it important to circumvent the statutory process set out for the consideration of resolutions like S.J. Res. 27. 
   And that brings up my third procedural objection. Pursuant to the Trade Act of 1974, it is the practice of the Senate that a resolution of disapproval of a renewal of NTR status must originate in the House. Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. &#167;2192(f)(1)(A)(ii) and 2192(f)(1)(B), any resolution of disapproval which passes the Senate before receipt from the House of a similar or identical joint resolution is required to be held at the desk until the House acts and passes such a joint resolution. H.J. Res. 57, the companion resolution to S.J. Res. 27, was introduced in the House on June 7, 1999, and referred to the Committee on Ways and Means. On July 1, the committee considered the resolution, and ordered it to be reported adversely by voice vote. The full House has yet to act on that report. So even if for some reason which escapes me the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. SMITH] can justify his urgent desire to bring his legislation to the floor, where is the logic in putting the procedural cart before the horse and acting before the House does? 
   Those are my procedural objections to the motion. But I also oppose the resolution, and thus the motion to discharge it, on substantive grounds. In my five years as subcommittee chairman, I have always fully supported unconditional NTR status for China and done so for several reasons: some practical, some policy-based. 
   First, from a practicality standpoint, I firmly believe revoking NTR would hurt us more than the Chinese--the economic equivalent of cutting off your nose to spite your face, or, as the Chinese say, ``lifting up a rock only to drop it on your foot.'' In 1998, U.S. exports to China directly supported over 200,000 U.S. jobs. In 1995, China bought $1.2 billion worth of civilian aircraft, $700 million of telecommunications equipment, $330 million of specialized machinery, and $270 million of heating and cooling equipment. Those figures have grown since then. 
   China is now the world's third largest economy, and will continue to grow at an impressive pace well into the next century. The World Bank estimates that China will need almost $750 billion 
   in new investments to fund industrial infrastructure projects alone in the next decade. Cutting off NTR--and the Chinese retaliation that would surely follow--would only serve to deprive us of a growing market. China is perfectly capable of shopping elsewhere and our ``allies'' are more than happy to step into any void we leave. We recently saw a prime example of that willingness; in 1996 then-Premier Li Peng traveled to France where he signed a $2 billion contract to buy 33 Airbuses--a contract that Boeing thought it was going to get. 
   Second, instead of using the NTR issue as a carrot-and-stick with the PRC, I believe the best way to influence the growth of democratic ideals, human rights, and the rule of law in that country is through continued economic contacts. I think anybody who has been to China, especially over the course of the last 15 years, has seen that for themselves. One of the strongest impressions that I take away from every trip I make to China in my capacity as subcommittee chairman is the dramatic effect that economic reform has had on the population. As you  travel south from Beijing to Guangzhou where the greatest economic development has taken place, it is clear that economic development and contact with the West through trade has let a genie out of the bottle that the regime in Beijing will never be able to put back. 
   Local government officials do not want to talk about the Taiwan dispute; they want to talk trade. Local businessmen do not want to talk about political ideology; that want to talk about increasing their profits and establishing a legal framework in China within which to do business. Local citizens do not care about the latest pronouncements from the Central Committee; they care about increasing their incomes and bettering their living conditions. People of the hundreds of thousands of villages where local democratic elections have been held have made it clear they would not quietly return to the old way of doing things. 
   The development of a market economy is the best way to encourage democratic reform. We have seen it in South Korea, we have seen it in Taiwan, we have seen it in the former Soviet Union, and I believe that we are beginning to see it now in China. 
   Third, revoking NTR would have a damaging effect on the economies of Hong Kong and Taiwan--two of our closest friends in the region. A vast majority of our China trade passes through Hong Kong and Taiwan; in addition, revoking NTR would have the greatest impact in the southern China provinces of Guangdong and Fujian where Hong Kong and Taiwanese businessmen have made substantial investments. Just for the limited sanctions and countersanctions proposed during our dispute over Chinese infringement of our intellectual property rights in 1996, the Hong Kong government estimated that Hong Kong would loose 11,500 jobs, $13.4 billion in reexport trade, and 0.4 of a percentage point from a 4.6% GDP. The effects would be much more pronounced were NTR to be involved. 
   Fourth, NTR is not some special treatment or favor that the United States passes out rarely; it is the normal tariff status with our trading partners. Only 8 countries are not accorded that status: Afghanistan, Zerbaijan, Cambodia, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, Vietnam, and Serbia. To cast China into that grouping of pariah states would do irreparable damage to our bilateral relationship, and to the security and stability of East Asia as a whole. 
   With the demise of the cold war, and changing world realities, we would do better to repeal Jackson-Vanik and the yearly theater that surrounds the China NTR debate. It only serves: to make U.S. businesses nervous--they never know from one year to the next whether they will have NTR, and their investments in China, yanked out from underneath them; to complicate our relationship with the Chinese--the annual debate always reminds them that we treat them differently than almost every other country and some of the ensuing rhetoric in the debates is less than helpful to the relationship; and, to compromise our credibility both with the Chinese and in Asia in general--threats to revoke NTR have yet to be carried out and conditioning has never worked. 
   I am not an apologist for the PRC--far from it. My subcommittee has held numerous hearings highlighting Chinese human rights abuses, oppression in Tibet, saber rattling aimed at Taiwan, unfair trade practices including tariff and non-tariff barriers, and the recent allegations of espionage--all issues I have raised personally with Chinese leaders from President Jiang on down. But no matter how maddening or ill-advised Beijing's behavior, I do not believe that withholding NTR is an effective instrument of foreign policy vis-a-vis China. In fact, I believe that there is no more effective way to influence the PRC than engaging China and slowly drawing it into the family of nations. If there is a way, I have yet to be made aware of it; I just know that the revocation or conditioning of NTR is not it. 
   For all these reasons then, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to discharge S. J. Res. 27. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to talk about a bill introduced on Friday on Social Security in which I and other sponsors were involved. I mention it because it seems to me that it is one of the issues that is most important. I just came back from Wyoming, and I talked with folks about issues. Social Security is one of those that is, of course, a top priority. 
   Obviously, most everyone knows Social Security has to be changed if we are to fulfill the goals all of us want, and that is to protect Social Security for those who are now beneficiaries, to keep it going for those who are now paying in and will pay in for many years and can then expect to be beneficiaries. Those are the things that have to happen, and there have to be changes to cause that to happen. 
   We have a rapidly aging population. When we started Social Security, there were some 30 people working for every one who was drawing benefits. An individual paid $30 a year into Social Security in the 1930s. Then we got to where there were five people working for every one who was a beneficiary. Now I believe it is less than three, and we will soon be to the point where there will be one individual working for every one person drawing benefits. We have to make changes. Of course, people are living longer, so that also brings new demands on the programs. 
   What are the options? There are several that are fairly obvious, some of which are not particularly popular. A tax increase: We already pay 12.5 percent of what we make into Social Security. That is a rather high percentage. For many people that is the largest tax they pay. So tax increases are 
   not particularly a good option. 
   We could cut benefits. I do not think people generally want to cut benefits. There may be some changes made in benefits because people are living longer and there are changes in our lives. 
   The third alternative is one which I think probably has the most appeal, and that is to get a higher rate of return on the money we are putting into Social Security and have been putting into it for some time. That is the part of the bill we have introduced. 
   It is a bicameral, bipartisan bill that enhances the program through private accounts. It will take a portion of the money you and I put into Social Security--I believe it is about 2 percent of the 12.5 percent--and that becomes a personal account for each person. It can be invested then at the direction of that account owner. It can be invested in equities, stocks, it can be invested in bonds, or it can be invested in a combination of those things. It will be invested by a private investor such as the Federal employees program is now. You will have a broad choice. The owners will not be doing the investing, but they will be choosing the kinds of investment they want. 
   This can then accumulate as a nest egg for the owner. If the owner is unfortunate not to live long enough to receive the benefits that will accrue to his or her estate, it will be the owner's. 
   We have been talking a lot about a safety box, some way to take the money that comes in to Social Security and ensure it is used for that purpose and not spent for some other purpose or not loaned to the general fund. This probably and certainly is the best way to do that. 
   I make the point that we are not looking at total privatization. Some people accuse us of that. That is not the case. It is a partial privatization. It puts money in so it can earn more than it has earned in the past. As most people understand, excess in the trust funds now has to be invested in Government securities. It has a relatively lower return, lower than if you and I invested those securities. This is a change for improvement. 
   We need to work on the lockbox. We tried five times to pass the lockbox legislation to have some way to ensure Social Security funds coming in are not expended for other things, and that they are, indeed, kept for the purpose of maintaining and strengthening Social Security. That is what we want to do. 
   There are some other good features of the plan. It is more progressive. It guarantees larger benefits for low-income workers. It increases widow benefits, which has been unfair in the past. It repeals earnings limitations, if you are a beneficiary and choose to continue to work. In, in fact, there are several incentives for continuing to work. Since people are living longer and are healthier, there is more reason and opportunity and willingness to work. 
   This bill is designed to protect current retirees. Current beneficiaries will not be affected by the changes. It is aimed primarily at young people who are beginning to pay into the program. Almost all young people 20 years old say: We probably won't get anything out of this; all we will do is pay. That is very unfair, and we can change that. 
   There is a great deal of talk about doing something with Social Security, but, frankly, the administration and our 
   friends on the other side generally have not come up with a plan. Now we have a bipartisan plan which is before the Senate. We can do something that will make the changes we propose to make and which are good for the American people. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I won't even take 5 minutes. I want to share some of the frustration I have about where we are, trying to move forward with what I think is one of the most important issues before us and, of course, that is Social Security. Everybody is talking about it, of course, and they say, oh, yes, we want to do something. When the time comes, how many times have we been frustrated in trying to get to what is essentially the first step to do something about Social Security? That, of course, is to have a lockbox, take the money coming in for Social Security and put it there so that we can do something with Social Security. 
   So this is clearly the first step that we have to take. I think this is the fifth time we have been trying to move forward with this. Each time all the people on the other side of the aisle say they are for Social Security, and the President says he is for Social Security, but they never want to do anything. I guess maybe this is part of the frustration that has been building up over the last month or so, and this week there has been frustration. 
   I think it is time to invoke cloture and move forward on the lockbox issue to make sure the American people who are paying into Social Security, particularly young people who are starting to work and putting their money aside, will have some hope that there will be benefits for them. And we do that only by moving forward with our lockbox. I suggest that we do that. I thank the Senator for the time. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today in introducing a bipartisan bill to protect, preserve and improve the Social Security system for the challenges of the 21st Century. 
   We all know that Social Security faces massive demographic changes. For example, our population is aging rapidly. As a result, the ratio between the number of workers paying taxes into the system as compared to the number of retirees taking funds out of the system is falling swiftly. Soon, we will have fewer than two workers for each retiree. Other demographic trends are that Americans are living longer and retiring earlier. 
   The combined effect of these changes is that future generations will face tremendous tax burdens or massive benefit cuts in order to preserve Social Security. The longer Congress waits before reforming the law, the more painful and difficult these changes will be. 
   That's why I am pleased this bipartisan group has come together with credible reform legislation that will preserve Social Security in perpetuity. It achieves this important goal in large part through advance funding of the program. The bill allows workers to divert a portion of their existing Social Security taxes into a personal retirement account that they would own. This feature would enable all Americans to accumulate a cash nest egg for their retirement and would improve the rate of return on their Social Security taxes. 
   Currently, Congress is considering legislation to create a ``Lockbox'' that would reserve Social Security surplus revenues for Social Security alone, not other government spending as is currently the case. I support this legislation and believe it is an important first step toward saving Social Security. But to me, the true ``Lockbox'' is private retirement accounts. These accounts ensure that individual Americans, not the Federal Government, are in charge of their retirement nest egg. If the worker dies before retirement,  the accounts could be left to his or her heirs. In addition, these private accounts ensure that the Federal Government can't come back at a later time and reduce benefits. Another key feature of these accounts is that low income workers, most for the first time, will have an opportunity to own assets and create wealth. 
   Another way the bill makes Social Security more progressive is by increasing the guaranteed benefits for those with low incomes. Other important provisions in the legislation will improve the Social Security benefits of widows, repeal the earnings test, and correct perverse work incentives inherent in the current system. 
   Finally, our proposal doesn't affect current retirees. They would continue under the current system. But by reducing the tremendous unfunded liability the system faces and restoring solvency to Social Security, current retirees are protected from the potential tax increases and benefit cuts that would be necessary to preserve the system. Seniors' benefits are far more secure under this plan than they are under current law. 
   Again, I am pleased to join Senators GREGG, KERREY, BREAUX, GRASSLEY, THOMPSON and ROBB in introducing this important legislation. And I encourage the rest of our colleagues to examine this bill carefully because I think it has the elements necessary to achieve a bipartisan agreement to save Social Security. The sooner we act, the better. Time is not on our side.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today to authorize the development and maintenance of a multi-agency campus in the town of Jackson, Wyoming. 
   The management of our public lands and natural resources is often complicated and requires the coordination of many individuals to accomplish desired objectives. When western folks discuss federal land issues, we do not often have an opportunity to identify proposals that capture this type of consensus and enjoy the support from a wide array of interests; however, the multi-agency campus offers just such a unique prospect. As local, state and federal officials attempt to provide services to the public, they have identified a need to develop a campus in Jackson, Wyoming that offers visitors ``one stop shopping'' service for wildlife, tourism and resource issues. 
   The multi-agency campus includes a wildlife interpretive center, facilities for public programs, walkways, bike paths, museum space, and office locations for Wyoming Game and Fish, U.S. Forest Service and the local chamber of commerce. There are several entities involved with this effort--U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, Wyoming Game and Fish, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, U.S. Department of Interior, Teton County, Town of Jackson, Jackson Chamber of Commerce and the Jackson Hole Historical Society. Project coordinators and involved parties have spent a great deal of time incorporating the concerns of various individuals through public meetings and by presenting their plans to agency and congressional representatives. 
   This legislation is needed to improve communication between the federal agencies and related entities, and reduce costs to federal, state and local governments as they attempt to address public needs. Specifically, the bill would allow the U.S. Forest Service to transfer a small parcel of their land within the proposed campus boundaries to the Town of Jackson in exchange for the Town constructing a new administrative facility for the agency. 
   Mr. President, this bill enjoys the support of many different groups including federal agencies, state organizations and officials, as well as the local community. It is my hope that the Senate will seize this opportunity to improve upon efforts to provide services to the American public.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National Park System New Area Study Act of 2000. 
   Mr. President, last year when we passed the National Parks Vision 20-20 legislation, we made a number of revisions in the way we do business within the National Park System. One of those changes concerned the conduct of new park studies. 
   Prior to the National Park Service undertaking any new area studies, and from this point forward, Congress must act affirmatively on a list submitted by the Secretary of the Interior for studies on potential new units of the System. 
   Pursuant to Public Law 105-391, the Secretary has submitted a list and this legislation reflects the Secretary's request.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Listing and Delisting Reform Act of 1999, cosponsored by my colleague from Wyoming,  Senator ENZI. The Endangered Species Act has become one of the best examples of good intentions gone astray, and so today I am taking one small step toward injecting some common sense into what has become a regulatory nightmare. It is my intention to start making the law more effective for local landowners, public land managers, communities and state governments who truly hold the key to any successful effort to conserve species. My legislation seeks to improve the listing, recovery planning and delisting processes so that recovery, the goal of the act, is easier to achieve. 
   In Wyoming, we have seen first hand the need to revise the listing and delisting processes of the Endangered Species Act. Listing should be a purely scientific decision. Listing should be based on credible data that has been peer-reviewed. Recently, the Prebles Meadow Jumping Mouse was listed in the State of Wyoming. The listing process for this mouse demonstrates how the system has gone haywire devoid of good science. One of the more significant shortcomings of the Preble's Rule relates to confusion about claims regarding the ``known range'' of as opposed to the alleged ``historical range.'' Historical data and current knowledge do not support the high, short-grass, semi-arid plains for southeastern Wyoming as part of the mouse's historical habitat range. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has even admitted to uncertainties regarding taxonomic distinctions and ranges. Further, the State was not properly notified causing counties, commissioners, and landowners all to be caught off guard. Such poor practices do not foster the types of partnerships that are required if meaningful species conservation is to occur. Clearly, changes are desperately needed to the Endangered Species Act. 
   Not far behind the mouse in Wyoming, is the black tailed prairie dog. Petitions to list the prairie dog have been filed and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has said the petition is not only warranted but deserves further study. I have lived in Wyoming most of my life, and I have logged a lot of miles on the roads and highways in my State over the years. I can tell you from experience that there is no shortage of prairie dogs in Wyoming. Any farmer or rancher will concur with that opinion. This petition, and countless other actions throughout the country, makes it painfully clear that some folks are intent on completely eliminating activity on public lands, no matter what the cost to individuals or local communities that rely on the land for economic survival. 
   My legislation will require the Secretary of the Interior to use scientific or commercial data that is empirical, field tested and peer-reviewed. Right now, it is basically a ``postage stamp'' petition: any person who wants to start a listing process may petition a species with little or no scientific support. This legislation prevents this absurd practice by establishing minimum requirements for a listing petition that includes an analysis of the status of the species, its range, population trends and threats. The petition must also be peer reviewed. In order to list a species, the Secretary must determine if sufficient biological information exists in the petition to support a recovery plan. Under my proposal, states are made active participants in the process and the general public is provided a more substantial role. 
   This legislation requires explicit planning and forethought with regard to conservation and recovery at the time the species is listed. Let me be clear about the intent of this requirement. I do not question the basic premise that some species require the protection of the Endangered Species Act. However, listing a species can cause hardship on a community. For that reason, it is critically important and only reasonable that every listing be supported by sound science. We should be sure of the need for a listing before we ask the members of our communities and private landowners to make sacrifices. 
   In my State of Wyoming, I have found that with several listings, the Secretary of the Interior is unable to tell me what measures will be required to achieve species recovery. The Secretary cannot tell me what acts or omissions we can expect to face as a consequence of listing. How can this be, if the Secretary is fully apprized of the status of the species? Conversely, if the Secretary cannot clearly describe how to reverse threatening acts to a species so that we can achieve recovery, how can we be sure that the species is, in fact, threatened? 
   This ambiguity has caused much undue frustration to the people of Wyoming. If the Secretary believes that certain farming or ranching practices, or the diversion of a certain amount of water, or a private citizen's development of one's own property, is the cause for a listing, then the Secretary should identify those activities that have to be curtailed or changed. If the Secretary does not have enough information to indicate what activities should be restricted, then why list a species? Why open producers and others to the burden of over-zealous enforcement and even litigation without being able to achieve the goal of recovering the species? 
   This legislation is ultimately designed to improve the quality of information used to support a listing. If the Secretary knows enough to list a species, he should know enough to tell us what will be required for recovery. That should be the case under current law, and that is all that this provision would require. 
   Just as the beginning of the process needs changes, we need to revise the end of the process--the delisting procedure. Recovery and delisting are quite simply, the goals of the Endangered Species Act. Yet, it is virtually impossible to currently delist a species. There is no certainty in the process and the States--the folks who have all the responsibility for managing the species once it is off the list--are not true partners in that process. Once the recovery plan is met, the species should be delisted. 
   Wyoming's experience with the Grizzly Bear pinpoints some of the problems with the current delisting process. The Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee set criteria for recovery and in the Yellowstone ecosystem, those targets have been met, but the bear has still not been removed from the list. We've been battling the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for years over this one to noavail, despite tremendous effort and financial resources to meet recovery objectives. Despite rebounded populations, we keep funneling money down a black hole. 
   The point is something needs to be done. My constituents, rightly so, are angry and upset about this current law and the trickling effects of countless listings. Real lives are being impacted. It is time for some real changes. These are small changes but I believe they will make big impacts. The changes I have suggested will have a significant effect on the quality of science, public participation, state involvement, speed in recovery and finally the delisting of a species. Species that truly need protection will be protected, but let's not lose sight of the real goal--recovery and delisting.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, rural states are particularly affected by satellite service. Telecommunications is changing the way things are done, providing more and more of our services through satellites. Yet we have difficulty with people who live in low-density areas, people who live in the country, receiving their local satellite service. 
   This is a common problem in a low-density State such as Wyoming, where we have fewer people, where we have more rural areas. Many issues we work on have a unique impact on people who live in rural areas. The reregulation of electricity, for example, has a different impact in Wyoming than it does in Pennsylvania. That is true, also, with the delivery of health care services. 
   It is important, when we deal with nationwide issues, that we also take some time to give special attention to the differences that exist among consumers in the country. That is particularly true with TV. Technology and satellite TV have allowed TV services to be delivered in places it could never be delivered before. However, there are many rural people who cannot receive over the air television signals. That is the case in Wyoming. 
   Technology and satellite TV are great because they often provide people with more services. Indeed, it does. But it is difficult to provide local TV, local news, and local emergency signals that are given by the local stations. When a satellite company cannot do that, customers get their NBC broadcast in Rawlins, WY, they receive it from Chicago. That is a problem in terms of being able to have those local services available to consumers. 
   It is important, No. 1, we maintain local broadcast markets. It is important, as well, that people who live in that vicinity have the opportunity to see local news, to hear about local activities, to participate locally. The problem is, how do you provide satellite service and at the same time provide local news and local activities, as well? 
   This week, the Senate-House conference will be meeting regarding the Satellite Home Viewers Improvement Act. Hopefully, something will come out of that. This is legislation which will enable more customers to receive broadcast network television. The question is, of course, who can adequately receive local service from their own antenna and who can receive these local broadcasts through a staellite provider. 
   I had meetings in Wyoming this week. We only have two areas in Wyoming where the local TV has a designated area; the others do not. There are 15 States that do not have local-to-local service at all. When people up for satellite TV and they want the national broadcast--which is done locally, if you can receive that from an antenna--viewers are blocked from receiving it on the satellite. 
   The difficulty is determining the strength of the signal that comes to that antenna. There is a great difference of view about that. Frankly, it is very uncertain who makes that determination. 
   The first issue is determining the strength of the signal. You have to find out if that signal is strong enough so you qualify to get it over your antenna, or have a technician show that it isn't. 
   That is the difference of view. There needs to be a third party who says, whether you have adequate signal strength. Some viewers are behind a mountain or in a valley and can't get it. That is part of the problem. 
   Another problem is considering the local market. Over 25 percent of the viewers in Wyoming receive their TV from satellites. This is the third highest percentage, I believe, in the United States. That is not a huge number of people, but it is a very high percentage of people. 
   Without satellite access of course, the customers have no TV at all. Under the current situation, the TV they do get often comes from distant network stations. 
   There are two problems. One is that there has been a moratorium so these viewers could continue to get their services. That moratorium is scheduled to expire at the end of this month for folks in Grade A. In the Grade B contour network service expires at the end of the year; and there is nothing to be done in the interim. We need to deal with the immediacy of the problem--hopefully give customers another moratorium to continue network service. Second, we need to decide how we can get local-to-local coverage, how we can get the local TV station carried in a ``must carry'' proposition. 
   There are two difficulties. One, I am told--and I am not completely persuaded--that there is a lack of capacity on the satellites. In order to do that, additional satellites must be launched to carry all the local stations so people can get local broadcasts. Of course, that runs into the third issue--money. 
   I know the folks in Kansas would be just as excited about having TV coverage as the folks in Wyoming; and I am sure the Presiding Officer would be instrumental in making this happen. 
   In summary, I think many individuals would like to use satellites for their TV viewing. People in the country also want to have their local station available to them. They do not want to be blocked from receiving NBC or CBS because they are within the area that their local station carries, despite the fact they can't get it well on their own TV. 
   This is a problem that can have a happy resolution. Ideally, everyone could receive TV and have a good picture. Ideally, everyone could view their local station. We will work toward this end. I hope the conference committee meeting now can help find a way to provide a remedy for the short term and then set up an efficient system as we look to the future. 
   We have written a letter to the committee--I think there are 24 signatures on this letter--urging they set up a commission to determine how this might be done to resolve the question in the long term. I am optimistic that can be done.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk for a few minutes about agriculture appropriations. That is the bill that is before us. It is one I believe is particularly important. But I want to talk, really, about the need for us to be doing the necessary work of the Congress to be moving forward with our appropriations bills to keep the Government operating. These are the things we have before us. We have to pass 13 bills before this Congress is adjourned, before the 30th of September. We have to do this to keep the operations of the Government moving, particularly in the area of agriculture where we are having one of the toughest times we have had in the economics of agriculture, all over the country. It has been very difficult. Of course the appropriations bill for agriculture will be there to help. There will be other things done as well, but this is the basic effort we will have to make. 
   I am very sorry to say our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have seen fit to delay this bill by using stalling tactics and bringing up unrelated amendments that have caused us not to be able to move forward. This is not a question of which issue is most important. We believe, with all of these issues, it is a question of an orderly process of moving forward to do the things that we have to do to accomplish our assignments. 
   I am sorry to say we are not able to do our job. It has been derailed by what I believe is simply an effort to bring partisan political issues to this debate which really do not have a place in this situation. 
   One, we need to move forward with the appropriations bills; there is no question about that. Two, we are dealing with patients' rights, which we have dealt with before and with which we continue to deal. It is not a question of being willing to do it. We have a Republican bill for patients' rights. 
   Are there some disagreements, some differences? Of course. We have been talking about this for more than a year. It is completely inappropriate to bring it up now and use it as a stalling tactic. 
   The unfortunate part is this is not the first time we have had it happen. We had it happen just 2 weeks ago when we were talking about Social Security, and we were unable to move forward with the lockbox legislation. We are finding an unusual amount of disruption in moving forward with the business of this Congress. 
   I commend the Subcommittee on Agriculture Appropriations for their hard work in putting this bill together. The lion's share of funding, $47 billion, is designated for mandatory programs. Domestic food programs, food stamps, and child nutrition programs account for more than half of the agriculture appropriations bill. 
   Certainly, the subcommittee faced difficult challenges in crafting this bill. Industry is struggling. The requests for financial assistance are escalating. Those types of things are very real, and we are prepared to deal with them. All we need to do is have the opportunity to move forward. 
   Unfortunately, the stalling tactics have stopped us. For those of us who are primarily from agricultural States, passage of this bill is fundamental to our economy and fundamental to those agricultural producers. 
   Recently, I heard several of my colleagues describe the financial problems in agriculture, and I do not disagree with any of them. We are feeling those in my State of Wyoming. 
   I am very frustrated we cannot take action on a bill because it has been bogged down. We should focus on this bill. We should get this one done. We can do it. There is general agreement on it. We can deal with the disagreements and move forward.  
   There are a number of programs in this agriculture bill that are particularly important. In addition to the domestic food programs, it contains funding for activities that are essential to an industry that employs more people in this country than any other industry, and that is agricultural producers. It has to do with land grant universities. It has to do with our rural citizens. 
   Of particular importance to Wyoming, a State where 50 percent of the State belongs to the Federal Government and is managed by the BLM and Forest Service, there are funds for predator management which is particularly important, even important in places like Hawaii. It has to do with decreasing livestock losses and crop losses. It has to do with research and extension. 
   We have the most efficient agriculture in the world because we have had land grant colleges and we have had the extension service. We have been able to produce more efficiently than anyone else. It is one of the largest exports we have. 
   There are conservation initiatives. Mr. President, $800 million is provided in this bill to assist farmers and ranchers to be stewards of the land, to be environmental stewards, to reduce soil erosion, to reduce nonpoint water pollution. The list of positive programs in this bill goes on and on. 
   For food safety, there is $638 million, an increase of $24 million over the fiscal year 1999 level. 
   Also in the bill are agricultural credit programs--the Presiding Officer is one of the experts with a background in agriculture and has worked on this problem--loan authorization for rural housing, and assistance for rural communities to develop waste disposal and solid waste management programs. 
   To brush this off and say we have other things to do, we should not undertake to deal with this agricultural appropriations, is distressing to me. I want us to move forward with it. 
   It is important, of course, not only to producers but to all of us as citizens of this country when we talk about safe food. 
   When we are finally able to debate the agriculture appropriations bill, there will be numerous amendments, as there should be. Some will be controversial which will further delay the passage of the bill. 
   We ought to also keep in mind that in order to go forward with the programs of this country, we need to move forward. We have about four appropriations bills that have been passed. Our goal should be to pass at least 11 of them by the end of July. We do not want to find ourselves in this business of having political problems that shut down the Government, as we did several years ago, and trying to blame each other. 
   Instead, we ought to move forward and do the things we ought to be doing. We have a process and we ought to move forward with it. There is much to be done, and I urge my colleagues to end their tactics of derailing and allow us to move forward on this very important spending bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I am encouraged by what my friends on the other side have said. On an issue they wouldn't let us talk about yesterday--that is called Social Security--they talk about wanting to get things to the floor and get it done--yesterday every one of them voted against moving forward with the lockbox to do something with Social Security. It is a little bit incongruous with what they are saying today. That is one of the real major issues we need to talk about. 
   I might add, over the last couple of years there has been a Patients' Bill of Rights on the floor. It has been offered. The reason it hasn't gone anywhere is because the other side has to have amendments that have no relevance to the bill, and go on and on. 
   If they would like to pass something, I suggest to them we put something out there, stick to the issue and do it. I see they have disappeared. 
   Let me talk about Social Security. It seems to me it is one of the things we are focused on; it is one of the things that is on our Republican list to complete this year. We are probably not going to reform Social Security in this session, so we do need to make a move, and the move is the lockbox--to take the surplus that is now all Social Security that comes in this year and seek to ensure that it is used for that purpose. For a very long time, this has not been the case. The money that has come in for Social Security, of course, has been put into Government securities, and has been spent for other things. For the first time in 25 years, we have a surplus, even though it is Social Security. So it is time, I believe, to do something to put that money aside for the purpose for which it is extracted from you and me as taxpayers. 
   Is the lockbox the ultimate solution? Of course not. But it is a way for us to control what that money is used for, to stop the idea, which the President supports, of $158 billion in expenditures on other issues using Social Security money. 
   Everyone knows that we have to do something if we intend to have Social Security in the future for the young people who are now starting to pay, as well as paying the beneficiaries that we now have. It wasn't many years ago that Social Security was thought to be the third-rail politics and nobody could touch it, otherwise they would be dead. Now we come to the realization that if we want to continue this program over the years--particularly so young people beginning to pay and who have many years to look forward to will get some benefit--we have to do something. The sooner we do it, the less  drastic the change will have to be. I think most everyone would agree that is a fact. 
   In the year 2014, Social Security will begin to run a deficit. So we need to look forward to that time. The options are fairly easy to understand. One, of course, is that you could raise taxes. I don't know of many people, given the 12 percent of our payroll that we now pay, would want to increase that. For many folks in this country, Social Security withholding is the highest tax they pay, and it is a substantial one. The other, of course, is to change the benefits, change the age, and do those kinds of things. There may be some tinkering with that, but basically the benefits will not be changed. 
   It leaves a third option, which I think is a good one, and that is to take the money that we have paid in--each of us--a certain percentage of that becomes an amount of money that is in our account, and it can be invested in equities, which returns a higher yield. That is really the third option that we need to look at. The opportunity to do that is probably somewhere ahead of us. So the lockbox, then, becomes the important thing now--to put that money aside so that we don't spend it. 
   There are, in my opinion, other reasons for doing that as well. This is one of the big debates here, as you can tell by listening just a few moments ago. There are those who want more and more Government spending, and others would like to restrict the size of the Federal Government, to move more of the decisions back to counties and States and individuals. That is the debate--a legitimate debate between those who want more taxes and more spending and those who would like to have a smaller Government, to bring it down to only those essential things. When you have a surplus, that is very difficult to do. 
   So if we are talking about maintaining a budget, which we are very proud of, having spending caps, in which the budget ceiling has been the largest contributor to having a balanced budget, if we are interested in doing those things, those are all part of setting aside this Social Security money. Over time, hopefully, in the future, as this surplus extends not only to Social Security, but to the regular operational budget, we will have an opportunity to have some tax reform and to return some of this money to people so they can spend it for their families, so they can spend it to do some of the things our friends were just talking about a few moments ago. 
   I think it is very important that we take it up. We have voted three times now to move forward with the lockbox. We asked to be able to go forward with this. Each time our friends on the other side of the aisle have said no. Everyone on that side of the aisle voted no yesterday. They said, no, we don't want to set the money aside, but they are up today saying here is where we want to make new expenditures of billions of dollars. There is something incongruous about that. We need to make some decisions about where we are. 
   I think Republicans have four pretty well-defined goals we are working toward. One is Social Security--not just to say save Social Security, as the President has said, and not do anything, but to actually do something. 
   Two is to do something about education. We have moved forward to do that. We have the Ed-Flex Program, for one, that has moved decisions back to the schools boards and the States 
   and counties where they ought to be for educational decisions. 
   We are talking about tax reform. We need to have tax reform. I noticed last night somebody did a study of the whole world, and we are the second highest in the world on estate taxes, topped only by Japan. It is time that we did some tax reform and some of those things. Then security, of course, for the benefit our country, we have done a great deal on that, in strengthening the military. 
   I hope we will stop just talking about these things and actually do something. I'm talking about going forward with issues. We had a chance yesterday to go forward with an issue, and we had 45 votes against it. I hope we can move forward. One of the most important items in this country is Social Security, and the first step would be lockbox. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for bringing this subject, his amendment, to the floor. We are talking about lockbox legislation. We are talking about Social Security, which is the bottom line. Lockbox is simply the first step to accomplish that. We have had in our agenda this year: Social Security, tax reform, education, and security for this country. These are the things we have been talking about and will, indeed, continue to talk about. 
   The two Senators from the other side of the aisle have spoken about excuses for not going forward with this bill. I can hardly understand it. They talk about amendments. They have 22 or 25 amendments designed to keep us from voting on the bill. That is why we are not doing amendments. We decided to move forward with something designed to ensure that Social Security surplus funds will be reserved for Social Security alone. There are lots of things involved, of course, in addition to Social Security. That is, if you like smaller government, if you like tax relief, if you would like to limit the amount of spending, then this is the way to do that and hold the spending to those funds that do not come from Social Security. So this helps us retain our commitment to smaller and more efficient government. 
   One only has to look at last year's omnibus appropriations to see this legislation is necessary, where $20 billion in nonemergency spending was taken from Social Security last year. The same thing will happen again unless we make a move to do something about it. Unfortunately, the Democrats have decided to filibuster this bill and not let it happen. Apparently they support these ideas of raiding Social Security for their big government agenda. I understand that. The President's budget raids the Social Security funds to the tune of $158 billion. That is where we are, absent this kind of movement. 
   We are, of course, dealing with everything from lockbox to fundamental Social Security reforms. Everybody knows the system is not sound; by 2014, Social Security begins to run a deficit. Obviously, there are a number of demographics that bring that about--the declining number of workers, their increased longevity, and the impending retirement of the baby boomers. There are three solutions to the problem: One is to raise taxes on Social Security, one is to reduce benefits of Social Security--neither of which is acceptable to most of us--and the third is to provide an increased rate of return on the investments we have. 
   I am not for raising taxes. There are better ways to do that. I certainly want, however, to do something with Social Security which will allow a certain part of those funds to be put in private accounts to be invested in the private sector to increase the returns so we strengthen Social Security. We cannot do that unless we set aside these funds.  
   I am amazed at the opposition to this. The President has been talking for 2 years and all he said was: Save Social Security; no plan, no effort, no movement. 
   Now we have a chance to take the first steps to do something. We have a plan that works to move us to save Social Security, and what do we have? Opposition by filibuster. It is amazing to me. I guess it is simply a defense of spending more for large government. I do not want to do that. Americans work hard for their money. They ought to have a say in how it is spent. Therefore, I urge we move forward with the 
   first step in doing something about Social Security. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, amendment No. 437 to S. 1059, the Defense Authorization bill, prohibits the return to a foreign country of any portion of a memorial to American veterans without the express authorization of Congress. 
   I would not have thought that an amendment like this was necessary, Mr. President. It would never have occurred to me that an administration would even briefly consider dismantling part of a memorial to American soldiers who died in the line of duty in order to send a piece of that memorial to a foreign country; but a real possibility of just that happening exists in my state of Wyoming involving what are known as the ``Bells of Balangiga.'' 
   In 1898, the Treaty of Paris brought to a close the Spanish-American War.  As part of the treaty, Spain ceded possession of the Philippines to the United States. At about the same time, the Filipino people began an insurrection in their country. In August 1901, as part of the American efforts to stem the insurrection, a company of 74 officers and men from the 9th Infantry, Company G, occupied the town of Balangiga on the island of Samar. These men came from Ft. Russel in Cheyenne, WY--today's F.E. Warren Air Force Base. 
   On September 28 of that year, taking advantage of the preoccupation of the American troops with a church service for the just-assassinated President McKinley, a group of Filipino insurgents infiltrated the town. Only three American sentries were on duty that day. As described in an article in the November 19, 1997 edition of the Wall Street Journal:  
   Officers slept in, and enlisted men didn't bother to carry their rifles as they ambled out of their quarters for breakfast. Balangiga had been a boringly peaceful site since the infantry company arrived a month earlier, according to military accounts and soldiers' statements. The quiet ended abruptly when a 23 year old U.S. sentry named Adolph Gamlin walked past the local police chief. In one swift move, the Filipino grabbed the slightly built Iowan's rifle and smashed the butt across [Gamlin's] head. As PFC Gamlin crumpled, the bells of Balangiga began to peal. 
   With the signal, hundreds of Filipino fighters swarmed out of the surrounding forest, armed with clubs, picks and machete-like bolo knives. Others poured out of the church; they had arrived the night before, disguised as women mourners and carrying coffins filled with bolos. A sergeant was beheaded in the mess tent and dumped into a vat of steaming wash water. A young bugler was cut down in a nearby stream. The company commander was hacked to death after jumping out a window. Besieged infantrymen defended themselves with kitchen forks, mess kits and baseball bats. Others threw rocks and cans of beans. 
   Though he was also slashed across the back, PFC ..... Gamlin came to and found a rifle. By the time he and the other survivors fought their way to the beach, 38 US soldiers were dead and all but six of the remaining men had been wounded.  
   The remaining soldiers escaped in five dug-out canoes. Only three boats made it to safety on Leyte. Seven men died of exposure at sea, and other 8 died of their wounds; only 20 of the company's 74 members survived. 
   A detachment of 54 volunteers from 9th infantry units stationed at Leyte returned to Balangiga and recaptured the village. They were reinforced a few days later from Companies K and L of the 11th Infantry Regiment. When the 11th Infantry was relieved on October 18 by Marines, the 9th Infantry took two of the church bells and an old canon with them back to Wyoming as memorials to the fallen soldiers. 
   The bells and canon have been displayed in front of the base flagpole on the central parade grounds since that time. The canon was restored by local volunteers and placed under a glass display case in 1985 to protect it from the elements. The bells were placed in openings in a large specially constructed masonry wall with a plaque dedicating the memorial to the memory of the fallen soldiers. 
   Off and on since 1981, there have been some discussions in various circles in Cheyenne, Washington, and Manila about the future of the bells, including the possibility of returning them to the Philippines. Most recently, the Philippine government--having run into broad opposition to their request to have both bells returned to them--has proposed making a copy of both bells, and having both sides keep one copy and one original. Opposition to the proposal from local and national civic and veterans groups has been very strong. 
   Last year, developments indicated to me that the White House was seriously contemplating returning one or both of the bells to the Philippines. 1998 marked the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Paris, and a state visit by then-President Fidel Ramos--his last as President--to the United States. The disposition of the bells was high on President Ramos' agenda; he has spoken personally to President Clinton and several members of Congress about it over the last three years, and made it one of only three agenda items the Filipino delegation brought to the table. Since January 1998, the Filipino press has included almost weekly articles on the bells' supposed return, including several in the Manila Times in April and May which reported that a new tower to house the bells was being constructed in Borongon, Samar, to receive them in May. In addition, there have been a variety of reports vilifying me and the veterans in Wyoming for our position on the issue, and others threatening economic boycotts of US products or other unspecified acts of retaliation to force capitulation on the issue. 
   Moreover, inquiries to me from various agencies of the administration soliciting the opinion of the Wyoming congressional delegation on the issue increased in frequency in the first 4 months of 1998. I also learned that the Defense Department, perhaps in conjunction with the Justice Department, prepared a legal memorandum outlining its opinion of who actually controls the disposition of the bells. 
   In response, the Wyoming congressional delegation wrote a letter to President Clinton on January 9, 1998, to make clear our opposition to removing the bells. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of that letter be inserted at this point in the RECORD. In response to that letter, on May 26, I received a letter from Sandy Berger of the National Security Council which I think is perhaps one of the best indicators of the direction the White House was headed on this issue. 
   To head off any move by the administration to dispose of the bells, I and Senator ENZI introduced S. 1903 on April 1, 1998. The bill had 18 cosponsors, including the distinguished Chairmen of the Committees on Armed Services, Foreign Relations, Finance, Energy and Natural Resources, Rules, Ethics, and Banking; the Chairmen of five Subcommittees of the Foreign Relations Committee; and five members of the Armed Services Committee. 
   While time has passed since this issue came to a head last April, Mr. President, my deep concern that the administration might still dispose of the bells has not. The administration has not disavowed its earlier intent to seek to return the bells--an intent derailed by the introduction of S. 1903 last year. In addition, despite article IV, section 3, clause 2 of the Constitution, which states that the ``Congress shall have the power to dispose of ..... Property belonging to the United States,'' the Justice Department has issued an informal memorandum stating that the bells could possibly be disposed of by the President pursuant to the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &#167;2572. 
   I continue to be amazed, even in these days of political correctness and revisionist history, that a U.S. President--our Commander in Chief--would appear to be ready to ignore the wishes of our veterans and tear down a memorial to U.S. soldiers who died in the line of duty in order to send part of it back to the country in which they were killed. Amazed, that is, until I recall this President's fondness for sweeping apologies and what some might view as flashy P.R. gestures. Consequently, Senator ENZI and I decided to pursue the issue again in the 106th Congress. 
   Mr. President, to the veterans of Wyoming, and the United States as a whole, the bells represent a lasting memorial to those 54 American soldiers killed as a result of an unprovoked insurgent attack in Balangiga on September 28, 1901, In their view, which I share, any attempt to remove either or both of the bells--and in doing so actually physically dismantling a war memorial--is a desecration of that memory. 
   This amendment will protect the bells and similar veterans memorials from such an ignoble fate. The bill is quite simple; it prohibits the transfer of a veterans memorial or any portion thereof to a foreign country or government unless specifically authorized by law. I would like to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Committee [Senator WARNER] for his assistance, and that of his staff, in moving this amendment forward.

   Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. I will take just a couple of minutes. 
   I rise in opposition to the McCain-Levin amendment on base closure. It is a difficult decision for me because I am persuaded there could be some closures that would make us more efficient in terms of our mission in defense. I remember my friend, Dick Cheney, whose place I took in the House, said that defense is not for economic development; it is for defense. I appreciate that, and I believe that. 
   I was not at all impressed with the last process. I was not at all impressed with the way the administration handled it, so I do not believe that it is appropriate at this time to bring in the politics again of base closure. Frankly, the military ought to come forward with their views as to what is necessary to carry out their mission. That, of course, should be our particular desire.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue of critical importance to the domestic lamb industry and to producers in my home state of Wyoming. In September 1998, a coalition of individuals from all segments of the U.S. lamb industry filed a Section 201 trade petition with the U.S. International Trade Commission under laws  embedded in the Trade Act of 1974 and every trade act this nation has agreed to since that time. 
   Our domestic industry filed this trade case in response to the surging, record-setting levels of imported lamb meat from Australia and New Zealand. These individuals, although representing different sectors of the U.S. lamb industry, collectively signed onto this legal battle because each entity has witnessed a drastic impact from lamb imports--imports that increased nearly 50 percent between 1993 and 1997 and continue at an aggressive rate still today. 
   Under a Section 201 petition, the International Trade Commission is required to conduct an investigation to confirm or dispel the claims asserted within the trade case. Twice the Commissioners heard arguments from both the domestic industry and the importers. Twice the Commissioners rejected the importers arguments. In both instances, the Commissioners voted unanimously--during the injury phase in February and again in March, when they recommended that the President impose some form of trade relief. The Commission's report, and the industry's trade case, now await a final determination by President Clinton. 
   According to the Commission's report, wholesale imported lamb cuts consistently undercut the price of identical domestic cuts. Evidence of importers underselling domestically produced lamb was found in 79 percent of the product-to-product comparisons with margins of 20 percent to 40 percent. Other comparisons have found margin disparities reaching as high as 70 percent. It is evident that our domestic industry is suffering from the flood of cheap, imported lamb that has swamped the U.S. market and forced prices below break-even levels. 
   Time is of the essence in this matter as President Clinton has until June 4, 1999, to render his decision on what trade relief, if any, to implement. It is important to remember that under our own trade laws, the requirement of demonstrating that imports are threatening serious injury to the domestic industry has been met. As a result, I urge the President to impose strong, effective and temporary trade relief. More importantly, I urge the President to act on behalf of our producers by seriously considering the undisputed facts outlined in the Commission's report.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to come in this morning when we had a break in regular business to talk about something that is very important to me and to Wyoming. As a matter of fact, it is also important in States such as Kansas. I am speaking about promoting health in rural areas. 
   I am joining with several colleagues in introducing a bill promoting health in rural areas, a bill designed to increase access to quality health care services in rural areas. Rural health care has been a priority of mine since I have been in the House and Senate. As cochair of the Rural Health Care Caucus, I am pleased that health care in rural areas is an issue that we can address in a bipartisan way. 
   So I am very pleased to work with colleagues, including the Presiding Officer, Senator ROBERTS; Senator GRASSLEY; Senator HARKIN; Senator BAUCUS; Senator DASCHLE; Senator CONRAD, and Senator COLLINS, to craft this bill. It is always a pleasure to work with people who have similar issues, and certainly we do in rural areas. 
   This bill provides some incentives, regulatory relief and Medicare payment equity, needed to ensure rural families have access to quality health care, the kind of health care that they deserve. Those of us who come from low-population areas have unique problems. We talk about education, we talk about schools, and we talk about the delivery of health care. Quite frankly, it is different in Greybull, WY, than it is in Philadelphia. So when we have national programs such as Medicare, it is important that we 
   recognize some of the problems that exist in rural areas are unique and, indeed, need to be dealt with differently--problems such as the lack of physicians and health care providers in rural areas, and the idea that Medicare reimbursement has actually been unfair and unequal and not uniform throughout the country. 
   I recall last year when we were talking about Medicare payments to HMOs, the payments that were available in some places in the east were $700 a month. In the Midwest, it was $250 a month under the same kind of program. So there is some unfairness there. Certainly, we have experienced limited access to mental health. I think this is particularly true for young people. In rural areas, you simply don't have the kinds of rural health care access that is necessary and should be provided. 
   One of the techniques that will be used increasingly, I am sure, in rural health care is telemedicine, where you can go from a family practitioner to a specialty on telemedicine and get at least many of the same quality kinds of health care advantages. 
   Many of these problems were explored last summer when we held a forum in Casper, WY. We brought in people interested in health care, not only providers and patients but others. Many ideas were talked about there, such as how we can strengthen health care in Wyoming. We came up with a consensus in a number of these areas, and this bill contains many of those recommendations. I am pleased about that. 
   Here are some of the solutions. One of the things we discovered in our health care seminar is that in big cities you have all the different kinds of specialists and different techniques for health care, but you don't have them in small towns. So it is necessary, then, to have a network so you can tie it in. Small towns aren't often able to have a fully qualified hospital that will receive payments for Medicare from HCFA. So we had to arrange to have what we call ``acute care hospitals'' that can provide a lesser but equally important service, so that people could have emergency care, for example, and then be transported to another place, or the full service hospital. So you need a network there. 
   We need assistance in recruiting physicians, as you can imagine. It is difficult sometimes to bring in doctors--particularly specialists--to low-population areas. So these are some of the problems that we talked about. 
   This bill ensures rural health care representation on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. There is an advisory commission that has oversight responsibilities, and there is no assurance that there would be anyone there with a background and experience in a rural area. These are the things we have done. Specifically, it increases the reimbursement rates for hospitals and clinics. 
   Medicare reimbursement rates have been unfair and inadequate. Health care costs have been undervalued. You should receive the same kind of value care there as somewhere else. The cost of living is somewhat less, perhaps, but not to the extent that the payments have been made different. 
   We think one of the results of that, of course, is the difficulty to get providers to come there. Their reimbursement is less than it is in Florida or other places for doing the same thing. So we revised the rates. 
   The bill increases payments to sole community hospitals 
   and, of course, that is what we have. My first recollection in talking about this is when the Presiding Officer was in the House and we talked in Kansas about having a special program for small town hospitals, and that happened and has worked well. Recruiting and maintaining providers, of course, is a problem. In Wyoming, we have 22 underserved areas. That means there is less than one primary care physician for every 3,500 people living in those areas. It is also appropriate, of course, to advocate for other professionals, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants. In many areas, those are the types of professionals that will be in small towns. 
   Telemedicine, of course, can be the salvation of rural America, and it is moving quickly. 
   This bill expands the number of telemedicine services reimbursed by Medicare, which will be very useful in establishing a well-coordinated network of physicians, midlevel practitioners, hospitals and clinics. This is especially important if you have a nurse practitioner or physician assistant, for instance, in a small town and they need advice from a specialist. They can do that using telemedicine. 
   Mental health. As you can imagine, access to mental health care is quite limited in rural areas. So this bill expands and ensures coverage by Medicare for mental health types of things. I mentioned the MEDPAC. Two years ago, Congress established the Medical Payment Advisory Commission, designed to make policy recommendations in part A and part B of Medicare. Unfortunately, on the current 15-member board, only one member is from a rural area. This bill requires that at least two be on the board to give adequate input. 
   In conclusion, I am very pleased with this bill to promote better health care in rural areas. It provides assistance to many rural communities that have trouble getting the quality health care that people receive in bigger cities. This is designed to do that. It is possible that we can debate it this year. The Rural Health Care Caucus will be working, and perhaps it will be part of a broader health care effort. This is a good start, and I am pleased to be a part of it.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as chairman of the Subcommittee on the East Asia and Pacific Affairs, I have been very much interested in the unfortunate bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade over the weekend. 
   Clearly, in my opinion, this was a tragic mistake. It has been suggested by some that it was done on purpose. I don't believe that. I think it was a mistake--one for which there is no excuse.  It boggles the mind to think that someone could make such a mistake. It is my hope that the matter will be thoroughly investigated and that a proper explanation will be made. 
   It was a mistake for which both the President and the Secretary of State have apologized to People's Republic of China. I add my apology to theirs. There is no minimizing this unfortunate accident. But I also must say to the Chinese that it would be a mistake to inflame the situation, and to fail to adequately protect our embassies and our consulates in China. 
   The Government there has apparently organized busloads of students to travel to the Embassy in Beijing. By the way, I was there not long ago. This is one of the least protected embassies in our system. It is very old, and it is not satisfactory from a safety standpoint. 
   While public security officials in Beijing apparently prevent their citizens from storming the Embassy, they do nothing to prevent the throwing of stones and Molotov cocktails, and people have damaged the Embassy. 
   Our consulate in Chungdu was partially destroyed by fire. The Government has allowed citizens to effectively hold the Ambassador hostage in our Embassy for the past 3 days. The Chinese press has failed to mention, purposefully I suspect, that we and NATO have apologized for the bombing, nor has the media noted that the bombing was accidental rather than premeditated. 
   We have had and continue to have a strategic relationship with the People's Republic of China. Certainly we have not agreed on many things. Certainly we have been critical of many things. On the other hand, that relationship has grown over the last several years. China has changed substantially. We have a great number of things going on between our countries. Almost everyone would agree that, assuming we could get over the main obstacles, a relationship between that large country with 1.2 billion people and our country is something that is jointly advantageous. We have an economic relationship. We are working on and I think have been coming rather close to, an agreement on the World Trade Organization, which I favor. I think we would be much better off dealing with China within the WTO rather than having to do it unilaterally. If we are going to be in the world community, then these are things which I think are particularly important. 
   I suspect that some Chinese are using this incident as a way of responding to some of the criticisms of them and their practices that we have had over time. We have had it on espionage; we have had it on human rights, and properly so, I suspect. But they are using this, in my view, as a means of responding to some of the criticisms we have had. 
   I think it would be a mistake if we let this unfortunate incident interfere with the opportunity to have a stronger relationship. I think it would be a mistake if we let this be an opportunity for Milosevic to begin to do something with his image and come out with a better deal than he deserves. I hope that doesn't happen. We both have--a great deal at risk. 
   Mr. President, I hope, despite all the problems, that we can solve this. I think it would be wrong for either side to use this bombing and subsequent reaction of Chinese citizens to poison the bilateral relationship which we have an opportunity to develop in the future. As we know, there is a great deal at stake in all of our relationships throughout the world. 
   Mr. President, I thank you for the time. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank you very much for the opportunity to discuss this important issue. 
   First, let me, too, say that I appreciate the work that is being done on this whole financial modernization bill. I think it is something that certainly needs to be done and that I support. 
   I also believe very strongly in what the Senator from Nebraska has just said with regard to takings--that the idea that we cannot change the rules in the Congress without it being exposed to takings is one that is very threatening. I think that is the case. 
   So I am very pleased to be a sponsor of this thrift charter amendment with my colleagues, Senator JOHNSON and Senator KERREY. I think the amendment will improve the underlying legislation by stopping a mixture of banking and commerce through the unitary thrift charter arrangement. 
   This amendment freezes the number of commercially owned thrifts and bans the future number of sales of unitary thrift charters to commercial entities. Commercial firms that already own thrifts would be able to continue the endeavor, and they are grandfathered. 
   The integration of banking and commerce raises significant questions about the concentration of economic resources. I happen to be chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific Rim and have had some opportunities recently to be in South Korea and Japan. I have to tell you that I am impressed with the problems they have had with that kind of integration, and I do not want us to get into that. 
   I have already mentioned that I do not believe this is a taking. I believe this is actually a change in direction, one that very much needs to be made, and I think it will help us in terms of this mixing of banking and commerce. It is a significant cause for the Asian economic crisis. 
   I believe we should learn from the lessons of the Asia financial crisis and be very careful about this integration. I think this will help do that. 
   In testimony before the Banking Committee last year, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan spoke to the risks that can arise if the relationships continue between banking and commercial firms. Both he and Secretary Rubin have testified to 
   the need for closing the loophole. This amendment secures the safety and soundness of our financial system, and I urge that it be supported. 
   Let me just comment on some things that very knowledgeable people have said. 
   Secretary Rubin has said:  
   [W]e support the prohibition against forming additional unitary holding companies, and [we] would further support an amendment terminating the grandfather rights.......  
   Former Federal Reserve Board Governor Paul Volcker said:  
   Recent experience with the banking crises in countries as different in their stages of development as Japan, Indonesia, and Russia demonstrates the folly of permitting industrial-financial conglomerates to dominate financial markets and potentially larger areas of the economy.  
   The American Bankers Association, which has studied this very carefully, said:  
   [C]ommercial and banking should not be allowed to mix in the wholesale fashion permitted under the unitary thrift concept.......  
   The Independent Bankers Association of America said:  
   IBAA cannot support, and will oppose, any legislation that does not narrow the unitary thrift holding company loophole.  
   The Consumers Union said:  
   We oppose permitting federally-insured institutions to combine with commercial interests because of the potential to skew the availability of credit.......  
   I close by saying that a mixture of banking and commerce is widely considered to be a significant cause of the recent Asian economic crisis. As Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan testified last year before the Senate Banking Committee:  
   The Asia crisis has highlighted some of the risks that can arise if relationships between banks and commercial firms are too close.  
   Mr. President, I hope we will adopt this amendment. I think it strengthens  the overall bill. I certainly intend to support the bill and intend to support this amendment. I urge support of it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to join several of my colleagues in introducing the ``Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act,'' a bill designed to increase access to quality health care services in rural areas. I am pleased to have worked with my colleagues--Senators BAUCUS, ROBERTS, GRASSLEY, HARKIN, DASCHLE, CONRAD and COLLINS--in crafting this bill for rural America. 
   Rural health care has been a top priority for me throughout my service in the House and Senate. As co-chairman of the Senate Rural Health Care Caucus, I am pleased that rural health care is an issue that we have always addressed in a bipartisan way in the Senate. 
   Rural health care is at a crossroads. Many communities are left short-handed through no fault of their own. The lack of physicians, nurses and other health professionals make it difficult for rural individuals to receive the most basic primary care. Further, inadequate and, more importantly, unequal reimbursement by federal agencies multiplies these unique challenges and leaves rural individuals and families without access to vital medical care. 
   The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999 offers clear and sensible solutions to these problems. It increases reimbursement rates for rural hospitals and clinics, it offers communities additional assistance in recruiting physicians, it promotes the use of telemedicine services, it expands coverage of mental health services in rural areas and it ensures adequate representation of rural health care on a national Medicare advisory board. It is a long-term solution tailored to the needs of rural areas. 
   The bill incorporates many of the best ideas and recommendations that emerged from the Wyoming Health Care Policy Forum I hosted in Casper on August 26-27, 1998. Wyoming's health care providers, health care recipients, elected representatives and concerned citizens assembled to evaluate and assess the direction of Wyoming's health care delivery system and to chart a blueprint for its future. 
   This bill increases payments to Sole Community Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics and private health plans contracting with Medicare by exempting them from a proposed prospective payment system for outpatient hospital services. Facilities would be reimbursed on actual costs, providing a higher reimbursement rate. It would also update the cost reporting year, or ``rebase,'' the data Medicare uses to calculate costs and reimbursements. 
   Most hospitals in Wyoming are designated as Sole Community Hospitals because of isolation, weather, travel conditions and the absence of other health care facilities. They are crucial for health care delivery in Wyoming. 
   Further, the bill would expand the eligibility for hospitals to become Critical Access Hospitals. Critical Access Hospitals are a newly designated class of hospitals in rural areas that have been given greater flexibility and relief from federal regulations so they can organize their staff and facilities to meet the immediate emergency care needs of their small communities. They can tailor or reconfigure their services without losing their Medicare certification. 
   Rural communities through the United States are federally designated health professional shortage areas (HPSA). Wyoming has 22 of them. This means there is less than one primary care physician for every 3500 persons living in those areas. The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act helps solve this dilemma by offering effective solutions to recruit and retain health care providers. 
   It revises Medicare's Graduate Medical Education (GME) programs by raising the cap on the number of residents that will be allowed to participate in family practice residency programs. In addition, it provides added recruiting assistance to communities in HPSAs. Current law places rural communities at risk because it requires that a community first lose a physician before it qualifies for recruitment assistance. This bill recognizes pending physician resignations and retirements so communities have access to assistance before they lose their provider. 
   Further, it enhances the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) by giving tax relief to those receiving scholarships and loans under the program. The NHSC is an important component in the rural health care delivery system and additional tax relief would encourage recipients to remain in rural areas. 
   Telehealth technologies play a key role in bridging the barriers of time and distance that prevent access to medical care. We must ensure that the technology is practical, affordable, accessible and maintains privacy. The bill expands the types of telemedicine services that will be reimbursed under Medicare, which will be very useful in establishing a well-coordinated network of physicians, mid-level practitioners, hospitals and clinics. It also encourages solutions to telemedicine questions that have been raised about practicing interstate medicine by authorizing a Joint Working Group on Telehealth that would identify, monitor and coordinate federal telehealth projects and issue an annual report to Congress. 
   Mental health care is a priority in this bill. Individuals in rural areas often have limited access to mental health services. As a result, rural states license additional categories of mental health professionals than are recognized by Medicare. This bill ensures more of the services will be covered by Medicare. 
   Two years ago, Congress established the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to make important policy recommendations on Part A and Part B of the Medicare program. Unfortunately, of the current 15-member board, only  one health care professional is from a rural area. Our bill requires that the Commission include at least two representatives from Rural Areas. This will help ensure that the board members fully understand the implications of their policy decisions. 
   In conclusion, the Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act provides the answers many rural communities are looking for to ensure quality health care for their residents. I look forward to discussing and actively debating rural health this Congress. It is possible that Medicare reform legislation will be debated this year and the Senate Rural Health Care Caucus will work to attach many of these provisions to such legislation. We understand the impact recent Medicare changes are having on our nation's fragile rural health system. 
   We need to act now. This bill is a great start.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, clearly the discussions on Kosovo are dominating the day and should. But I hope that we don't forget that we do have an agenda that we need to go forward with as well. So I want to talk a few minutes today about Social Security. 
   Specifically, I would like to talk a little bit about our efforts to protect and strengthen the Social Security system. We have talked about it for a very long time. 
   It is not a surprise that without some changes, the Social Security program will not be able to accomplish what it is designed to accomplish. Nearly everyone recognizes that we have to do something different than we have been doing. I will, in fact, say that there is not a consensus as to what that ``something different'' ought to be. 
   But the goal surely can be shared by most everyone. The goal is to be able to know that we can continue to provide benefits for the beneficiaries and those that are close to being beneficiaries, and at the same time be able to provide benefits in the long run for young people who are now just beginning to have deducted from their salary Social Security payments. I suspect all of us want to do that. 
   I have a mother who I am concerned about who has Social Security. 
   I have 5-year-old twin grandchildren and I am anxious about their security. That is the kind of issue we have. 
   I notice today's newspaper expresses relief that we will go forward with Social Security. There was some discussion last week that it would not move. 
   I will talk a little bit about the lockbox legislation. We are seeking to push through a Social Security lockbox. What does that mean? It means we take that amount of money which comes in as Social Security now and set it aside so that it will be used for Social Security. 
   Over the years, we have had what is called a unified budget, and all the money that comes in--whether from Social Security, income tax, highway funds, or whatever--goes into the unified budget. 
   This year, for the first time in 25 years, we have had a balanced budget, but it is a unified budget. If you took Social Security out of that balanced budget, it would not be balanced. Indeed, it would be somewhat in deficit. 
   We need to understand what that is. Now that we are close to having a unified budget in balance and close to having it without Social Security, now we have an opportunity to do the things with Social Security dollars that I believe we need to do. 
   The lockbox is designed to guarantee that all Social Security surplus funds will be reserved for Social Security alone. This, of course, has not been the case. It is difficult to do, frankly. We have never had a place to put it. When we have a life insurance program or an annuity program, there has to be somewhere to put those funds so they draw interest. Of course, under the law, the only place they can be invested is in government securities. 
   They are set aside here, but they are spent. Of course the President is suggesting he would raid the Social Security to the tune of about $158 billion, after having talked for 2 years about saving Social Security. 
   I am concerned that the current debate is going to become very difficult: How do we pay for Kosovo? How do we pay for increasing the support of the military? How do we pay for the emergency funds that are in the process of being provided for Central America? 
   We have budget spending limits which I think are key to keeping a smaller Government, to keeping a responsible Government. When we go outside of those spending limits with emergency spending, it goes from Social Security. Last year, for example, the President insisted, with the threat of closing down Government, that we had to spend $20 billion in emergency funding. I suppose no one would argue if emergency funds are a genuine emergency, such as weather disasters or taking care of our troops in Kosovo, we are going to do that, by all means. When we start talking about how we build up the Armed Forces, I think we ought to take a look at whether that comes as an emergency or, in fact, comes out of our budget. 
   We are trying to move to some kind of financially sound lockbox. In 2014, Social Security begins to run in a deficit. Social Security started about 60 years ago, I think--in the 1930s. People paid 1 percent of $3,000--$30--into Social Security. There were 31 people working for every beneficiary. Of course, now that has changed. Now we all pay 12.5 percent of our earnings up to $70,000 or more, moving up. There are, I think, fewer than three people working for each one drawing 
   benefits. In the near future, it will be fewer than two. That is the sort of dilemma with which we are faced. 
   I suppose there are many considerations to look at, but there are three that are obvious. 
   One, you could reduce benefits. Not many are prepared to do that; even though Social Security, of course, is not a retirement program, it is a supplementary program. For a high percentage of people, that is, indeed, their largest income requirement. 
   Two, you could increase taxes. I don't think there is a great deal of excitement about that. I do not think it is a great idea. Social Security taxes are the largest tax that most Americans pay. 
   Three, increase the rate of return on the money that is in the trust fund.  That is one of the things we are talking about doing, trying to put together a personal account--not to take all of the 12 percent but to take, say, 3 or 4 percent out of the 12, about a third of the money. Let it be your account, your personal account. If, unfortunately, you were not able to live long enough to get all of your money out of it, it would go to your estate. 
   How is it invested? By private investors, similar to the Federal savings program. Once a year, members get a sheet of paper asking how they would like this invested. The choice would be in equities, bonds, or in a combination of the two. So members would choose one of those options. It is invested for you--not invested, as the President has suggested, where he takes trillions of dollars and has the Government invest it. Then the Government would basically control the marketplace. None of us want that. 
   Personal ownership, it seems to me, ensures that the Federal Government can't come back later and reduce your benefits. That is a way to secure those dollars. They are not then in the Government ready to be spent for some other reason. 
   Depending on your view about the size of government--and there is a legitimate difference between those who are more conservative and those who are more liberal. There are always ways to spend more money. To control the size of government, as has been our goal over the last number of years, you can't have a lot of surplus money lying around or else it is simply spent and government grows. We have to do something to secure Social Security. Then, hopefully, when there is excess money, we can look for some kind of tax relief. 
   It has been a long time since we started on this. Quite frankly, I think the sooner we make a change, the less abrupt that change will have to be. I am hopeful we do get back. We started out this year wanting to do this. Now the President is reluctant to take any leadership. Some of the leaders in the Congress were saying we ought to set it aside. I don't agree. 
   Certainly, we need to focus on Kosovo, but it doesn't mean we don't do the other things that are before the Senate. It is time to design a first-class system that fulfills the needs of everyone--our older citizens, our younger citizens. We need a permanent fix, not just tinkering around the edges. People have thought for years that Social Security was the holy grail of politics--touch it and you are dead. I think it has changed, because people understand if it is not changed, Social Security will be dead. 
   I hope we move forward.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this is really the ``No-Net-Gain'' bill that we have talked about before. The regulation is a commonsense proposal that will limit additional Federal land acquisition in public land States. The Federal Government continues to acquire more land throughout the Nation in every State of the Union, and folks are saying we have to take a new look at the growth of the Federal Government and begin to protect private property rights. This, however, only applies to States in which 25 percent or more of the State now belongs to the Federal Government. So, as you can imagine, the acquisition of additional lands is especially a problem for those of us living in the West. 
   Roughly 50 percent of the land in my home State of Wyoming is owned by the Federal Government. In some States it is as high as 87 percent--in Nevada. In Colorado, the home State of the Presiding Officer, it is higher than 50 percent. This bill deals with that sort of phenomenon. As you probably know, in the past, of course, much land was set aside in parks and forests. They were reserve lands. And I support that. I am glad they are set aside. These are national treasures and we want to keep them. 
   Much of the land, of course, was then put into private ownership through the Homestead Act. When that was concluded, there were still lands there that were left afterwards, and they were taken and are now managed by the Bureau of Land Management. These were not lands that were ever reserved; these were lands that were simply left over when the Homestead Act was completed. 
   So they, too, are managed for many uses and are important. This bill in no way asks these total lands be reduced. We are simply saying whenever there is an acquisition made for something that is useful--and it does allow the Federal Government to do that, of course--that an equal value of land, Federal land, be sent back into private ownership. 
   The Federal Government, of course, makes it a little more difficult sometimes in the States to have multiple use, to use them, to set them aside, to manage the environment, but at the same time have economic activities, to have mining, to have oil, to have timber, to have grazing. These are the things, of course, that are the lifeblood to the Western States. This creates often a hardship for the local economies; and it depresses the economy. 
   The Clinton administration, I think, has been particularly difficult in the way it has handled some of the public lands. The latest proposal, the Lands Legacy Initiative, is an example of a rather expansive acquisition of Federal lands. Again I say I have no objection to the maintaining of lands that have a special character, that have a special need, to be reserved into public ownership. All we say is, if you are going to do that, then release an equal value amount of lands back into private ownership. Many of us are very concerned about the Lands Legacy Initiative, that it will again impede the private ownership, which, of course, is a very basic thing to this whole country. 
   I think the time has come to put some kind of a bridle on the insatiable appetite for additional land in the western part of the United States. The No-Net-Loss of Private Lands Act is, I think, a reasonable approach to an ever-increasing growth of Federal land ownership. This measure requires the Federal Government to release an equal value of land when it acquires property in the States that are at least 25 percent federally owned.  
   The property would be released at the same time of the new acquisition and could be any type of Federal lands. In addition, the legislation would provide a provision waiving the disposal requirement in time of national emergency or war. 
   While in the Congress, both in the House and the Senate, I have worked extensively to protect unique public lands, such as national parks. I served as chairman of the National Parks Committee. I think there is nothing more important to us, in terms of preserving natural resources and cultural resources. 
   In fact, we passed a rather extensive bill called Vision 20/20 last year that does this. It helps to strengthen national parks. When I grew up, my parents' ranch bordered the Shoshone National Forest, so I feel very strongly about forests and that they should be there, but I do believe there needs to be some equality between the private ownership and Federal ownership. So it is time for the Congress to protect the rights of private owners and to instill some common sense and restraint in the further acquisition and growth of Federal lands. That is what this bill is designed to do. And I indicate the cosponsorship of Senator KYL and Senator HELMS.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will take a moment to talk a little bit about agriculture. 
   As the President knows, agriculture is a most important element in Wyoming's economy and to Wyoming's culture. During this past week, I had a chance to visit with many people in Wyoming who are very concerned about agriculture and agricultural markets or the lack thereof. So I want to talk a little bit about my vision of the things we are doing and can be  doing in Congress with respect to agriculture in this country. 
   Certainly our purpose ought to be to strengthen markets so the price for agricultural products is enhanced and so family farmers and family ranchers are able to make a reasonable return on their investment and on their time. 
   We have had a tough year in agriculture, in crops, and in livestock, and many of us have been working for some time to find some of the things that are appropriate for the Government to do to strengthen the agricultural sector. 
   One of them, of course, is trade and the idea of reducing the unilateral sanctions we have had in place around the world. Many times in the past, countries such as Pakistan, when they set off the bomb and so on, we immediately then did not trade with them. We have changed some of those unilateral sanctions. They are not useful for any other reason than to penalize our own markets. 
   We are pushing for stronger enforcement of trade agreements, particularly in NAFTA, for example, where we need to make sure that they are being administered properly, that goods are not being dumped, that goods are not coming in from another country through, in this case, the member of NAFTA that benefited 
   from that, and working to reduce unfair trade barriers which have existed and continue to exist around the world in interesting places, such as the European Union, where the President has just been. These are the kinds of things that seem to me to be totally unfair, where we open our markets to others and, in return, we have market barriers. 
   I am very pleased with what is happening with regard to the negotiations with China. I am not pleased with all the things that happen in China, of course, but in terms of the WTO negotiations, we find, for example, that we are going to make some arrangements to reduce the 40-percent to probably 10-percent tariff on our meat. That will be a very good forward move. 
   I am hopeful we can find a way to get the largest potential customer in the world into the WTO so that not only will it open markets but we do not have to deal unilaterally with someone; if we have an agreement, then there is the World Trade Organization to enforce those agreements. 
   We are talking about the tax relief for agriculture. We had income averaging last year, which is very good because the income of the farmers and ranchers varies very much. We have a proposition to have farm accounts which allow farmers to put the money into sort of an IRA for a period of time and draw it out before they pay taxes on it so that they tend to level out in income. 
   Estate tax relief: I hope that is one of the things we talk about when we deal with the tax reform--estate tax relief. Currently legislation is there to do that. 
   Meat labeling: I think we need to have, as we have proposed it here--and will again--meat labeling so that we know what the products are and so buyers, when they go to the grocery store, can determine whether the product is domestic. They need to have an opportunity to do that. 
   Also, grading: USDA grades are for domestic products, and will be used that way. Again, current legislation is pending. 
   One of the problems of the livestock industry has been, allegedly--and I agree with it--the concentration of packers. We have the latest figures, and I heard that about four packers kill about 87 percent of the product, which would cause you to think that there may be some legislation on pricing. And we need to do that. 
   We met with the Attorney General and asked that we, again, take a look at the potential of monopoly activities that may be there and do something about the concentration of packers. If they find again that there is nothing illegal being done, as they have in the past, it seems to me that we ought to take a look at the underlying legislation, the Packers and Stockyards Act, to see if, in fact, that needs to be changed. We need to have more competition. Things like owning the cattle, for example, and then using their own cattle instead of going into the market, which can manipulate the price--that fact, that there is buying without reporting the market price. That is something we need to do. 
   We are trying to change the inspections for interstate shipment of meat so that State inspections will suffice. We think that will help the market a great deal. 
   Certainly, in the crop area we need to look at NAFTA to make sure that there is not dumping of wheat and other products in this country. We need to take a look at the Crop Insurance Program, which I think has not worked that satisfactorily, to move the Freedom to Farm, and some of the things that are included in that. 
   Mr. President, I just think that there are a number of things that need to be done. We have some unique issues, of course, in the West where in a great many of our States--in my State of Wyoming 50 percent, and in the case of Nevada, 87 percent--the land belongs to the Federal Government. Much of the land is grazed. Livestock grazes on much of the land. We need to make that accessible so we can have multiple use of those renewable resources. We need to do something about the permit program so that they are not difficult. It isn't necessary, in my view, to have an environmental impact statement on every unchanged renewal of the grazing permits. 
   So these are some of the changes that need to be done. I don't think agriculture is looking for subsidies, or looking for a farm program. But they are looking for an opportunity to have the markets--an opportunity to go into the marketplace and get prices that are, in fact, reflective of the costs that go into 
   the product. 
   This is a basic industry to our country. There will be changes made, of course, as time goes by. There have been tremendous changes in agriculture over the last 50 years. The family farmers are getting larger. They are more mechanized and more efficient. They are also much more expensive. And much more investment is required. When you have a great deal of investment, of course, when you have several years of bad prices, it makes it very, very difficult, which also leads to the need probably for some additional lending capacity and some additional assistance in lending because of the 2 years that we have had. 
   So, Mr. President, I hope that as we come back in after this recess people will be more aware of the difficulty in agriculture, and that we can address ourselves to the many opportunities that we have to strengthen those markets and to provide more healthy and vigorous agriculture. 
   I thank you, Mr. President, for the time. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. I wanted to take an opportunity in morning business, Mr. President, to comment just a little bit on this whole business of budgeting; I guess more specifically, supplemental budgets and the problems that are there. 
   First of all, with respect to the budget that is before the Senate, I congratulate the leadership and the Appropriations Committee for the good work that they have done. I know that it is difficult. I think they have done a good job in seeking to offset the costs. 
   But I really believe that one of the things we need to change in the Senate is our method of budgeting, our method of supplemental budgeting particularly. First of all, in the broader sense, I am hopeful that we will consider this year the idea of a biennial budget, that we will come in at the beginning of the 2-year period, put down a budget, and have 2 years under which to operate so that in the second year we can do more of what we should be doing, and that is oversight of the expenditures of that budget. 
   I understand that under that circumstance there would be supplemental budgets, that you would probably be more likely to have one if you had the 2-year budget, but I think that is the thing we ought to be doing. Now we spend such a high percentage of our total time doing budgetary things and quite often bringing in things that are nonbudgetary on to budget bills. I think that is a mistake. 
   We are set up to have a Budget Committee. We are set up to have an Appropriations Committee that deals with the expenditures. We are set up to have committees of jurisdiction that are responsible for the policy. Unfortunately, many times 
   we find that issues on policy come to the appropriations, particularly on supplementals, without ever going to the committee of jurisdiction, and we find ourselves with policy on Appropriations Committee measures, which I think is inappropriate. 
   There again let me say, I congratulate those who have been involved with this bill, because I think they have done a good job--something around $2 billion, I believe, that has been generally offset. And I know how difficult it is to keep the amendments from coming. Everybody sees that as an opportunity to put on there the things they have been seeking to do. 
   We talk about having surpluses; we talk about what we are going to do with those surpluses. The real issue before us, particularly if you are interested in keeping the size of the Federal Government under control, is spending and spending caps. 
   I am pretty proud of what has happened here in the Senate, in the Congress, over the last several years, when we have been able to have some spending caps, and we have been able to at least hold spending at a relatively level. Yet we have a surplus, and we begin to think, ``Oh, we can do this.'' If you really want to keep control over the size of the Federal Government, if you really want to encourage governance to take place more at the State and local level, then we have to be very observant, I think, of spending caps. 
   There is a justification for emergency spending, certainly, when we have things like storms and earthquakes and so on, but emergency spending can also result in all kinds of things being called ``emergency spending,'' and the result is we spend more than our caps. 
   So I think most people in Wyoming believe that $1.6 trillion is plenty of money. That is what our spending is. In the natural event, we spent last year about $20 billion in emergency spending, much of which would be very hard to really honestly identify as emergency spending. It was an ``emergency'' way to have more spending, encouraged by the administration, encouraged by this President. And his budget is going to cause us to consider that even more, where the President has cut down spending that needs to go on, to put in new spending in the hopes that the total spending will be increased. 
   So, Mr. President, I just think that is the wrong way to go. I do, again, appreciate our chairman trying to hold and offset spending. I voted against the supplemental bill last year even though obviously there are always things there that you would like to have happen. 
   I think we need to look very closely at this bill to make sure that spending is in fact offset or that it is indeed emergency spending. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to share some general feelings about our budgeting system and to urge that we take a very close look at what we do in terms of our total spending and how it has been impacted by these kinds of supplemental budgets. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, I rise in opposition to the HUTCHINSON amendment and urge my colleagues to vote to table it. 
   I support China's accession to the WTO. I believe that it is in our own best interests to draw China further into the world community through fora such as the WTO. It will benefit the United States by creating a more-equal trade relationship between us, and will work to promote the rule of law in China. I also believe that it will benefit the United States by taking bilateral trade disputes which may pop up between us and making them multilateral, thereby minimizing the opportunity for those disputes to spill over and infect the rest of our relationship. 
   Of course, my support has an important caveat. China must accede on what are called ``commercially acceptable principles.'' China cannot accede as a developing country in some areas, and a developed country in others, leaving it to China to determine which are which. If the time comes for China's accession, Mr. President, you can be sure that if I am not convinced that the terms of China's accession are commercially acceptable, I will be the first Member to rush to this floor to oppose accession. 
   This amendment though, Mr. President, is not about the mechanics of accession to the WTO. Rather, it is yet another thinly-veiled attempt by its author--one in a long series of attempts--to single China out and punish it for offenses--real or imagined--committed in other spheres. Let me be clear: there is no argument that there aren't problems in our relationship with China, serious problems that we need to address. But there are more appropriate ways to address those problems. WTO accession is a trade issue. It is not a human rights issue. It is not a military issue. It is not a technology or nuclear transfer issue. It is not an issue about how China treats Taiwan or Hong Kong or Tibet. The issue should not be linked under the guise of a WTO debate; we should not turn a decision on WTO into a referendum on the immediate state of our overall bilateral relationship. 
   In addition, the sponsor makes a great deal of only wanting to pass this amendment in order to afford the Senate the opportunity to debate and then  vote on all the merits of China's accession should that time come. But Mr. President, we already have that opportunity. If and when China accedes to the WTO, that is not the end of the process. Congress still has to vote on extending permanent most-favored nation status to China. That debate will give the Senate, and the sponsor, ample opportunity to address all of the myriad issues surrounding China that he rightly feels are so important. It will give us a chance to raise concerns about human rights, military buildup, trade deficits, and all the rest. There is no need to afford ourselves the same opportunity twice. 
   In addition, Mr. President, requiring this second vote has no precedent. One hundred and ten countries have acceded to the WTO since 1948, and not once has the Senate required that we be afforded a separate vote on one of those accessions. But the Senator from Arkansas would like to single China out and set a different standard for that country's accession, to treat it differently than any other country that has come before it, or--presumably--would come after. I don't believe he can make a compelling case for doing so. Moreover, I am not convinced that giving ourselves veto authority in this manner over a trade agreement reached by the Executive Branch could pass constitutional muster. 
   For all these reasons, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment and support the motion to table of the Senator from Alaska.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, I come to the floor today because I believe that the time has come for a thoughtful and critical re-examination of United States policy towards the People's Republic of China. 
   There had been encouraging developments in China in the past two years. China has begun tackling the staggering job of reforming an antiquated command economy and opening it to private enterprise; and have begun to move the military out of the private sector. They've taken this difficult step even though they know it will result in the displacement and unemployment of literally millions of people. In addition, the government has greatly increased the number of democratic elections taking place at the village level throughout China. And Beijing has, for the most part, avoided interfering in Hong Kong affairs now that it is again a part of the PRC 
   But Mr. President, despite these improvements, I cannot ignore the fact that for every step China has taken forward, it appears to have also taken one or two back. And a bilateral relationship that 10 months ago looked as though it were showing improvement is instead, I believe, headed down a rocky road.

    Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join my colleague from Wyoming, Senator ENZI, in introducing legislation to convey certain BLM lands to the Westside Irrigation District. This measure is a culmination of years of hard work, by folks affected, to reach a solution through perseverance and much negotiation. It is a compromise--interested parties working together for a common goal, and it has been 30 years in the making. I am pleased today to be part of setting forth what is needed to turn a goal for many Wyoming residents into a reality. 
   This legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey roughly 37,000 acres of land under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management in Washakie County and Big Horn County, Wyoming, to the Westside Irrigation District. In turn, Westside Irrigation District will irrigate these lands and sell them as farmland parcels. Proceeds raised from the land sales will be given to the Secretary of the Interior for the acquisition of land in the Worland District of the Bureau of Land Management, for the purpose of benefiting public recreation, increasing public access, enhancing fish and wildlife habitat and improving cultural resources. 
   In recent years, expanded residential development in Washakie and Big Horn Counties has resulted in key loss to the economy--farmland. What this legislation proposes to do is afford communities an opportunity to retain their economic vitality while protecting cultural and natural resources. It promises to benefit both the business community and preserve the environment. 
   Benefits attained from this legislation will be fruitful for all parties. Agricultural producers have the rare chance to increase private land holdings in a largely public lands State. Wildlife interests are given the resources necessary to enhance critical habitat areas. In addition, the creation of 200 new jobs and an estimated financial impact of $16.8 million annually will spur tremendous economic development in these Wyoming counties. 
   Mr. President, let me once again congratulate all of the folks who have worked so hard on this measure--it is a job well done. I hope the Senate will give this bill every consideration and I look forward to taking action on it in the near future.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which would allow the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture to charge a fee when commercial filming activities take place on public lands in their jurisdiction. This legislation is another important part of our efforts to preserve and protect the pristine beauty of our national parks and other public lands. A similar version of this legislation was included in S. 1693, the Vision 2020, National Parks Restoration Act, when that bill passed the Senate. Unfortunately, the language was removed from that bill when it passed the House of Representatives. 
   The purpose of this measure is very simple. When commercial film companies use our nation's public lands, they should pay for that privilege. Our nation's parks and other lands provide an outstanding backdrop for the commercial film industry and we should ensure that these areas are not negatively impacted by that use. 
   This legislation is not designed as a ``bash Hollywood'' bill. I want to comment the commercial film industry for their efforts to work with me and other members of Congress to find a reasonable solution to this matter. Although there are those in the industry who do not want to pay for the use of these lands, by and large the film industry is willing to pay a fee for filming on public lands as long as it is reasonable, understandable and fair. I believe the bill I am introducing today meets all of those criteria. 
   Let me take a few moments to outline this measure. The legislation  would authorize both the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture to charge a reasonable fee for commercial filming activities on federal lands in their jurisdiction. The fee will be based on a number of criteria including; the number of days the filming takes place within the areas, the size of the film crew and the amount and type of equipment used. The agencies would also be directed to recover any costs incurred as a result of filming activities such as administrative and personnel costs. All of the fees charged for film activities would stay at the site where they are collected. 
   We have also included language in this bill to address the issue of still photography on public lands. As we worked to craft the parks bill last year, we heard from a large number of still photographers who were worried about the impact this legislation would have on them. In order to address those concerns, we have included language in our bill exempting still photography unless the agency determines that this activity will disrupt the public's use and enjoyment of the resource. I believe this is a fair way to address this question. 
   Mr. President, the time has come to establish a film fee system on our nation's public lands that is sensible and understandable. Once again, I want to stress that this bill is not designed to punish the film industry. Instead, this measure will benefit both the public and the film industry by establishing simple and understandable system for operating on federal lands. Establishing a sound fee system for filming on public lands can be a ``win-win'' for the public and the film industry and I hope the Senate will take quick action on this important measure.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Electric Utility Restructuring Empowerment and Competitiveness Act of 1999. This legislation empowers the states to restructure their electric industries at the rate and in the way they decide. My legislation imposes no ``retail choice mandate'' or deadline on the States so as to fully allow the best market ideas and approaches to occur. As well, EURECA removes Federal impediments to competition and deregulates and streamlines the industry. 
   My bill gives the States the leading role in implementing competition in the electric power industry. This approach contrasts with the bills introduced in the House and Senate last Congress that required competition nationwide by a date certain. A Federal mandate on the States requiring retail competition by a date certain is not in the best interest of all classes of consumers. I am concerned such an approach would cause increased prices for low density States with relatively low cost power. This bill will protect States' rights and allow States maximum latitude to adapt competition to their own individual needs. 
   I believe States are in the best position to deal with this complex issue. Although the cost of electricity varies across the country, electric industry restructuring can result in lower consumer prices for everyday goods and services, the development of innovative new products and services, and a growing, more productive economy. 
   We have spent the last two Congresses holding hearings to review the state of competition in the electric power industry and discussing numerous pieces of legislation dealing with restructuring. Meanwhile, 20 individual States have passed their own legislation introducing competition into the retail electric industry and many other States are considering such proposals. According to industry statistics, nearly 50 percent of all Americans now live in States committed to retail competition. States are clearly taking the lead--they should continue to have that role--and this bill encourages more innovation by affirming States' ability to implement retail choice policies. 
   It is critical to the welfare of the States that each one have an opportunity to ready and equip themselves for a successful transition to a deregulated environment. By learning from the States 
   which have already implemented competition, other states can take precautions and adopt laws that will best protect them as they adjust to this new competitive environment. With FERC's Order 888, which created competitive wholesale power supply markets through the availability of non-discriminatory open-access transmission service under tariff, we have seen at both the State and Federal levels that we are now in a critical testing period in the implementation of market-based policies. Specifically, we saw the price spikes that occurred last summer in the Midwest. After holding a hearing on the subject, the experts agreed that we are indeed in a transition period. Although no one could point to one specific reason for the occurrence, and many were suggested, all seemed to agree for the need of national reliability standards. 
   Traditionally, reliability of the transmission system was managed by a voluntary, industry-led organization known as the North American Electric Reliability Council. We have added many new players to the transmission grid, making for an increasingly decentralized and competitive U.S. electricity industry. And, as determined by a recently issued DOE Task Force Report, ``the old institutions of reliability are no longer sufficient.'' I have added a section on reliability to my legislation. The industry collectively came up with a legislative proposal that would transform NERC from a voluntary system of reliability management to NAERO, an organization that is mandatory in nature and subject to FERC oversight. Sustaining system reliability is crucial for protecting all classes of consumers and such an organization can help ensure that power markets function efficiently. 
   One of the most important aspects of this debate--assuring that universal service is maintained--is a critical function that each state PUC should have the ability to oversee and enforce. In my legislation, nothing would prohibit a state from requiring all electricity providers that sell electricity to retail customers in that state to provide electricity service to all classes and consumers of electric power. All classes of consumers should have access to adequate, safe, reliable and efficient energy services at fair and reasonable prices, as a result of competition. 
   Mr. President, my proposal will create greater competition at the wholesale level by prospectively deregulating wholesale sales of electricity. We did this in natural gas and it worked--I am confident it will work in electricity. Although everyone talks about ``deregulating'' the electricity industry, it is really the generation segment that will be deregulated. The FERC will continue to regulate transmission in interstate commerce, and State PUCs will continue to regulate retail distribution services and sales. 
   When FERC issued Order 888, it allowed utilities to seek market-based rates for new generating capacity. This provision goes a step further and allows utilities to purchase wholesale power from existing generation facilities, after the date of enactment of this Act, at prices solely determined by market forces. 
   Furthermore, the measure expands FERC authority to require non-public utilities that own, operate or control transmission to open their systems. Currently, the Commission cannot require the Power Marketing Administration (PMAs), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), municipalities and cooperatives which own transmission to provide wholesale open access transmission service. Since approximately 22 percent of all transmission is beyond open access 
   authority, requiring these non-public utilities to provide this service will help ensure that a true wholesale power market exists. 
   One of the key elements of this measure is streamlining and modernizing the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). While both of these initiatives were enacted with good intentions, there is widespread belief that the Acts have fulfilled their original obligations and have outlived their usefulness. 
   My bill amends Section 210 of PURPA on a prospective basis. Current PURPA contracts would continue to be honored and upheld. However, upon enactment of this legislation, a utility  that begins operating would not be required to enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase electricity under Section 210 of PURPA. 
   With regard to PUHCA, I've included Senators SHELBY's and DODD's ``Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1999.'' This language is identical to the bipartisan legislation reported by the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in the 105th Congress. Under this proposal, PUHCA would be repealed. Furthermore, all books and records of each holding company and each associate company would be transferred to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)--which currently has jurisdiction over the 19 registered holding companies--to FERC. This allows energy regulators, who truly know the industry to oversee the operations of these companies and review acquisitions and mergers. These consumer protections are an important part of PUHCA reform. 
   Mr. President, an issue that must be resolved in order for a true competitive environment to exist is that of utilities receiving ``subsidies'' by the federal government and the U.S. tax code. For years, investor owned utilities (IOUs) have claimed inequity because of tax-exempt financing and low-interest loans that municipalities and rural cooperative receive. On the other side of the equation, these public power systems maintain that IOUs receive benefits in the tax code such as accelerated depreciation, investment tax credits and deferred income tax and many use tax-exempt debt for pollution control bonds. Are these in a way, ``subsidies?'' The jury is still out on how best to tackle these difficult issues but without a doubt, we will need to come to a resolution. 
   Finally, my bill directs the Inspector General of the Department of the Treasury to file a report to the Congress detailing whether and how tax code incentives received by all utilities should be reviewed in order to foster a competitive retail electricity market in the future. 
   Mr. President, with respect to federal comprehensive restructuring legislation, it is the states themselves that hold the key to ultimate success. EURECA allows states to continue to move forward and craft electricity proposals that best fit their own particular needs. This legislation is the best solution to move forward with a better product for all classes of consumers and the industry as a whole.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, I rise in begrudging support for S. Res. 45. I say begrudging only because while I agree that the UN Human Rights Commission should address China's human rights record, I neither believe that the UNHRC will place the issue on its agenda nor do I feel that this resolution has been brought to the floor in the most constructive manner. 
   I agree with the other Senators who have spoken this morning that there has been a disturbing increase in China in the last six months in crackdowns on the freedom of expression, crackdowns evidenced by an increase in the number of arrests and convictions of prodemocracy activists. Moreover, despite attempts to establish a dialog with Beijing, China still refuses to meet with His Holiness the Dalai Lama to discuss the future of Tibet and instead continues to facilitate the increasing immigration of Han Chinese into Tibet and the jailing of Buddhist nuns and lamas. Christian churches not registered with the central government continue to be subject to harassment and closure and their congregants subject to arrest. 
   I believe I understand, although I certainly in no way condone, the impetus behind the crackdown. China has recently embarked on a program to restructure its economy to a market-oriented system and to open more to the world around it. These changes are obviously potentially destabilizing for a communist regime governing 1.3 billion people. And as with other campaigns in China's past designed to restructure society, such as the ``Let 100 Flowers Bloom'' campaign, once the program took hold and began to accelerate, the central authorities got anxious about continuing to be able to control the pace of reform and about it getting out from underneath them. They have consequently begun slamming on the brakes and stifling any perceived dissent. And it is that movement to stifle peaceful dissent and universal human freedoms that should prompt the US to press this issue before the UNHRC. 
   In a perfect world one would think that these are exactly the type of actions the UNHRC would want to address, but sadly we all know the reality of the eventual outcome. This year, as in years past, the United States will fail by a significantly wide vote margin to place China on the Commission's agenda. We will be deserted by most of our purported allies who, while nominally paying lip service to the sanctity of human rights, appear more interested in securing their commercial interests in the PRC. Well Mr. President, so be it. As Senator BIDEN has noted, there is no shame in standing alone on the right side of history, and I fully support that stand under the conditions prevailing in China this year. 
   But Mr. President, while I support the consideration of this resolution today, I am less enthused about the terms of the unanimous consent agreement which brought it here. As the Chairman of the subcommittee of jurisdiction, in past Congresses I have strongly disfavored the practice of discharging the Foreign Relations Committee from the consideration of legislation which the Committee has not had the opportunity to address first. My disapproval of discharges is especially acute when the legislation in question is sponsored by a Senator not a member of the Committee. I intend this to be my practice in this Congress as well. 
   I have, however, made exceptions in the case of legislation which is completely non-controversial or is somehow time-sensitive. Since the UNHRC meetings this year in Geneva are imminent, and since there was not enough time to consider the legislation  in Committee, it made sense in this narrow case and for those reasons I agreed to the discharge. 
   I am also uneasy with the terms of the unanimous consent agreement because they preclude any amendment to the resolution, thereby preventing members from offering what I feel would be constructive changes to the text. In addition, Mr. President, I am unsure why--when the Senate should be focused on more pressing domestic issues such as the Y2K problem or Social Security--we are taking the Senate's time to debate and then vote on a resolution about which there is no difference of opinion and which will most likely pass 100 to 0. This could have just as easily been disposed of by unanimous consent yesterday. For those that argue that a unanimous roll call vote somehow sends a stronger signal than passing legislation by unanimous consent, I would note that it is my longstanding experience that very few people if any outside the Beltway--especially in foreign countries--understand the nuanced differences between the two.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which was passed by the Senate during the 105th Congress and unfortunately was not passed by the House of Representatives. This measure, which would return a family farm in Big Horn County, WY, to its rightful owners, has also gained the Administration's full support. 
   The family of Fred Steffens lost ownership of the property where they lived and prospered for almost 70 years, as a result of a misrepresentation by the original property owners. Mr. Steffens' relatives have explored every avenue to regain the title to their property, and are left with no other option than to seek congressional assistance. I stand before you today, on behalf of my constituents, to request help in providing a timely solution to this problem. It is my hope that in doing so, this wrong can be righted. 
   Upon the death of Fred Steffens on January 20, 1995, his sister Marie Wambeke was appointed personal representative of the 80-acre Steffens Estate. In February 1996, Ms. Wambeke learned from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) that she did not have a clear title to her brother's property, and she submitted a Color-of-Title application. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Wambeke was informed that her brother's property was never patented, so her application was rejected. 
   The injustice of this situation is that when Mr. Steffens purchased this property in 1928, he did receive a Warranty Deed with Release of Homestead from the former owners. Unfortunately, these individuals did not have a reclamation entry to assign to Mr. Steffens. In fact, 2 years before selling the property, the original owners had been informed that the land they occupied was withdrawn by the Bureau of Reclamation for the Shoshone Reclamation Project. At the same time, they were notified that they had never truly owned the property. 
   Unethically, this did not stop them from selling the land to Mr. Steffens in 1928. In good faith Mr. Steffens purchased the property, paid taxes on the property from the time of purchase, and is on record at the Big Horn County Assessor's office as owner of this property. Due to the dishonesty of others, his family now faces the sobering reality of losing this land unless a title transfer can be effected legislatively. 
   Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today would transfer the land from Fred Steffens' Estate to his sister Marie. This property has been in their family since 1928. Through no fault of their own, these folks are being forced to relinquish rights not only to their land, but to a part of their heritage and a legacy to their future generations. I hope we can expedite this matter by turning this land over the Marie Wambeke's ownership.

    Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce S. 404, a bill to prohibit the return to a foreign country of any portion of a memorial to American veterans without the express authorization of Congress. The bill is identical to S. 1903 which I introduced at the end of the last Congress. 
   I would not have thought that a bill like this was necessary, Mr. President. It would never have occurred to me that an Administration would even briefly consider dismantling part of a memorial to American soldiers who died in the line of duty in order to send a piece of that memorial to a foreign country; but a real possibility of just that happening exists in my state of Wyoming involving what are known as the ``Bells of Balangiga.'' 
   In 1898, the Treaty of Paris brought to a close the Spanish-American War. As part of the treaty, Spain ceded possession of the Philippines to the United States. At about the same time, the Filipino people began an insurrection in their country. In August 1901, as part of the American effort to stem the insurrection, a company of 74 officers and men from the 9th Infantry, Company G, occupied the town of Balangiga on the island of Samar. These men came from Ft. Russell in Cheyenne, Wyoming--today's F.E. Warren Air Force Base. 
   On September 28 of that year, taking advantage of the preoccupation of the American troops with a church service for the just-assassinated President McKinley, a group of Filipino insurgents infiltrated the town. Only three American sentries were on duty that day. As described in an article in the November 19, 1997 edition of the Wall Street Journal:  
   Officers slept in, and enlisted men didn't bother to carry their rifes as they ambled out of their quarters for breakfast. Balangiga had been a boringly peaceful site since the infantry company arrived a month earlier, according to military accounts and soldiers' statements. The quiet ended abrupty when a 23 year old U.S. sentry named Adolph Gamlin walked past the local police chief. In one swift move, the Filipino grabbed the slightly built Iowan's rifle and smashed the butt across [Gamlin's] head. As PFC Gamlin crumpled, the bells of Balangiga began to peal. 
   With the signal, hundreds of Filipino fighters swarmed out of the surrounding forest, armed with clubs, picks and machete-like bolo knives. Others poured out of the church; they had arrived the night before, disguised as women mourners and carrying coffins filled with bolos. A sergeant was beheaded in  the mess tent and dumped into a vat of steaming wash water. A young bugler was cut down in a nearby stream. The company commander was hacked to death after jumping out a window. Besieged infantrymen defended themselves with kitchen forks, mess kits and baseball bats. Others threw rocks and cans of beans. 
   Though he was also slashed across the back, PFC.......Gamlin came to and found a rifle. By the time he and the other survivors fought their way to the beach, 38 US soldiers were dead and all but six of the remaining men had been wounded.  
   The remaining soldiers escaped in five dug-out canoes. Only three boats made it to safety on Leyte. Seven men died of exposure at sea, and another eight died of their wounds; only 20 of the company's 74 members survived. 
   A detachment of 54 volunteers from 9th infantry units stationed at Leyte returned to Balangiga and recaptured the village. They were reinforced a few days later from Companies K and L of the 11th Infantry Regiment. When the 11th Infantry was relieved on October 18, by Marines, the 9th Infantry took two of the church bells and an old cannon with them back to Wyoming as memorials to the fallen soldiers. 
   The bells and cannon have been displayed in front of the base flagpole on the central parade grounds since that time. The cannon was restored by local volunteers and placed under a glass display case in 1985 to protect it from the elements. The bells were placed in openings in a large specially constructed masonry wall with a plaque dedicating the memorial to the memory of the fallen soldiers. 
   Off and on since 1981, there have been some discussions in various circles in Cheyenne, Washington, and Manila about the future of the bells, including the possibility of returning them to the Philippines. Most recently, the Philippine government--having run into broad opposition to their request to have both bells returned to them--has proposed making a copy of both bells, and having both sides keep one copy and one original. Opposition to the proposal from local and national civic and veterans groups has been very strong. 
   Last year, developments indicated to me that the White House was seriously contemplating returning one or both of the bells to the Philippines. 1998 marked the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Paris, and a state visit by then-President Fidel Ramos--his last as President--to the United States. The disposition of the bells was high on President Ramos' agenda; he has spoken personally to President Clinton and several members of Congress about it over the last three years, and made it one of only three agenda items the Filipino delegation brought to the table. Since January 1998, the Filipino press has included almost weekly articles on the bells' supposed return, including several in the Manila Times in April and May which reported that a new tower to house the bells was being constructed in Borongon, Samar, to receive them in May. In addition, there have been a variety of reports vilifying me and the veterans in Wyoming for our position on the issue, and others threatening economic boycotts of US products or other unspecified acts of retaliation to force capitulation on the issue. 
   Moreover, inquiries to me from various agencies of the Administration soliciting the opinion of the Wyoming congressional delegation on the issue increased in frequency in the first four months of 1998. I also learned that the Defense Department, perhaps in conjunction with the Justice Department, prepared a legal memorandum outlining its opinion of who actually controls the disposition of the bells. 
   In response, the Wyoming congressional delegation wrote a letter to President Clinton on January 9, 1998, to make clear our opposition to removing the bells. In response to that letter, on May 
   26 I received a letter from Sandy Berger of the National Security Council which I think is perhaps one of the best indicators of the direction the White House was headed on this issue. 
   To head off any move by the Administration to dispose of the bells, I and Senator ENZI introduced S. 1903 on April 1. The bill had 18 cosponsors, including the distinguished Chairmen of the Committees on Armed Services, Foreign Relations, Finance, Energy and Natural Resources, Rules, Ethics, and Banking; the Chairmen of five Subcommittees of the Foreign Relations Committee; and five members of the Armed Services Committee. 
   Mr. President, at this point let me dispose of a canard that was forwarded shortly after the time I introduced S. 1903 by those seeking the return of the bells. They asserted that the bill was actually in contravention of the wishes of the people of the State of Wyoming because the Wyoming Legislature, quoting a letter from the Ambassador of the Philippines dated April 3, 1998, ``supports the sharing of the bells.'' That statement, however, glosses over the real facts. 
   Wyoming's legislature is not a ``professional'' one--that is, the legislators have other, full-time jobs and the Legislature only sits for forty days at the beginning of each year and twenty days in the fall. When the Legislature meets, it is often to process an entire year's worth of legislation in just a few weeks. 
   Like Congress, the Wyoming Legislature has a formal process of introducing, considering, and then voting on bills which become law upon the signature of the chief executive--in this case the governor. Also like Congress, the Legislature has a system for expressing its non-binding viewpoint on certain issues through resolutions. But unlike Congress, the Legislature also has an informal resolution process to express the viewpoint of only a given number of legislators, as opposed to the entire legislative body, on a given topic; the vehicle for such a process is called a ``joint resolution.'' 
   In this process, a legislator circulates the equivalent of a petition among his or her colleagues. Support for the subject matter is signified simply by signing one's name to the petition. Once the sponsor has acquired all the signatures he or she can--or wishes to--acquire, the joint resolution is simply deposited for the record with the Office of the Governor; it is never--I repeat never--voted on in either House of the Legislature, nor is it signed by the governor. As a consequence, it is not considered to be the position of, or the expression of the will of, the Legislature as a whole, but only of those legislators who signed it. 
   Although the bells are an issue of interest among some circles state-wide, the issue is not well-known all over Wyoming. I have heard from several of the signatories of the joint resolution on the bells that they were not aware of the circumstances surrounding the bells at the time they signed the joint resolution. In this regard, it is important to note that the sponsor of the joint resolution did not enlighten them about the role of the bells in the unprovoked killing of 54 American soldiers in Balangiga before they signed the document. Moreover, that fact was completely and purposefully left out of the wording of the joint resolution itself; the death of these American soldiers was completely glossed over. The closest the joint resolution gets to mentioning the surprise attack and resulting deaths is this, which I quote verbatim:  
   Whereas, at a point in the relationship, nearly one hundred (100) years ago following the Spanish-American War, armed conflict occurred between the United States and the Philippines; and 
   Whereas, a particularly noteworthy incident occurred on the island of Samar in 1901 during the course of that conflict; and 
   Whereas, that incident involved the ringing of the Church Bells of Balangiga on Samar to signal the outbreak of fighting.  
   Imagine. The author of the joint resolution reduced the surprise attack and horrible deaths of fifty-four soldiers to a seemingly innocent, benign ``noteworthy incident.'' So while some may rely on the joint resolution as though it were the ``voice of Wyoming'' in support of their position, an examination of the actual facts surrounding it proves that reliance to be very misplaced. 
   While time has passed since this issue came to a head last April, Mr. President, my deep concern that the Administration might still dispose of the bells has not. The Administration has not disavowed its earlier intent to seek to return the bells--an intent derailed by the introduction of S. 1903 last year. In addition, despite Article IV, section 3, clause 2 of the Constitution, which states that the ``Congress shall have the power to dispose of ..... Property belonging to the United States,'' the Justice Department has issued an informal memorandum stating that the Bells could possibly be disposed of by the President pursuant to the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &#167;2572.  
   I continue to be amazed, even in these days of political correctness and revisionist history, that a U.S. President--our Commander-in-Chief--would appear to be ready to ignore the wishes of our veterans and tear down a memorial to U.S. soldiers who died in the line of duty in order to send part of it back to the country in which they were killed. Amazed, that is, until I recall this President's fondness for sweeping apologies and what some might view as flashy P.R. gestures. Consequently, Senator ENZI and I have decided to reintroduce the bill in the 106th Congress. 
   Mr. President, to the veterans of Wyoming, and the United States as a whole, the bells represent a lasting memorial to those fifty-four American soldiers killed as a result of an unprovoked insurgent attack in Balangiga on September 28, 1901. In their view, which I share, any attempt to remove either or both of the bells--and in doing so actually physically dismantling a war memorial--is a desecration of that memory.

   Opposition to the proposal from local and national civic and veterans groups has been very strong. Mr. President, I will include in the RECORD the text of a letter from the national office of the American Legion dated April 8, 1998; from the national office of the VFW Dated January 6, 1998 from the American Legion's Department of Wyoming dated December 5, 1997; and from the United Veterans Council of Wyoming dated March 13, 1998. 
   To head off any move by the Administration to dispose of the bells, I and Senator ENZI introduced S. 1903 on April 1. The bill had 18 cosponsors, including the distinguished Chairmen of the Committees on Armed Services, Foreign Relations, Finance, Energy and Natural Resources, Rules, Ethics, and Banking; the Chairmen of five Subcommittees of the Foreign Relations Committee; and five members of the Armed Services Committee.

   Wyoming's legislature is not a ``professional'' one--that is, the legislators have other, full-time jobs and the Legislature only sits for forty days at the beginning of each year and twenty days in the fall. When the Legislature meets, it is often to process an entire year's worth of legislation in just a few weeks. 
   Like Congress, the Wyoming Legislature has a formal process of introducing, considering, and then voting on bills which become law upon the signature of the chief executive--in this case the governor. Also like Congress, the Legislature has a system for expressing its non-binding viewpoint on certain issues through resolutions. But unlike Congress, the Legislature also has an informal resolution process to express the viewpoint of only a given number of legislators, as opposed to the entire legislative body, on a given topic; the vehicle for such a process is called a ``joint resolution.'' 
   In this process, a legislator circulates the equivalent of a petition among his or her colleagues. Support for the subject matter is signified simply by signing one's name to the petition. Once the sponsor has acquired all the signatures he or she can--or wishes to--acquire, the joint resolution is simply deposited for the record with the Office of the Governor; it is never--I repeat never--voted on in either House of the Legislature, nor is it signed by the governor. As a consequence, it is not considered to be the position of, or the expression of the will of, the Legislature as a whole, but only of those legislators who signed it. 
   Although the Bells are an issue of interest among some circles state-wide, the issue is not well-known all over Wyoming. I have heard from several of the signatories of the joint resolution on the bells that they were not aware of the circumstances surrounding the bells at the time they signed the joint resolution. In this regard, it is important to note that the sponsor of the joint resolution did not enlighten them about the role of the bells in the unprovoked killing of 54 American soldiers in Balangiga before they signed the document. Moreover, that fact was completely and purposefully left out of the wording of the joint resolution itself; the death of these American soldiers was completely glossed over. The closest the joint resolution gets to mentioning the surprise attack and resulting deaths is this, which I quote verbatim:  
   Whereas, at a point in the relationship, nearly one hundred (100) years ago following the Spanish-American War, armed conflict occurred between the United States and the Philippines; and 
   Whereas, a particularly noteworthy incident occurred on the island of Samar in 1901 during the course of that conflict; and 
   Whereas, that incident involved the ringing of the Church Bells of Balangiga on Samar to signal the outbreak of fighting.  
   Imagine. The author of the joint resolution reduced the surprise attack and horrible deaths of fifty-four soldiers to a seemingly innocent, benign ``noteworthy incident.'' So while some may rely the joint resolution as though it were the ``voice of Wyoming'' in support of their position, an examination of the actual facts surrounding it proves that reliance to be very misplaced. 
   While time has passed since this issue came to a head last April, Mr. President, my deep concern that the Administration might still dispose of the bells has not. The Administration has not disavowed its earlier intent to seek to return the bells--an intent derailed by the introduction of S. 1903 last year. In addition, despite Article IV, section 3, clause 2 of the Constitution, which states that the ``Congress shall have the power to dispose of ..... Property belonging to the United States,'' the Justice Department has issued an informal memorandum stating that the Bells could possibly be disposed of by the President pursuant to the provisions of 10 U.S.C. &#167;2572. 
   I continue to be amazed, even in these days of political correctness and revisionist history, that a U.S. President--our Commander-in-Chief--would appear to be ready to ignore the wishes of our veterans and tear down a memorial to U.S. soldiers who died in the  line of duty in order to send part of it back to the country in which they were killed. Amazed, that is, until I recall this President's fondness for sweeping apologies and what some might view as flashy P.R. gestures. Consequently, Senator ENZI and I have decided to reintroduce the bill in the 106th Congress. 
   Mr. President, to the veterans of Wyoming, and the United States as a whole, the bells represent a lasting memorial to those fifty-four American soldiers killed as a result of an unprovoked insurgent attack in Balangiga on September 28, 1901. In their view, which I share, any attempt to remove either or both of the bells--and in doing so actually physically dismantling a war memorial--is a desecration of that memory.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have been listening with great attention to what we are talking about. Certainly, there is nothing more important before us now than the budget. We have heard all kinds of explanations, and we will hear many more. We will argue about the allocation over time. But it seems to me, as I think about it, that the idea of a budget is where we really set our priorities. 
   There is more to a budget than simply the question of where we spend every dollar. What we do with the budget is, we put into reality the things we would like to see in our Government. What size Government would you like to have? What do we do with respect to our working with the State and local governments? How does that fit? What do we do about taxes? Is there 
   something we want to do there? I look at it as really an opportunity for us to, philosophically and from an ideal standpoint, look at why we are here and what it is we want to accomplish. 
   For those who want a simpler and smaller Government, does this budget do that? I don't think so. This is an increase in size. This is more Government. This is larger. 
   What if your goal was really to move more and more of the choices and more and more of the responsibility closer to people and State and local governments? Does this budget do that? No, I don't think so. 
   What if you want to really feel strongly about spending caps and say that this is the way you control spending? Does this budget stay with the caps that we argued so much about just 2 years ago? No, it doesn't do that. 
   If you had an idea that you would really like to take care of paying down this debt on a dependable program over a period of time, a little bit like, I suppose, a mortgage, and you wanted to do that, does this do that? No, it doesn't. 
   So I hope that as we go through this whole process--and it will be, unfortunately, almost all of the year--I hope we start with the principles that we would like to see enunciated when we are through. We will have different views. Some people want more Government, more spending and more taxes--a legitimate idea, but not one that I share. I think we do much of that in the budget. 
   So I hope, Mr. President, that we really take a look at measuring this budget in terms of our values, the reason we came here, the reason we have given to our constituents as to why we  are here. Much of it will be reflected in this budget. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators NICKLES, CRAIG, HELMS, CRAPO, GRAMS, and ENZI, to introduce the State and Local Government Participation Act of 1999 which would amend the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This bill is designed to guarantee that federal agencies identify state, county and local governments as cooperating agencies when fulfilling their environmental planning responsibilities under NEPA. 
   NEPA was designed to ensure that the environmental impacts of a proposed federal action are considered and minimized by the federal agency taking that action. It was supposed to provide for adequate public participation in the decision making process on these federal activities and document an agency's final conclusions with respect to the proposed action. 
   Although this sounds simple and quite reasonable, NEPA has become a real problem in Wyoming and many states throughout the nation. A statute that was supposed to provide for additional public input in the federal land management process has instead become an unworkable and cumbersome law. Instead of clarifying and expediting the public planning process on federal lands, NEPA now serves to delay action and shut-out local governments that depend on the proper use of these federal lands for their existence. 
   The State and Local Government Participation Act is designed to provide for greater input from state and local governments in the NEPA process. This measure would simply guarantee that state, county and local agencies be identified as cooperating entities when preparing land management plans under NEPA. Although the law already provides for voluntary inclusion of state and local entities in the planning process, to often, the federal agencies choose to ignore local governments when preparing planning documents under NEPA. Unfortunately, many federal agencies have become so engrossed in examining every environmental aspect of a proposed action on federal land, they have forgotten to consult with the folks who actually live near and depend on these areas for their economic survival. 
   Mr. President, states and local communities must be consulted and included when proposed actions are being taken on federal lands in their state. Too often, federal land managers are more concerned about the comments of environmental organizations located in Washington, D.C. or New York City than the people who actually live in the state where the proposed action will take place. This is wrong. The concerns, comments and input of state and local communities is vital for the proper management of federal lands in the West. The State and Local Government Participation Act of 1999 will begin to address this troubling problem and guarantee that local folks will be involved in proposed decision that will affect their lives.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise as chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to introduce S. 354, a bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment--formerly known as ``most-favored nation status''--to the products of Mongolia. I am pleased to be joined by Senator MCCAIN, chairman of the Commerce Committee; Senator KERRY, the ranking minority member of my subcommittee; and Senator ROBB and Senator SMITH or Oregon as original cosponsors. 
   Mongolia has undergone a series of remarkable and dramatic changes over the last few years. Sandwiched between the former Soviet Union and China, it was one of the first countries in the world to become communist after the Russian Revolution. After 70 years of communist rule, though, the Mongolian people have recently made great progress in establishing a democratic political system and creating a free-market economy. Since that time, there have been successive successful national and regional elections. 
   Mongolia has demonstrated a strong desire to build a friendly and cooperative relationship with the United States on trade and related matters since its turn towards democracy. We concluded a bilateral trade treaty with that country in 1991, and a bilateral investment treaty in 1994. Mongolia has received nondiscriminatory trading status since 1991, and has been found to be in full compliance with the freedom of emigration requirements of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974. In additions, it has acceded to the Agreement Establishing of the World Trade Organization. 
   Mr. President, Mongolia has clearly demonstrated that it is fully deserving of joining the ranks of those countries to which we extend nondiscriminatory trade status. The extension of that status would not only serve to commend the Mongolians on their impressive progress, but would also enable the U.S. to avail itself of all its rights under the WTO with respect to Mongolia. 
   I have another, more parochial, reason for being interested in MFN status for Mongolia. Mongolia and my home state of Wyoming are sister states; a strong relationship between the two has developed over the last four years. Many of Mongolia's provincial governors have visited the state, and the two governments have established partnerships in education, agriculture, and livestock management. Like Wyoming, Mongolia is a high plateau with mountains on the northwest border, where many of the residents make their living by raising livestock. I am pleased to see the development of this mutually beneficial relationship, and am sure that the extension of nondiscriminatory trade status will serve to strengthen it further. 
   Mr. President, I introduced an identical bill in the last Congress, but Congress adjourned sine die before the bill could be acted on by both houses. I was very appreciative that last year the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, indicated his willingness to favorably consider the legislation early in this Congress, and look forward to working with him.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for arranging to have this discussion and talk about where we are going. That is, after all, what it is about. 
   I listened to my colleagues state their impression, their interpretation of last night's State of the Union Address, and it is right on target. What we really are faced with--all of us--is a vision of where we are going in this country, a broad vision in the long run of where we want to go and what we want to achieve and what it takes to cause that to happen. That is really the challenge that we have; the long-term goal in a broad 
   sense of things like freedom and opportunity and security, job security, business; smaller government rather than more, moving government back to people in communities. 
   Those are the long-term goals that we ought to have so that as we then put our agenda together, we have to ask how do these things fit. 
   When you talk about the things the President mentioned last night, 45 or whatever it was, how do they fit in this business of freedom, how do they fit in making Government smaller? So each, then, has a challenge to transfer our goals into the specifics that we talk about. 
   Collectively, we need an agenda for ourselves narrowed down to those things with which we really need to deal. Of course, we all have other issues, but there ought to be some priorities, and that is what we are doing and that is what the Senator is doing in setting an agenda. 
   We need to talk about Social Security and make it work. We need to make it work just as much for those who are now getting benefits as for those who are just beginning to pay in. That is one of the things we need to do. 
   Everyone knows we need to strengthen the military, and we must do that. This administration has not. We can do that. 
   Of course, we need to strengthen health care, but we don't need a national health care program. We already tried that. We already talked about that. We don't need to do that. We need to take pieces and strengthen the private sector. 
   Tax reform--I don't think there is a soul in this country who doesn't believe we need tax reform to make it more simple, but we are moving the other way. Every time we want to effect some behavior, as in the President's message last night, we give them a tax break--a tax break here, tax break there. We need to look at the overall reduction for all taxpayers and earners in this country. 
   Mr. President, it seems to me, rather than comment particularly on the State of the Union last night, I just am saying to myself and to you, let's take a look at our long-term goals of where we want to be over a period of time, measure those things that need to be done then immediately so that we can reach those goals, put some emphasis and priorities on a small number of items so that we can accomplish it and not have the same result the President did a year ago, when he listed almost the same number of events and, according to Broder in the Washington Post, was successful in one. 
   We have a chance to be successful within an agenda--Social Security, health care, strengthen the military, do something on crime, and simplify and reduce taxes. I hope that is our agenda. It is our agenda. I hope it is the President's agenda as well. That is what we ought to do this year. I yield the floor.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think it is great for us to get started with our work on the floor. We have been working, of course, in organizing our committees, drafting our bills, getting prepared--as a matter of fact, probably earlier than usual, despite the trial that is going on here. So it is good to get started. 
   I am pleased that our party has also an agenda. We will be talking about Social Security, of course. I think a great many changes need to be made there to ensure that this program continues, not only for those now drawing benefits but for those who will in the future. 
   We will be talking about education, seeking to get Federal help directly to the classrooms. 
   We will be talking about strengthening the military, which I think is very important and must be done. 
   I think tax reduction and tax reform is very high on our list of priorities. Certainly, we will be working on that. 
   Health care, of course, will be part of what we talk about. 
   And each of us, in addition to those, will have other issues. 
   So I rise to talk a moment this morning about biannual budgeting. It is a real pleasure for me to join the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, and chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator THOMPSON, to introduce a bill that will create a 2-year budgeting appropriations process. We worked long and hard on that issue. I have been working on it for some time, largely because it is my belief that the current budgeting process is broken. 
   After last year's massive omnibus appropriations bill, which was a debacle, of course, I argue that the budget process needs to be changed. We spend entirely too much time, both in the Congress and in the executive branch, on budget issues. 
   Since the most recent budget process reform in 1974, Congress has consistently failed to complete action on the budget by the time of the start of the fiscal year and, as a result, have increasingly relied on omnibus measures that come in at the end. 
   Last year's experience ought to ensure that we do, in fact, need a change. In fact, only 4 of the 13 regular appropriations bills were passed for funding for 10 cabinet-level departments, and the rest was crammed into a 24-hour budget session, which does not work well. Not a new idea. As a matter of fact, since 1950, Congress has failed on the 13 individual appropriations bills to be funded in every year except 2--only 2 years did we succeed in doing that. We routinely fund unauthorized expenditures and appropriations. The idea is to have an Authorization Committee and an Appropriations Committee. The authorization is made and then it is funded. That has not been the case. We need to change that. 
   In response to that, I introduced, in the 104th Congress, legislation that would create a biannual budget, and I am very pleased to join in with Senators DOMENICI and THOMPSON in offering this bill this year. This legislation does not eliminate the budgeting process. Each step serves an important role and will continue to do that. However, basically, we would simply be doing it for 2 years rather than 1, having the off year for oversight. 
   I happen to think that one of the principal obligations of the Congress is oversight of the kinds of programs that have been funded by this Congress. We have not had the opportunity to do that. We have extended debate on appropriations throughout almost the entire year in each year of the 2-year periods. Almost all of us come from States where a 2-year cycle program is used and is successful. It is not a brand new idea and it can be done. I am sure there will be resistance, largely from the appropriators, who rather enjoy the power plays that go on each year through the appropriations process. But I believe in the old saying that we have often heard that ``if you expect different results, you have to change the process.'' 
   The results we have had are not the kinds of results that most people would like to have. I think that it is high time for us to change the process, and I look forward very much to that.

   Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is an honor to once again join the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, and the Chairman of the Government Affairs Committee, Senator THOMPSON in introducing legislation to create a two year budget and appropriations process. We've all worked long and hard on this issue and I am hopeful that we can finally enact this common sense reform this year. 
   I've been saying for awhile that the current budget process is breaking down. After last year's debacle with the massive omnibus appropriations bill, I'd argue that the budget process is broken. Congress and the executive branch spend entirely too much time on budget issues. Since the most recent budget process reform in 1974, Congress has consistently failed to complete action on the Federal budget before the start of the fiscal year and, as a result, has increasingly relied on omnibus spending measures to fund the Federal Government. Last year's experience should dispel any lingering doubts about whether the current process is broken. In fact, only four of the 13 regular appropriations bills were passed  before funding for 10 Cabinet-level departments was crammed into one bill debated over just a 24 hour period. 
   The budget resolution, reconciliation bill and appropriations bill continue to become more time-consuming. In the process, authorizing committees are being squeezed out of the schedule. There are too many votes on the same issues and too much duplication. In the end, this time could be better spent conducting vigorous oversight of Federal programs which currently go unchecked. 
   In response to these problems, in the 104th Congress I introduced legislation that would create a biennial budget process. I am pleased to continue this effort by joining Senator DOMENICI and Senator THOMPSON in offering this bill. It will rectify many of the problems regarding the current process by promoting timely action on budget legislation. In addition, it will eliminate much of the redundancy in the current budget process. This legislation does not eliminate any of the current budget processes--each step serves an important role in congressional deliberations. However, by making decisions once every 2 years instead of annually, the burden should be significantly reduced. 
   Perhaps most importantly, biennial budgeting will provide more time for effective congressional oversight, which will help reduce the size and scope of the Federal Government. Congress simply needs more time to review existing Federal programs in order to determine priorities in our drive to balance the budget. 
   Another benefit of a 2 year budget cycle is its effect on long term planning. A biennial budget will allow the executive branch and State and local governments, all of which depend on congressional appropriations, to do a better job making plans for long term projects. 
   Two year budgets are not a novel idea. Nor will biennial budgeting cure all of the Federal Government's ills. However, separating the budget session from the oversight session works well across the country in our state legislatures. 
   This legislation is a solid first step toward reforming the congressional budget process. This concept enjoys strong bipartisan support. It is supported by the Clinton administration, Majority Leader LOTT and Minority Leader DASCHLE. In addition, 36 other Senators joined Senators DOMENICI, THOMPSON and I in sending a letter last year to Senate leaders calling for quick action on this bipartisan reform early this year. I am hopeful that effort and this bill will be a catalyst for swift action on this common sense, good government reform.
